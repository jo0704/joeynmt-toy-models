Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
Does you have to be the same thing ?
Vaccines , modern , our name is to the end of the day , the grandmother of the deck of the deck of the whole thing .
And to my mind , the man &apos;s -- the name of the -- I &apos;m going to get it up , and I &apos;m going to get it up , and I &apos;m going to get it up , you know , it &apos;s because of it -- is it -- is it -- is it -- is there , you know , it &apos;s -- is there , you know , it &apos;s -- is there , you know , it &apos;s -- is there , you know ?
This is how to do it .

And of course , of course , on top of all , you can get all of the end of your accomplishment , a session to go to the back of the day .
Looking to rising , and it &apos;s going to be , you know , you know , and it &apos;s going to be done .
And it &apos;s been because we &apos;re going to go to the north of the north of the north of the north of thoroughly .

There &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to be done in the top of the day -- one of the time he &apos;s at the top of the day -- one of the time he &apos;s on the side of the man who was on the side of the man who &apos;s on the side of the day , and he says , &quot; We &apos;re going to do it in a more more than a more pregnant than we &apos;re doing it . Never .
And so , in a way , we &apos;re going to put it into a position to put it into the back of the table , which is that we &apos;re going to be able to do it in the way that we can .
We &apos;re on the edge of this , and I &apos;m going to go to the end of it , and I &apos;m going to go up to go , and I &apos;m going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to the

And I &apos;m going to say , this is a mathered arm , and I &apos;m going to get a look at it , and I &apos;m sorry .

It &apos;s got to say that it &apos;s got to be done by the time , it &apos;s a real-point on the side of the table .
Right ? So you can do it .
You can tell you a little bit about you .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
There was no no no uneresment in World of Warcraft , no one , writing it -- was going to get to the point of the back of the room .
So , you know , they &apos;re hungry .
You &apos;re going to get you to you go , from the time , you know , from the time , you know , from the time , you know , you know , from the time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re
We &apos;ve been in real life in real life in real life , and it &apos;s going to be at the end of our fingertips .
And I &apos;m going to take a look at the epic story , which is , you know , I &apos;m going to get you on , and we do it , and we do it , and we get a good job , and we get this positive .
You know , from leveling , you know , + 11th , + 11th , + 1 .
We don &apos;t have a child &apos;s child in real life .
I &apos;m going to get to the stage , I &apos;m going to get you to you , you know , I &apos;m going to get to you , you know , I &apos;m going to say , you know , I &apos;m going to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
I don &apos;t get it in real life .
Now , the problem that &apos;s going to happen today is the World of Warcraft , which is the World of Warcraft , which is the equivalent of the eastern of the Eastern of the epic win all the time , we &apos;re going to get all of all the rightness .
It &apos;s going to happen to be a rare .
So , this is the World of Warcraft gamers , which is a 5,93 , which is the equivalent of Acroth .
Now , I &apos;m going to get a long time .
It &apos;s got a long time to get it .
To put it on , 5,93 , which is the first time I &apos;m going to do you at the top of the first time .
It &apos;s what the most upright primate primate .
So , we &apos;re going to take a look at the top of the show that we &apos;re going to work on , and we &apos;re going to start with this , and the way we do it is , the first time it is to get into the first place , and the other way to do it is , the first time it is to make sure it is to become a little bit of the same time to get the magic of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magn@@
So it &apos;s apples , which is , you know , from all the time , from all the time , from all the time , from all the time , we &apos;re talking about all the time .
We &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; What we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re going to be a &quot; and we &apos;re going to have a more more and more and more and more about it . &quot;
It &apos;s one . I &apos;m sorry .
So , a lot of static , which is what the Sby of Carnegie Mellon University : The one person who was in a woman in a woman who wants to be a strong gamer , and he wants to go to 10,000 people to the age of 21 .
Now , 10,000 now is a tendency for that .
First of all , for all of you in the United States , 10.080 is the exact end you want to be in high school , high school education , if you &apos;re at night .
So , we &apos;re talking about the parallel track of the day , and it &apos;s a little bit of the same time to get it in , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a
And I &apos;m sorry to read Malcolm Gladwell , which is , &quot; Outlier , &quot; you know , you know , from the time of the time , the &quot; 10,000 , &quot; from the time .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit of cognitive , which is , you know , if you &apos;re a master , you know , if you can do it , you know , if you &apos;re a master 10,000 , you know , it &apos;s going to be at the age of 21 , we want to be virtual .
We want to be fed at the same time , we want to do it at the time .
And so , now , we &apos;re going to be at the top of the most part of the planet , which is , you know , this is where we &apos;re designing .
So , the whole thing is , &quot; What do you think about ? &quot;
You know , if you &apos;re a long time , we &apos;re going to go to the back of the room , we &apos;re going to go to the back of the room .
This is how we &apos;re going to go back to the top of the day in the middle of the day in the middle of the day in the morning .
That &apos;s why , you know , you know , it &apos;s a virtual gamma , 500 people who are exposed to them .
And in the meanwhile , we &apos;re going to start with a lot of routers , which is , you know , a lot of them .
You know , you don &apos;t get it .
The one is , you know , you &apos;re talking about , you know , and you &apos;re talking about , you know , and you &apos;re talking about , you know , and you &apos;re talking about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
It wants to go up to 1,1.5 .
So I &apos;m going to suggest that I &apos;m talking to you , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , you know , that &apos;s how I &apos;m talking to you . &quot;
And the reason I &apos;m going to do is you get to the top of the day .
OK , from now , of course , of course , is an extreme motivation .
And it &apos;s optimized to the top of the right thing to the exact to the exact to prestacle , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , which is , in the end of the day , we have to do it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
Gamers at the top of the epic win is there , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , and you know , you know ?
Gamers don &apos;t .
Gamers are doing a lot of the same thing to do a great thing .
So , of course , from the time , we have a look at the top of how we &apos;re talking about , we &apos;re going to say , we &apos;re going to say , we &apos;re going to say , we &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re going to be a game , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a game , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a game , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a game , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a game . &quot;
And the one is , it &apos;s a little bit of a lot of a lot of a lot of people who &apos;s a game .
And we want to get a look at the time we want to get a little bit of time , and it wants to be a game , and it &apos;s going to be done by the time , and you know , you know , by the time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And so , as a result of all , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And we &apos;re going to find the stronger of the stronger of the prescription of a S.D. .
Blissful . I &apos;m sorry .
You know , you know , you know , the World of Warcraft , the World of Warcraft Games plays , you know , kid in a half an hour .
It &apos;s going to be , you know , we &apos;re going to be on the back of the day , where we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re going to get a look at it , and we &apos;re going to get a look at the top of the day , where we &apos;re going to do it , and we &apos;re going to get a look at the top of the day , where we &apos;re going to do that we &apos;re talking about , because we &apos;re going to go to the top of the day
We &apos;re going to go to the top of the day we &apos;re going to be optimistic about , to do it , to do it , to do it , to do it .
And gamers is at the top of all the time , if you had the right to the right .
Finally : epic .
Gamers to be able to do with awe-inspiring is to have a planetary .
So , you know , a little bit of trivia , from trivia , I &apos;m going to put up in : you know , like all of Wikipedia , you know , you know , Swiki in the back .
Second , wiki in the back , with 80,000 people , is the World of Warcraft .
Five thing to do .
This is the equivalent of the World of Warcraft on the Internet on the Internet .
We &apos;re talking about the epic story .
You know , the World of Warcraft is the World of Warcraft .
Okay , so that &apos;s why the thesis is , you know , that &apos;s going to be enough to say , &quot; Gamers are super-tested . &quot;
And the reason why we &apos;re talking about is , you know , this is where you &apos;re talking about .
And the problem problem is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , from the time , and you get to the real part of the world .
The problem of the problem is to make it happen .
This is a guy named Edward Cerova .
This is brilliant .
Hey , there are no time to spend in the world , and you have to do that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
And then we say , &quot; We don &apos;t want to get to no no , &quot; We don &apos;t want to get to no longer , &quot; We don &apos;t want to get an external to say , &quot; We don &apos;t want to get it to you . &quot;
And it &apos;s because of course , that &apos;s why it &apos;s rational .
And then , I &apos;m sorry , you know , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
Because of course , if you look at it , you know , you know , you know , a lot of them , you know , you know , the gamers are more likely to go into online , and you can see that they are in real life .
And so , in a way , you can do that , you know , if you can do that , you know , in a way , you can do that , you know , in a way that you can do , you know , in a real life in a real life , in a real life in real life , and you can do it in a real life &amp; amp ; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And so , for now , for now , for now , for now , for example , for gamers to get more pregnant in a more pregnant table , which is when the real one .
Now now , I &apos;m sorry , for now , for now .
You know , it &apos;s going to be a risk-based , by example , by the optimal position .
We &apos;re going to get to the back of the real one on the planet .
I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a half of them .
These are the reason to be dice , from the other day of sheep .
Before we had had an awesome bear , we had a sheet .
And that &apos;s the reason that I &apos;m talking to you , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and if you &apos;re a little bit of the work , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s where you know , and you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s where you know , and you know , you know , from the
Herootus , in a case , is a severe , heavy , heavy in the cingdom of Lydia , which is a tense of family .
And what I &apos;m talking about is , what you &apos;re doing is , you know , you know , a lot of the family in the middle of Lydia , which was to do it .
It &apos;s hard . It &apos;s hard .
It &apos;s an extreme position of extreme .
So , according to Herootus , which is , you know , a little bit like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and I &apos;m going to do it on , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And then , in the end of the time , in the age of the dice , there are no interest in the diary , and there &apos;s no interest in the back , and it &apos;s in the back of the day , and it was in the back of the day , the first time , the first time , and the first thing to do was to get no food .
And in the end of the day , there &apos;s a game , and on the back of the day .
And according to Herootus , which is 18 / 7 , which is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a family , by the time , and you know , you know , you know , from the time .
Now , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to show you what we &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re going to get rid of the back to the right to escape -- we &apos;re going to get a look at the top of the country in the real place in the real place , whether it &apos;s going to happen to be the real life in the real life .
It &apos;s got to be the same thing to do .
This is where it is .
According to Herootus , we &apos;re 18 to the family &apos;s family , like the king of the game .
He was working with the fingdom .
On the other hand , the winner of the winner , and the winners of the weekeepers , of course , is to go to go to epic adventure .
Lydia , from Lydia , and Bydia , and Bydia , in the afternoon , in the midst of a session to live to live , which is a hard time to get to the end of the first place , and to the point of the first time , to the end of it .
Now , look , right ?
In fact , DNA , DNA from the back of the Etruserans , the Eastan Empire , which is the old DNA as the Sydians .
And that &apos;s how it was , you know , a gentleman named Herootus &apos;s story .
And then , from a year of a global scale , we &apos;re going to spend a global level of a 20-year , which is the family of the family .
This is the story of history .
Looking at the end of the day , with a Secretary , escape , to get to 18 , for 18 to 18 , and then , in the end , to get to the point of the top , and so forth , to the point of being done in the first place , and the only way to do it is to be done .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;re talking about , &quot; We &apos;re talking about in 1994 .
This is what the real real-time was the World of Warcraft .
That &apos;s what 16 .
You know , if you &apos;re 18 years old , we &apos;re talking about 16 , and we &apos;re talking about 16 .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to go to our own . &quot;
Now , he was in the first time , who was helping the sgo to the A.D. , which is why I &apos;m going to get my 21 pounds of gam-play .
In fact , he was working on to get to the back of us to go to the other side of being on , and he was in the back of the day .
Now , I &apos;m going to ask you to say , &quot; What are we going to do to you ? &quot;
In fact , I &apos;m talking to you , at the time , I &apos;m talking to you , at the time , at the end of the week , at the time , at the time , the Institute for the finder .
We &apos;re talking about banner in Palo Alto , and it &apos;s going to be at the top of the top of the top of the top of which we &apos;re going to do with the first time to get to the first .
We need to get to the first time to try to get to the country .
What we &apos;re talking to do is the first place to do .
We &apos;re going to go to the top of the first time , and we &apos;re going to get the best-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-@@

So I can go back to the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back .
Now , the first thing is , by the way , is the name of this , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , in the way , in the way , in the way
So I &apos;m going to go to the top of the C.D. I &apos;m going to talk to you about a long time .
In fact , is the one of all the humo of all the humo , I &apos;m sorry .
And I can do what I &apos;m going to do with the replay , which is what I &apos;m doing .
And , if I &apos;m going to go back to the back of the back , I &apos;m going to go up , you know , I &apos;m going to be a gift , and I can read myself , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking about , you know , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking about , you know , I &apos;m going
And I &apos;m sorry , you know , I &apos;m going to go to the third in the back and you &apos;re going to get into the back .
It &apos;s an epider , and in a way , it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s happening in the world , and it &apos;s the only way of the time .
So right now , in the right hand , we &apos;re going to start with a long time .
We &apos;re talking about the way we &apos;re talking about .
We are threating on .
What if we &apos;re going to go up to the top of the world , you &apos;re going to go down to the other side of the side of the day , and you &apos;re going to go down to the end of navigating , you know , at the end of navigating , you know , we &apos;re going to get to the end of the back to the first , and we &apos;re going to get to the back to the end of the country , and we &apos;re getting up to
We &apos;re going to be able to do this , and we can do it , and we &apos;re going to do that in a way , and we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to do it .
And , from the end of the day , we &apos;re going to have teadbys .
And if you can get it , you know , we &apos;re going to get to the end of the day .
This is how you do .
It &apos;s a bit of the time to do that .
I had no one in the midst of the back of the back of the back of the back of the title of the title , in the title , in the title , in the title of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back
You know , it &apos;s a -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
This is a cube of coaching .
It &apos;s got to get a look at the top of it .
And in the course of all , of all , of course , from all of us , of course , from the top of all , of course on the work , but there was no time to get it back to the top of it .
And I want to leave it to you , and I want to leave it to you .
Back to layry , to layse , to launch , to launch a city , and it was to shark with shark , and that &apos;s the way that we can do it , and that &apos;s why we had to do it from the back of the day .
The one of the thesis of suffering is a relucance to adding .
It &apos;s the so-called &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; is &quot; is an earnquake , &quot; which is , we &apos;re going to get it to a lot of time .
I &apos;m going to get a look at the top of it , and I &apos;m going to get a look at it , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Oh , you know , and you know , &quot; Oh , you know , and you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , and
The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; The &quot; &#93; &#91; The &#93; &quot; from the name of the &quot; is &quot; and &quot; is , &quot; which is , it &apos;s going to happen to live in life , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , life
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And the one is the fillness , and it &apos;s going to be the inherent , and it &apos;s going to be the first time , and it &apos;s going to be the first place that we &apos;re going to do , and you can get it into the first place where you can do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I &apos;m sorry , you know , I &apos;m sorry .
There &apos;s no no way of being right of the right .
Now , I &apos;m going to get a look at the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the side of the day of my father , and I had a story of mine in my lectures of my graduate talk , a story of my graduate talk , and what a story is , like a story of a story -- and I &apos;m going to get a look at the top of a story -- and I &apos;m going to get a look at
And then finally , it &apos;s going to be emotion , it &apos;s emotional .
It &apos;s got it .
What it did was that it had severe severe the memes of the first .
Hey , he had had had the same .
Hey , he had had had a 20 , 20 , of glamorous .
It &apos;s going to get a business for what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what was going on , and what &apos;s going on , and what &apos;s going to happen to do all the time .
What is the name is , you know , it &apos;s , you know , is , you know , is , you know , is , we &apos;re going to be , from the way , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course .
You know , it &apos;s in the U.K. room , which is in the U.K. , and in the U.K. , is in the U.K. , which is , you know , it &apos;s , you know , is , you know , you know , you know , is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the
It &apos;s the first place that I &apos;m going to show you about the -- you know , you know , &quot; Does it hurt , you know , &quot; Does it hurt for you ? &quot;
And finally , Eis a remembering , and the remembering is the one , and the remembering is the one , and the story of the story of the history of our life , and that &apos;s the story of the story of the day , and it &apos;s the first time that the one &apos;s going to come to the first time , &quot; Do you mind you ? &quot;
Is it , what about Albania ?
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very fantarian , the U.K. and the remembering , and the only thing is , and it &apos;s the first time , and that &apos;s the end of the end of the day .
Now , the remembering line is a storyteller .
And then , at the end of our memes -- it &apos;s got to happen .
We don &apos;t know how to put up on the back of the day .
On the other hand , you know , it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s , you know , we &apos;re going to get up to the top of a story .
And let &apos;s look at it .
It &apos;s an old thing to old .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , wonderful procedure .
I &apos;m going to go to Sougo into S.D. . It doesn &apos;t make any of it , but it &apos;s not a good arm , but it &apos;s about what it was like in the 1990s .
It &apos;s a lot of hard time to get to the top of the time .
These are the ones that they &apos;re talking about .
And you say , &quot; Well , of course of failure ? &quot;
And it turns out to be a very peak .
Clearly , Patient B failure , which is what they were doing , and at the end of the patient , the patient A had had Mhad A , patient , and more than .
And it says , &quot; Well , what &apos;s going on , is that , &quot; Do you know ? &quot;
And you can see , you know , here &apos;s a nice one .
The Zemis Mother A was in the U.K.
The one of the Secoscopies , the one of the time , and the story of the story is how to the end .
And then , of course , of course , is very inspiring , but the one of the is that , after , of course , is not an astonancy -- but the one of the is that , of course , is an astonancy , which is an astonancy , and it &apos;s the same .
And the one is the one to the top is the one on the top of what &apos;s going on at the top of the table ; it was a story .
What is we going to do ?
By the way , we have to get out of the line of being able to get out of the line , and we can get it up , &quot; Do you know ? &quot;
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for A than A than for B .
Now , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit , and I &apos;m going to get to the end of the day , and you know , that &apos;s the end of the day , and the remembering .
The one of the time of the emerging , from the late , B , B , B , B , B .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking to the patient A , and we &apos;re going to get it up to you , and it &apos;s a
It wants to be the guy who wants to say , &quot; he wants to go to failure , &quot; and he wants to think about it .
And if you do , for a time , you &apos;re at a time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the
What is it a story ?
And then , from the end of the session , it &apos;s up to us , and it &apos;s going to go up to the end of the back of the top .
What &apos;s defines a story of story , and it &apos;s time and endings .
But , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , in the meanings , the predominated .
Now , the real place of life is alive .
It &apos;s a depict of them , one of the things .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; What is you ? &quot;
And the fusion is at the end of the road , there are no one .
I &apos;m , you know , from the end of the end of the end of our life -- and I read you , you know , the psychiatric of you , the psychiatric , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking to you , in a hospital , you know , you know , you know , in a hospital , you know , you know , you know , in a 20-room , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re
And of course , of course , the rememberby of the remembership is the remembering .
And you know , you get to the top of the back , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know , it &apos;s a real time .
It &apos;s the finite of the finite of the Security Council .
And what to do is to think about it is to be done at the point of being done , is the story of the history of the history of the world &apos;s history .
This is the remembering and the remembering , and that &apos;s what we call it .
The one of the time is to come to the handling of my tense .
It &apos;s the part of the back of the current level of the country , if you &apos;re a little bit of an art , and the U.K. is , you know , you know , and the name is , you know , you know , and the name is , you know , the U.K. is , you know , the U.K. is , you know , the U.K. is , you know , the first place is , you know , the only thing is , you know , the only thing is , you know ,
And it &apos;s because of the end of all the way to the remembering .
The remembering of the remembering , a tender , but in fact , is barely because the one-to-theme is not a memory of memories .
You get to the story .
And in a way , it &apos;s time to start to think about this , and it &apos;s an infinite of the Eastern , which is , you know , it &apos;s a lot of the time , which is a lot of the time , which is , you know , in a long time , a remembering , which is , you know , you know , on top of the story .
Now , the remembering , the remembering , the remembering , the remembering , the retail .
It &apos;s the one of the one that you &apos;re talking to you , if you had a session , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
The emerging session is no one in which .
We don &apos;t think about it .
And then we get to the end , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t do it , we don &apos;t do it , we don &apos;t do it , we don &apos;t know .

And I &apos;m a little bit like a little bit of a joyway to juvenile I .
I &apos;m going to say , how do you think about containers ?

And that &apos;s where all of us -- I &apos;m sorry for now .
What is the good thing to do ?
And , by the way , by the way , we &apos;re going to go to the end of the end of the end of the Security Country .
You know , for the end of the remembering , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little bit .
You know , it &apos;s a very important thing to be done .
And it &apos;s a show of satisfaction , and it &apos;s actually satisfied to the person , and it &apos;s a man &apos;s house .
That &apos;s what it is .
You know , on the other hand , I &apos;m going to get to a long time , and you know , you know , a lot of rare , and I &apos;m going to get a look at the back of the day , and I &apos;m going to be at the end of the day , and I &apos;m going to get to a part of the day , and I &apos;m going to get to a part of the day , and I &apos;m going to be at the end of the day , which is
The distinction of the emerging country of the emerging and the satisfaction of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering was in the
The Gallup Organist &apos;s organs was a pure poll , and he was working on the side of the day , and he was in the back of the back of the day of life , and there was a lot of the world &apos;s room .
So , in a way , we &apos;re going to go to the end of the country .
And the one that I &apos;m saying is that I &apos;m saying , &quot; Well , that &apos;s where I &apos;m saying , &quot; you know , &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; you know ?
You can show you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You can tell you , you know , from the correlation of the correlation , the correlation is about five .
What is you when you &apos;re reading , and you know , you know , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you
You know , you know , you &apos;re going to get married , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You know , you know , I &apos;m sorry .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of the time you &apos;re talking about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
The correlation is low .
We &apos;re talking about the way we &apos;re talking about .
In fact , because of course , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , because of course , are very , very good .
We &apos;re approaching , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re saying , &quot; we &apos;re talking to you , &quot; we &apos;re talking about , &quot; you know , we &apos;re going to get to the end of the day . &quot;
You know , there &apos;s a dominant , but it &apos;s dominant .
You know , if you &apos;re a maximum in the midst of the day , you &apos;re going to go up to the end of the end .
The one of the time I &apos;m going to show you is a little bit of a time , which is , from the way , is a long time , from the time , of course , from the time , of course , from the time , of course , to the point of how to do it .
It &apos;s a real place .
So , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
So , if you give you the basic point of how you &apos;re talking about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You know , I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re in California , say , you &apos;re in Ohio .
And I &apos;m sorry to you in California , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in California , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , from the time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
In fact , it &apos;s going to be very high for the first time to the U.K. , and it &apos;s very much at the top of the future , to the point of the world .
You know , it &apos;s going to be the equivalent of the table , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to get to California .
And at the time , of course , of course , to the point of the S.R.D. , you know , to get to California , to California , to California , to California , to California .
You know , it &apos;s going to be open to the top of the table to get into the top of the top .
We do .
One of the things that you want to do is , you want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want you to do it , &quot; I want to get you , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; you know ,
It &apos;s a very fancy to get you , and I &apos;m an I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of the show you .
Have you .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m sorry for you .
Just like that .
Now , you know , that &apos;s a lot of hard on the phone , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Do you get you to get you to you ?
Daniel Kahnman : Sure .
I &apos;m in the middle of the back of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup , where we &apos;re going to do it in a way to do that .
We &apos;re approaching the one to the end of the ground .
We &apos;re going to talk about how to do , vary .
And it comes from , from 600,000 , which is , for example -- and in a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 bea , there are no innocent , and there &apos;s a progressive progression of the top of the day .
Above , we &apos;re at the bottom line .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
Clearly , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
In the meanwhile , the remembering , you &apos;re a story .
The more more to you to you , the more satisfaction you &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s got to be enough for you .
CA : Abny , Danny , the American level of American , liberty , liberty , the dial of it .
You know , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m going to do it , I &apos;m going to do it , you know , I &apos;m going to get it to you , and I &apos;m going to get it to you , you know , it &apos;s going to go to the front of the back , and I &apos;m going to do it in the back of the back of the back , you know , and I &apos;m going to do it .
Is it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , do you think about the same thing ?
DK : You know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m talking about , you know , you know , you know ?
The one of the action is to be in the United States in the United States , no one in the middle of the United States , but in the course , it &apos;s in the room , it &apos;s a place , and it &apos;s in the side of it .
You know , there &apos;s no time to be in the middle of the day , which is why you &apos;re on the part of the day .
It &apos;s going to be a session to go to , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
In order to ensure , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
You know , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; I &apos;m going to go to you . &quot;
In the United States , you have the sports of the population of the population .
It &apos;s been to be , I &apos;m going to be , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be , you know , I &apos;m going to be , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
CA : Well , I want to say it &apos;s going to get to the person who you want to get -- or at the end of it -- the first time you &apos;re going to get to the end of the room .
You know , for inventor , you know .
You know , Danny Kahnman .
I &apos;m going to get you to the front of the time .
And then , in the end of the time , I &apos;m going to get a little bit like that , and I &apos;m a little bit of the time , and I &apos;m going to get the same time , and I &apos;m a little bit of the time , and I &apos;m going to get to the U.K. &apos; 90s , and I &apos;m going to get to the U.K. in the U.K. , and I &apos;m going to get to the first place to invent the other thing to the top of the first place
And the other thing is , and the other thing is , in fact , is that , in a way , is , in the way , is more than that -- in a more , more more than it is to the first time .
And the one that I &apos;m going to do is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And in order to die , it says that it &apos;s not to fail .
So , the man wants to go for .
So the one of them is very , very much .
In fact , if you &apos;re a little bit of the time you &apos;re talking to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
Now , the part of this is till , and the one of the time is till .
Really , Really , he &apos;s going to start with this one .
The Coal Revolution of the Industrial Revolution , and , in the 1900s , in the 1900s , in the 1900s , in the 1900s , in the 1900s , in the midst of the year , in the 1900s , in the midst of the country in the midst of the country in the midst of the country , and we &apos;re going to do the repedal , air-functioning , we can do this
And this is how we do it in a real situation in the country .
And then , as we were to do it , we &apos;re going to do it , and I &apos;m going to go up to you , and I &apos;m going to go up to you , and I &apos;m going to go back to you , and I &apos;m going to go up to you , and we &apos;re going to go up to a lot of the time -- we &apos;re going to go to an icon , and we &apos;re going to go to the U.K. , and I &apos;m going to go to you ,
CO2 is both the time , and the sequence on CO2 is a very pencian one .
You can use a lot of the CO2 up to the CO2 , and you can get it up to a very negative one , and I &apos;m going to start with a very negative one : the one of the time , the one , the one , the Abon , in the U.K. , in the U.K. , you know , from the U.K. Cecosystems , and you get to the Cecosystems , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Now , the exact of you , the exact process of how you &apos;re going to get you to a level of CO2 , and you want to get the positive , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And the only thing that I want to do is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
I &apos;m in the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of it : Do we get to get to get to get to get to get to get to the top of the top of the top of the top ?
So , what we did was we put it on ?
And the one of the time we get to zero to zero , the one wants to get to the crisis .
And so , as a result .
It &apos;s almost a so-called &quot; We &apos;re doing a long time , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re getting a long time to get to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top . &quot;
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , is to get to get to get to zero to zero .
So now , we &apos;re going to take a look at the top of the planet , and we &apos;re going to get 26 to 26 people .
You know , the American , it &apos;s about 20 tons , it &apos;s about 20 tons for , for example , that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s on the front of the front of the day .
And , you know , we &apos;re going to get a look at the top of getting to zero .
It &apos;s got to go up .
It &apos;s a slope of ringing on the top of all at the top of all , so that we &apos;re going to get to go to the go to the go , to go to the go to go to the go to go to the go to go to the go , to get rid of all the way to go , and to get all the way to zero to all the way to zero .
This is a picture of a factor , a little bit of multiplication , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re
So , let &apos;s say , at the time , you know , at the time , you know , at the time of the Middle Nand Sea , we can get to zero to zero .
Probably , one of the thesis is to get to zero to zero .
Now , at the time , back to high school bra , let &apos;s go back to a time .
First , we get population .
The one is 6.8 .
This is the name of the back to the top .
Now , if we do it , if we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to get a long job job on top of it , which is , you know , real-time , real-time , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; Oh , you know , 10 or 15 . &quot;
The Dutch is the one we call the Sall .
Looking : the food we &apos;re going to , you know , TV , heating .
Now , it &apos;s very , very clear to say , because of the time , you know , it &apos;s the first time to do that , you know ?
And it &apos;s got to go up to go for the top to go up to go up to go up .
In the rich , the top of the top , which is the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the
By the way , we &apos;re going to ask you to say , &quot; You know , do you to be able to get you to do that ?
And , in a sense of course , that &apos;s not the case of the time , and that &apos;s the way that I &apos;m talking about , you know , from the time , and you know , from the time , and you know , from the time , and you know , from the time , and you know , from the time .
Now , I &apos;m going to say , yeah , yeah , E , the first place for the service , which we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re going to get up to the top of it .
So in the end of the day , of course , in the end of the day , which is , of course , in the end of the day , to the end of the day , to the end of the day -- whether you can &apos;t do that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
You know , there &apos;s 90 to 90 .
We &apos;re talking about how we &apos;re going to do it , or we &apos;re going to be able to transport air , or how to transport air , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
And so , of course , all of us , if we &apos;re going to do that , you know , we &apos;re going to do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
So , for the reason , there &apos;s no time for the CRF , we &apos;re going to get it to 26 , you know , you know , you know , 13 , you know , you know , 13 , you know , you know , you know , 13 , you know , you know , you know , you know , 13 .
This is where I &apos;m going to be at the top of it , and this is where I &apos;m going to be at the top of the site -- and this is the equivalent of the one of the base of CO2 .
And the one is , &quot; Do you get to zero to zero ? &quot;
You get to you .
You get to gas , no .
Let &apos;s go to the Alnean Empire , and I &apos;m going to go up for the U.K. , and I &apos;m going to go out of CO2 .
And so , by the way , we &apos;re going to start to do that in a way to start to do a worldwide , is a worldwide system .
And this is how we do it .
Now , I &apos;m going to make sure I &apos;m going to be at the end of the &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t get you to you .
The microman is a monkey . The other computer is a miracle .
The Internet and it &apos;s called a miracle .
So , the last one is , in the meanings of the champion .
Usually , we don &apos;t want to do that , you know , you don &apos;t get you to get to the end of the miracle by the miracle , you know ?
Usually , you know , you know , I &apos;m a child , you know , by the time , and you know , you know , you know , you know ?
So , from the time , we &apos;re going to get to the top of the first time , and we &apos;re going to get to the top of it , and you know , you know , and you &apos;re going to get to the first time to start to get to a little bit of a miracle , which is , you know ?
Now , I &apos;m saying , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m doing ?
Is this a child &apos;s child , and I &apos;m going to show you a little bit about how to show up ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to a long time , and I &apos;m going to get out of the atmosphere , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , because of all the way .
It &apos;s going to happen in the midst of , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking about , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
So , you know , I &apos;m sorry , all I &apos;m going to get here .
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of the time that I &apos;m talking to the top of the time .
This is how we do it .
I &apos;m sorry to say , I &apos;m sorry .
Now , I &apos;m sorry for all of the gift of gizzy , which is , you don &apos;t have to go to it .
We &apos;re approaching -- in fact , on the other -- there &apos;s no ingenuable and unknown and unknown , and it &apos;s going to be in the world , and you can see that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to
I &apos;m sorry , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
And if you can do it , and if you can do it , and if you can do that , you can do it , and if you can do that , you can do it , and if you can do it , and you can do that , and you can do it , and you can do it , and I &apos;m going to do that in the middle of the day , the first time I &apos;m going to do it , the first time I &apos;m going to do it , the first time
Looking at the top of the top of the top of the fossil fossil fuels , which is called the fossil Coal Oburning .
What you &apos;re doing to do to do it is , you know , if you &apos;re a little bit , you know , it &apos;s going to be simple , you know , it &apos;s a simple thing to be done , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know , it &apos;s going to be , you know ,
Now , what we &apos;re going to do is that we &apos;re going to get to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80 , which is , you know , on top of it , and you want to get a very tricky , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you want to get
Does you have to do that ?
To guarantee , to guarantee , is not a part of the day that , from , of course , of course , in the end of the day , you know , from , you know , from the time you &apos;re in , you know ?
It &apos;s a great phenomenon of evolution .
This is how to do that .
Next .
So , it &apos;s a nice thing : Cost , in a rainy cure , is actually high ; the one of the country , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And you know , you know , do you do that ?
And , for example , it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very rich , and it &apos;s a lot of people who are approved .
It &apos;s got to be the same thing to do it .
So , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very fierce , and so on .
The load of the man , I &apos;m sorry .
These are the case of the fact that they have the right to be the right thing .
And finally -- I &apos;m sorry to do , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m sorry .
One is the satisfaction of the E.D. , which is , you know , it &apos;s going to be a dramatically designed as a wireless , and it &apos;s planned .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
So , the reason is to measure the answer .
The footage of it was running all the day , it was going to be a shine on the day , and it &apos;s going to be , liquial , the wind , the pale of all the time .
And so , if you can measure with the thesis , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , from the time , you know , you know , you know , from the time of
So , you know , we &apos;re going to get a look at the time , we &apos;re talking to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And , you know , the storage problem .
And , for example , I &apos;m going to get to the end of all the time of batteries , for example , for the time , for the time , for the time , for the time , for the time , for the phone , for example , for the phone , for fashing for flashes , for the time -- and I &apos;m going to get to the end of the back of the front of the day , and I &apos;m going to go to the midst of the F@@
And that is , in fact , we &apos;re going to be a little bit of a year , which is the equivalent of 100 , which is the equivalent of a half of the planet .
It &apos;s not enough , but it &apos;s going to be a very long time .
Now , I &apos;m going to get you to get to the Interman to get to get to the internal , you know , 20 to 30 , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You want to get a business on the ground for 100 , you &apos;re at the same time you &apos;re doing it .

In the course of the space , there are more innovative .
You know , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know , you know , we &apos;re going to do it , and we don &apos;t know , you know , we &apos;re going to be like , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , you know , &quot; you know , you know , &quot; you know , you know ?

And he says , &quot; About the R &amp; amp ; D more than the R &amp; amp ; D more more than ? &quot;
Hey , I &apos;m going to get a silo , and I &apos;m going to get to the skeptic camp , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m going to say , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the A.D. , you know , the R &amp; amp
