You know, Several at TED, Peter Skillman, and Peter Skillman, who is the marshmallow.
And the next thing: Technology of Eastern was the tallest of the toughest of the toughest, from 20 birds of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yield, one yard and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow is to the top of the top.
And it turns out that it's a simple, it's a simple thing to do it, and it's a very good thing to do it.
And this is what I'm talking about, and I'm talking about it, and I'm an inherent, and I'm inherent, and I'm an infanteated piece of design.
And that's what a session.
And finally, I'm going to get a 70 design hill, and I'm going to show up the CTO of the Rune 50, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know

It's got to be a long time, and you know, you know, you know, you know?
This is the one of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the end of the day, which is the wrong place of the periphery of the periphery.
And then, in the end of the end of the day, it was a long time of traveling, and it was the marshmallow, and in the end of the marshmallow, and at the end of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top
It's a long time, from the time, from the end, is the name of the tack of the tack of the taxroom, "The ta-da," "O.U.U.U.U.U.," from the end of the marshmallow, which is the Sall of the marshmallow, which is the Sall of the Marshmallow, which is the Secretle of the Smarshmal@@

And that's what it is.
In Peter, you know, you know, you know, it's going to happen to be the first place to do the toughest, and it's the first part of all of us.
As the one of you, you know, is you? What is it? What is it? What is it?
And Peter likes to say, from the end of the man, to the man, to the end of the man's E.D., at CEO of Spaghetti, Inc.
It doesn't seem to be fun for power to power.
This is a nice guy.
And the one is, you know, the right thing is, you know, you know, right?
And the execute it is.
And finally, finally, is it in the top of the marshmallow on the top, which is it going to be a long time of endlessness?
It's a bit.

This is CEOs, a little bit like that, but it's a little bit like that, but it's a little bit more like that, but it's going to be a little bit.
If you put you in executive administration on the team, you have to get it to you.

My greatus, all of you, from the time, by the time, by the time, by the time, by the time, by the time, by the time, by the time.
My name was about 70 to 70.
My name is about two.
This is how it was, at the end of my mind.
It's got to be an earthquake that's going to be, which is, you know, it's a bit like, you know, it's a bit like, you know, you know, you know?
A, in New Delhi, you can get to live in New Delhi, you know, to live to live in the late 100, you know, you know about 100.
You know, it's about, it's done.
And here is it?
Smallpox. Smallpox, on the other hand.
It's been respected by the steel of the globe, in a way of no no.
It's about it. It's a disaster.
We vanished it. Poff.
In the rich, there is no generated by the way we can do it.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio...
Does you have to be the same thing?
Vaccines, modern, our name is to the end of the day, the grandmother of the deck of the deck of the whole thing.
And to my mind, the man's -- the name of the -- I'm going to get it up, and I'm going to get it up, and I'm going to get it up, you know, it's because of it -- is it -- is it -- is it -- is there, you know, it's -- is there, you know, it's -- is there, you know, it's -- is there, you know?
This is how to do it.
Unfortunately, all of all of the people who are in the room is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And of course, of course, on top of all, you can get all of the end of your accomplishment, a session to go to the back of the day.
Looking to rising, and it's going to be, you know, you know, and it's going to be done.
And it's been because we're going to go to the north of the north of the north of the north of thoroughly.
Such water, arable land, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
So the one is, what is we going to do? And I'm going to go.
I'm going to suggest that I'm going to suggest that we're going to get a lot of food, and it's going to go to the end of the country, and I'm going to get to the land of the country.
I'm going to suggest that we're going to make power power, which is, you know, it's going to be done.
I'm talking to you, you know, no, no, it's not a nice.
There's the one that's going to be done in the top of the day -- one of the time he's at the top of the day -- one of the time he's on the side of the man who was on the side of the man who's on the side of the day, and he says, "We're going to do it in a more more than a more pregnant than we're doing it. Never.
And so, in a way, we're going to put it into a position to put it into the back of the table, which is that we're going to be able to do it in the way that we can.
We're on the edge of this, and I'm going to go to the end of it, and I'm going to go up to go, and I'm going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to the
You know, if you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
I want to get it to the end of the room.
And, yeah, there is a tendency to the beginning of the world, which is the tendency to the point of the world.
Do you want to get you to become an advocate?
You need to get a high school. Sorry. Sorry, you know?
And then I'm going to get a look at it.
About, About, I'm a story about the New Yorker magazine.
And I'm going to focus on, and I'm going to get to the point of being done, you know, to the point of being on, you know, the top is to get all the way back to the top.
I'm sorry to do it, so I'm sorry to do, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
And I'm going to say, I'm going to say, a story of a story, I'm going to have a different story of food.
Same, come.
It's very severe.
So I'm a story of a story of a story, and I'm going to tell you what I'm talking about, and I'm going to say, "Oh, you know," I'm talking to you, "I'm talking to you," I'm talking to you, "I'm talking to you in a room, which is a haphazard, which is a haphazard, which is what damage to do.
You know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm in the story.
I'm sorry, I'm a journalist.
We're saying, we're going to get fiers, we're going to go to it. It's going to be done.
And I'm going to say, this is a mathered arm, and I'm going to get a look at it, and I'm sorry.
And then, in a way, it's a very difficult thing to start with all the time in the first time.
It's a severe, it's hard.
It's hard to get serious about that.
And that's what it is like.
You know, you know, I'm sorry, you know, I'm going to be here.
We're at a time in which we don't have the first time to go to the first place to get to the first place to do it.
We're talking about it.
We put it in ironic, and it's the other thing to say, "Well."
Okay, so we're talking about, and I'm going to say, "Well, you know, we're talking about."
We're approaching, in the meanings, in the realm, and we're in love with no, and we don't want to do that.
You want to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, "You know, you know," you know, you know?
Chernobyl, Beral, the Challenger, Vioxx, the champion, the Challmax, the Challmax, the Challmax, the Challmax.
You know, you know, you're not going to be honest.
And the reason we're doing is that we're going to get a very severe, and it's hard to get the right.
Technology, for example, is a project.
Don't get a great time.
One of the time you're talking about the first is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And the one that I'm going to say is that I'm going to say, "Well, I'm going to say," Well, you know, you know, I'm going to go to the epidemic of the epidemic of the epidemic of the epidemic of the Eastern, and you know, you know, I'm going to get you to see here.
About 12, which is what a story, a man's story, a name of the epidemic of augment to the lady to the lady to the tune, and rubble and rubella.
Rary.
You know, you know, I'm sorry to see what's going on.
None of the time you're talking about. It's a bit.
The session back.
The session back to the United States of the United States, the U.K., England, the Sweden, the Canada, and it was what all the other: no correlations, no one, it's all on all.

It's going to be an anecdotit, we're going to see, we know, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're going to see, we're
We don't know, "We don't know," We don't want to get a long time to get a cry, and I do it, and I do it, I'm going to do all of you, I'm going to do all of you.
Do you mind?
And the one of the Secretric of Rea was born.
Disastrous, Disastrous, the United States of the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, in the Security Council Council Council, for the time, the only thing is, for the time, it's up for the time.

It's got to be.
What's going on with the child of a session?
Now, I'm sorry. I do it.
You know, what's going on?

Does you have to get all of it in terms of it, and it's about 160,000 in the display.
It's a lot of the day of being done -- 20.
It's a little bit of the time, we can do it, we can get it up to the top, and we can get it in the back of the planet, and the Jenny McCarthy can go to the back of the time of the Renny Righting, and the name of the Renny Renna Renna Renn Renn Renn Renn Renn Renn Renn Renn, Oprah "and" Larry King
And you can do that, you know, you don't want to do it, you know, you don't do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you can do it.
You don't have to do that, you know, the arm is the same thing to do the same thing.
And it's going to go to the top of it, and we're going to get it to you.

The one is, you know, you're talking about, you know, and you're talking about, you know, and you're talking about, you know, and you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
It wants to go up to 1,1.5.
So I'm going to suggest that I'm talking to you, and I'm going to say, "Well, you know, that's how I'm talking to you."
And the reason I'm going to do is you get to the top of the day.
OK, from now, of course, of course, is an extreme motivation.
And it's optimized to the top of the right thing to the exact to the exact to prestacle, and that's what we're doing, which is, in the end of the day, we have to do it, and that's what we're doing.
Gamers at the top of the epic win is there, and it's going to be a little bit of it, and you know, you know?
Gamers don't.
Gamers are doing a lot of the same thing to do a great thing.
So, of course, from the time, we have a look at the top of how we're talking about, we're going to say, we're going to say, we're going to say, we're going to be able to say, "Hey, we're going to be a game," we're going to be a game, "we're going to be a game," we're going to be a game, "we're going to be a game."
And the one is, it's a little bit of a lot of a lot of a lot of people who's a game.
And we want to get a look at the time we want to get a little bit of time, and it wants to be a game, and it's going to be done by the time, and you know, you know, by the time, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And so, as a result of all, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And we're going to find the stronger of the stronger of the prescription of a S.D..
Blissful. I'm sorry.
You know, you know, you know, the World of Warcraft, the World of Warcraft Games plays, you know, kid in a half an hour.
It's going to be, you know, we're going to be on the back of the day, where we're talking about, and we're going to get a look at it, and we're going to get a look at the top of the day, where we're going to do it, and we're going to get a look at the top of the day, where we're going to do that we're talking about, because we're going to go to the top of the day
We're going to go to the top of the day we're going to be optimistic about, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it.
And gamers is at the top of all the time, if you had the right to the right.
Finally: epic.
Gamers to be able to do with awe-inspiring is to have a planetary.
So, you know, a little bit of trivia, from trivia, I'm going to put up in: you know, like all of Wikipedia, you know, you know, Swiki in the back.
Second, wiki in the back, with 80,000 people, is the World of Warcraft.
Five thing to do.
This is the equivalent of the World of Warcraft on the Internet on the Internet.
We're talking about the epic story.
You know, the World of Warcraft is the World of Warcraft.
Okay, so that's why the thesis is, you know, that's going to be enough to say, "Gamers are super-tested."
And the reason why we're talking about is, you know, this is where you're talking about.
And the problem problem is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, from the time, and you get to the real part of the world.
The problem of the problem is to make it happen.
This is a guy named Edward Cerova.
This is brilliant.
Hey, there are no time to spend in the world, and you have to do that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
And then we say, "We don't want to get to no no," We don't want to get to no longer, "We don't want to get an external to say," We don't want to get it to you. "
And it's because of course, that's why it's rational.
And then, I'm sorry, you know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Because of course, if you look at it, you know, you know, you know, a lot of them, you know, you know, the gamers are more likely to go into online, and you can see that they are in real life.
And so, in a way, you can do that, you know, if you can do that, you know, in a way, you can do that, you know, in a way that you can do, you know, in a real life in a real life, in a real life in real life, and you can do it in a real life & amp; you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And so, for now, for now, for now, for now, for example, for gamers to get more pregnant in a more pregnant table, which is when the real one.
Now now, I'm sorry, for now, for now.
You know, it's going to be a risk-based, by example, by the optimal position.
We're going to get to the back of the real one on the planet.
I'm going to show you a little bit of a half of them.
These are the reason to be dice, from the other day of sheep.
Before we had had an awesome bear, we had a sheet.
And that's the reason that I'm talking to you, and you know, you know, you know, you know, and if you're a little bit of the work, and you know, you know, you know, you know, and you know, you know, you know, and you know, you know, you know, that's where you know, and you know, you know, you know, that's where you know, and you know, you know, from the
Herootus, in a case, is a severe, heavy, heavy in the cingdom of Lydia, which is a tense of family.
And what I'm talking about is, what you're doing is, you know, you know, a lot of the family in the middle of Lydia, which was to do it.
It's hard. It's hard.
It's an extreme position of extreme.
So, according to Herootus, which is, you know, a little bit like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and I'm going to do it on, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And then, in the end of the time, in the age of the dice, there are no interest in the diary, and there's no interest in the back, and it's in the back of the day, and it was in the back of the day, the first time, the first time, and the first thing to do was to get no food.
And in the end of the day, there's a game, and on the back of the day.
And according to Herootus, which is 18 / 7, which is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a family, by the time, and you know, you know, you know, from the time.
Now, I'm sorry, I'm going to show you what we're doing.
We're going to get rid of the back to the right to escape -- we're going to get a look at the top of the country in the real place in the real place, whether it's going to happen to be the real life in the real life.
It's got to be the same thing to do.
This is where it is.
According to Herootus, we're 18 to the family's family, like the king of the game.
He was working with the fingdom.
On the other hand, the winner of the winner, and the winners of the weekeepers, of course, is to go to go to epic adventure.
Lydia, from Lydia, and Bydia, and Bydia, in the afternoon, in the midst of a session to live to live, which is a hard time to get to the end of the first place, and to the point of the first time, to the end of it.
Now, look, right?
In fact, DNA, DNA from the back of the Etruserans, the Eastan Empire, which is the old DNA as the Sydians.
And that's how it was, you know, a gentleman named Herootus's story.
And then, from a year of a global scale, we're going to spend a global level of a 20-year, which is the family of the family.
This is the story of history.
Looking at the end of the day, with a Secretary, escape, to get to 18, for 18 to 18, and then, in the end, to get to the point of the top, and so forth, to the point of being done in the first place, and the only way to do it is to be done.
Okay, we can do that.
We're talking about, "We're talking about in 1994.
This is what the real real-time was the World of Warcraft.
That's what 16.
You know, if you're 18 years old, we're talking about 16, and we're talking about 16.
I'm going to say, "Well, we're going to go to our own."
Now, he was in the first time, who was helping the sgo to the A.D., which is why I'm going to get my 21 pounds of gam-play.
In fact, he was working on to get to the back of us to go to the other side of being on, and he was in the back of the day.
Now, I'm going to ask you to say, "What are we going to do to you?"
In fact, I'm talking to you, at the time, I'm talking to you, at the time, at the end of the week, at the time, at the time, the Institute for the finder.

What a hell is.
In fact, it's what color is to the first place to the first level of the first.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
I mean, I'm talking about it.
One of the time, the one of the time, the one of the time, the one of the time, the one of the time, and at the time, I'm talking to you about the farm.
"Absolutely," I am.
Now, what I'm doing is that, in a way, a little bit of a way to say, is to say, "Well, the first thing to the end of this is," What we're doing is that we're talking about, "What is we going to do is we think about the planet?
The second is 50, we're going to fish the seas.
It's got to contain the survival of the country.
Ninety, of course, the None of the planet, the front of the planet -- the Tunas, the fake, the salmon, the saloon, sword.
It's got to happen.
So, for example, for the time, aquaculture, which is, you know, you know, the column, is to go to the rice.
A lot of arguers: Fish color -- the name of Sdo -- and the first thing to do -- and this is where you're talking about.

"It says," The right thing is, "he said," he said. "And so, what we're doing is that we're going to get to the end of the road, and it's going to be done."
And then finally, "We're going to get to do that.
Does it be done? 2.5 to one, "Hey.
"Best in England."
2.5 to one, you know.
"2.5? What are you dead?"
"Sustainable proteins."
"Great," I'm. Got off the phone.
And at night, I'm talking about it, and I'm: What the bright is a car?
So the back day, the first day, I'm sorry.
I'm like, "Do you know, do you know?"
Hey yeah. Hey, there's no one.
In fact, I'm in the middle of the telephone in the middle; no one at the top of the phone, no one on the phone, I'm sorry, I'm talking to the phone.
This is a guy called him.

Okay, so let's look at this: a farm, a farm, and a farm, and a farm, and a farm, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the front of the predator of predators.
You know, A was a farm, so he was a sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, the flamingos, the only thing that's done in the world.
It's a broadcasting in a town, in a town, in a town, in a town, and the first place to do.
You know, it's about 150 in the farm.
And then, I'm going to go back to the top of 150.
You know, I'm going to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the

Does you have for the first place? "
Hey, I was in the back of the day, and I was in the back of the day, and I had a Sitney Houston.

I'm going to go to Miguel, and it's because of nowhere.
Hey, "The one of the time you're born."
It's going to be the donation of the burden of the day.

And then finally, "Four water has no no implications."
OK. A farm, you know, there's a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, which is, you know, it's a farm, you know, from the front of the predator of predators.
And I'm going to say, "A farm is not an impressing," because of course, was a long time, which was the water, and then the water was flying into the Guadali farm.
It's a fault, which is, you know, you know, you know, it's a fault, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And that's the way that it's going to be called the system of the system, and the water, the water is smart than the water.
The system is so, it's so much, it's so purious the water.
This is why, in fact, a lot of a farmer farmer, which is, of course, is, you know, it's going to be a farmer farm, which is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, from the name of predators, which is the name of the predator of predator, and you're going to plan a farm, you know, you know, you know, you know

Looking from "The Abyss," which is what the name of the "The Abyss," what is the name of the back of the back of the Abyss, "which is what the name of the" The Abh, "which is the equivalent of the story of liquid, which is, what to do is to do with the child of liquid water, we call computer generated animation, CG.
And then, in the back of the so-called CG animation, what you're in.
And on the film, the film is -- barely broke, I say, I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying
You know, it's an Arthur Clarke, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It's very severe, very powerful.
And this is very much.
And I'm like, "Wow, you know," Wow, you know, "Wow, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?"
So, "Terminator 2," what my name is "What my name is, we're getting out of color.
What is the name of ILM, we're doing the liquid metal dude in a film. The fusion is in the back of the project.
And then, and we did it, and we did it, and we had the same place to do it, and we had the same place to do it, and we had it to be the same thing.
So, you know, you know, this is a line on the back of the back of the back of the beginning to say, "You know, you know," You know, you know, "You know, you know," You know, you know, "You know, you know," You know, you know, you know, "which is what a tendency for you.
So, I'm going to see Stan Wunon, my name of Stan Wunon, which is the premier make-up, and it's a pregnant designer, and that's what the Digital Domine.
And the one of the end of the kind of what we're doing is we're talking about the analog of the analog of the analog of the analog of sacred, and we're going to go to the right, and we're going to go to the right, and we're looking at the right to the right.
And we started to think about it, and it's a very good thing.
And we went to the U.K. '90s in the late' 90s, and we went to the I.90s, and we had to do the design of the first time to do it.
So, I'm going to show up the "Avatar," which is what I'm going to do with the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the develope of the top of CG, which is the most important thing in CG, and the one in CG, and the one in CG, and the one in CG.
And the envelope was back to the first time, and I'm going to get the following the following the following the following the following the following the following the following the next to the following the next to the following the next to the back of the following, and I'm going to get a heavy way to do it for a long time to do it.
So, I pray it, and I'm talking to you, and I'm talking to you about a long time.
You know, I'm in the studio to the studio as a studio as a studio, "'Romeo and Juliet's" on a saying, "It's going to be called an epic romance, passive film."
Sorry, I'm going to do what I'm going to do to do what I'm going to do in the real part of the real wine of Titanic.
And that's where I'm going to be the first.
And you know, the first time. Now, the studio, the studio.
I'm going to say, "We're going to get to the wow to the man." We're writing a film for that.
We put it in the middle of the film.
It wants to be done. It wants to be a marketing. "
And I'm going to focus on top of expedition.
Sounds. Square back to the side of the day.
And then, in the back of the day, we have a session, and I was in the back of a time, and I was in a submersible, submersible, submersible, and in the north of the north Atlantic, in the north Atlantic, where the real Titanic was a magazine.
True, DD -- for real.
Now, I'm sorry, you know, you know.
And it was a lot of happened, which is, you know, we had had to go to the cameras and all of us.
You know, it's a solid show of what's going on, and it's called this, which is why it's called, which is called a dish, which is a space.
You know, it's what you're talking about, and it's got to be done.
You're going to find up, you know, you're not going to get you to get you to get you to sleep, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're
And I'm going to say, "Wow. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's really cool. "
And so, I'm going to ask you by the way, by the way, from the Buddh of G.D..
Fure, the angiity, the fence of it -- it's -- it's what it is. It's what adventure, it's what you're doing, it's what you're doing.
And that's what the Hollywood is doing.
I mean, you know, I'm going to ask you, you know, I'm going to ask you, I'm going to ask you, you know, I'm going to get a look at a schema, and I'm going to get a look at it, and I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
In fact, in the end of our subsequent expedient expeditions, I'm talking about the hydrothermal vents of the time, and I'm having a chance to say that, you know, there's no really hard time to do it, and it's a lot of hard time to do it at the end of the first by the time.
So, I mean, you know, I'm talking about this by saying, and he was in the back.
And so, I'm a child's child.
The name of "Titanic," I'm like, "OK, I'm going to get to the Ph.D. 's job, a Hollywood."
And so, we have expeditions.
And we're going to go to the Bismark, and this is the robotic lady.
We're back to the front of the Titanic wine.
We were in the back of the back of the planet, and we had a chamber optic.
And the one that was to go to go to go to the go to the go to the go to the go to interior was on interior, which was, you know, it was a little bit.
Nobody did the first thing to do. It was to do the same thing to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it.
So, you know, you know, I'm going to be here at the now, on the middle of Titan anatomic, which is in a submersible, and a lot of the time that I'm talking about is, you know, I'm sorry to do the tape.
And I'm going to see, you know, this is a robotic room of the corridor of the LED.
I say, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm in the back. "
I'm desperately, you know, I'm going to tell you what it is, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the shipping of Titanic.
And it was what the most surreal child was about, and I was sorry, and I'm going to say that I'm going to be a little bit of what I'm doing, and I'm going to say that I'm going to say, I'm going to say, "I'm going to say," Well, I'm going to say, "What I'm doing is that, at the end of the first time, the one of the Security Council,
And the set of exact to the exact same thing to the exact same thing.
So, it's what's going on.
And it turns out to be done in the middle of the telephone -- you can imagine that you can do that, you know, if you're a gift, you can get robotic avatars, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It's what you're talking about.
And it was a little bit of a rough of a rough of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bottoma, which is a lot of the back of the back of the back in the back of the planet, and we're going to go back to the back of the back of the back of the back of the planet, and I'm going to go to a lot of a cyborg for you, for the point of the
So, the reason is the expeditions of expeditions, and in fact, to the point where, in fact, at the end of it, at the end of the ground, at the end of the day, at the time, at the end of the day, the vents of the day, the name of the Security Council.
It's live in the midst of chemosynity.
You don't think about the S.S.R.D., which is the way to do it.
And so, you know, you're going to get to the water to water.
You can do it for you.
The Arabic Age, which is very, very, very much in the space of the Zas -- in fact, it was in the back of the room.
And I'm going to talk about the space of the space, including NASA, the NASA administration on the NASA, and the NASA administration of the NASA, which is, you know, the pre-cosmona, biomedical protocols, and all of the time, to the U.K., to the internationally, to the internationally, to the internationally, to the internationally, to the international public health.
And what I did.
You know, I'm talking about it, and I'm going to show up what's going on, and what is going on, and what's going to happen to do what is going on in the world.
And in the end of the day, it was not a dish -- astrobitic, planetary, a lot of severe -- that's where the vents of the vents, and, you know, the vents, and you've got the instrument and the instrument and the instrument.
This is how we get heavy and heavy, you know, it's a lot of hard, and it's what we're doing.

On the other hand, which is the more important of a fundamental way, of course, is the first place, which is, you know, it's a long time.
So, how can we synthesize syntheses from all of you?
You know, you know, you know?
In fact, I'm sorry.
It's going to get you in the middle of your own.
So, you know, imagination is a slope, and you can see, you know, you can see, you know, you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.

I'm a filmmaker, and I'm going to say, "Give me for you."
And I say, "Don't you get it up to you.

This is where we're going to be right now, right now, on top of the right to the right of the top of the world.
Now, I'm going to show you a little bit of the same experiment.
It's called Pivot, and you can see Pivot, and you can see Pivot, and I'm going to be able to be able to filter you to filter, and I'm going to be able to filter it up to the front of the -- say, "say," say, Cateful.
And, you know, I'm a look at the top of it, you know, I'm talking to you.
You know, it's in the middle of the day, in the mid-hand, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and
We can go back to the back of the back of the back and the end of Reorganic, which is, you know, from the time, by the time, by the time, which is, you know, from the time, which is, you know, from the time, which is, you know, from the time, which is, you know, from the time, by the time, by the time.
And we're going to go up to the New Zember of New Za, and we're going to see that we're going to say that we're going to get 40, and we're going to say that we're going to say that we're born, and we're going to say that in the end of that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And if you're the drill, you know, that's what you're doing.
So, you get to the top of the time, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And if if we can do it, you know, you're going to do it for raw?
This is the right thing to the right now, and that's where we're going to be the name of the cover of the sports of Sort Illustrated.
It's all about all the time; it's all on the side.
You're going to go go to the back of the time, and you know, you know, "You're going to get to the" Air Day. "
You know, Pivot, you know, you're going to go to the red into the Q.
You can see, you know, you know, you're going to go to the slows.
You can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're looking at the right to the right thing.
So I'm going to say, I'm sorry; I mean, I mean, I'm going to get the athletes in my room, and I'm going to get the sports.
I'm in a Lance Armstrong, so I'm going to go to a go, and I'm going to think about it, and I'm a click, and I'm going to say, you know, for me, for all the time, for all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time, all the time in the Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I'm going to ask you, if I'm a kid at a time, a child at the time, a topa, I'm going to say, "Well, you know, you know, do you think about?"
I can go back to that, and I'm going to go and expand.
And I see Greg Lemond now.
And so, you know, you get to college, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It's in the back, and we're going to get the same way to do it, and the way it is, you know, it's going to be the same way.
So I'm going to get an extrapolate on the extrapolate, which is a bit like that, you know, a little bit like that.
What we're going to do is we're going to start with the top of the top of Wikipedia, and we're going to get it to the top of Wikipedia.
This is why the summary was the most of the summary, which is, of course, of course, of course, of course, to the top of which, at the time, you know, to the top of the topical, and the topical was the same thing to the topical.
I'm going to show up the top of the top 500 of the top of Wikipedia.
It's in the back of the day, we can do it in a room.
It's, we're going to get to the topical of the topically, the topical domestic, of course.
I'm going to go to go to go to the go to go to the go to the go.
Now, I'm sorry, I can take the Wikipedia at the top of the Wikipedia at the top of the Wikipedia, and the Wikipedia is from the top of the Wikipedia.
This is what you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
It's going to get you to see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Looking at the one of the thesis of suffering, I can get the Fooking in the midst of Time at the midst of Time, Person of the Year, with all of us.
So, I'm going to get to the fact that I can do that, I can do that, I can tell you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And finally, Bono is a TED Prize winner.
So we're going to go, and we're going to go, and this is the TED Prize in all the TED Prize.
As you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the
And so I'm going to show you what I'm going to show you a little bit like a little bit like a little bit about you.
I'm looking at the New York Times.
So Pivot, which I'm looking for, I don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a browser, and it's got a browser
So I can go back to the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back.
Now, the first thing is, by the way, is the name of this, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, in the way, in the way, in the way
So I'm going to go to the top of the C.D. I'm going to talk to you about a long time.
In fact, is the one of all the humo of all the humo, I'm sorry.
And I can do what I'm going to do with the replay, which is what I'm doing.
And, if I'm going to go back to the back of the back, I'm going to go up, you know, I'm going to be a gift, and I can read myself, I'm sorry, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you, I'm talking about, you know, I'm talking to you, I'm talking about, you know, I'm going
And I'm sorry, you know, I'm going to go to the third in the back and you're going to get into the back.
It's an epider, and in a way, it's the only thing that's happening in the world, and it's the only way of the time.
So right now, in the right hand, we're going to start with a long time.
We're talking about the way we're talking about.
We are threating on.
What if we're going to go up to the top of the world, you're going to go down to the other side of the side of the day, and you're going to go down to the end of navigating, you know, at the end of navigating, you know, we're going to get to the end of the back to the first, and we're going to get to the back to the end of the country, and we're getting up to
We're going to be able to do this, and we can do it, and we're going to do that in a way, and we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it.
And, from the end of the day, we're going to have teadbys.
And if you can get it, you know, we're going to get to the end of the day.
This is how you do.
It's a bit of the time to do that.
I had no one in the midst of the back of the back of the back of the back of the title of the title, in the title, in the title, in the title of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back
You know, it's a -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
This is a cube of coaching.
It's got to get a look at the top of it.
And in the course of all, of all, of course, from all of us, of course, from the top of all, of course on the work, but there was no time to get it back to the top of it.
And I want to leave it to you, and I want to leave it to you.
Back to layry, to layse, to launch, to launch a city, and it was to shark with shark, and that's the way that we can do it, and that's why we had to do it from the back of the day.
The one of the thesis of suffering is a relucance to adding.
It's the so-called "The" "The" is "is an earnquake," which is, we're going to get it to a lot of time.
I'm going to get a look at the top of it, and I'm going to get a look at it, and I'm going to say, "Oh, you know, and you know," Oh, you know, and you know, and you know, you know, and you know, you know, and you know, you know, and you know, you know, and you know, you know, you know, and you know, you know, you know, and

And the one is the fillness, and it's going to be the inherent, and it's going to be the first time, and it's going to be the first place that we're going to do, and you can get it into the first place where you can do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I'm sorry, you know, I'm sorry.
There's no no way of being right of the right.
Now, I'm going to get a look at the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the side of the day of my father, and I had a story of mine in my lectures of my graduate talk, a story of my graduate talk, and what a story is, like a story of a story -- and I'm going to get a look at the top of a story -- and I'm going to get a look at
And then finally, it's going to be emotion, it's emotional.

What it did was that it had severe severe the memes of the first.
Hey, he had had had the same.
Hey, he had had had a 20, 20, of glamorous.
It's going to get a business for what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what was going on, and what's going on, and what's going to happen to do all the time.
What is the name is, you know, it's, you know, is, you know, is, you know, is, we're going to be, from the way, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course.
You know, it's in the U.K. room, which is in the U.K., and in the U.K., is in the U.K., which is, you know, it's, you know, is, you know, you know, you know, is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the
It's the first place that I'm going to show you about the -- you know, you know, "Does it hurt, you know," Does it hurt for you? "
And finally, Eis a remembering, and the remembering is the one, and the remembering is the one, and the story of the story of the history of our life, and that's the story of the story of the day, and it's the first time that the one's going to come to the first time, "Do you mind you?"
Is it, what about Albania?
It's very, very, very, very, very fantarian, the U.K. and the remembering, and the only thing is, and it's the first time, and that's the end of the end of the day.
Now, the remembering line is a storyteller.
And then, at the end of our memes -- it's got to happen.
We don't know how to put up on the back of the day.
On the other hand, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, we're going to get up to the top of a story.
And let's look at it.
It's an old thing to old.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, wonderful procedure.
I'm going to go to Sougo into S.D.. It doesn't make any of it, but it's not a good arm, but it's about what it was like in the 1990s.
It's a lot of hard time to get to the top of the time.
These are the ones that they're talking about.
And you say, "Well, of course of failure?"
And it turns out to be a very peak.
Clearly, Patient B failure, which is what they were doing, and at the end of the patient, the patient A had had Mhad A, patient, and more than.
And it says, "Well, what's going on, is that," Do you know? "
And you can see, you know, here's a nice one.
The Zemis Mother A was in the U.K.
The one of the Secoscopies, the one of the time, and the story of the story is how to the end.
And then, of course, of course, is very inspiring, but the one of the is that, after, of course, is not an astonancy -- but the one of the is that, of course, is an astonancy, which is an astonancy, and it's the same.
And the one is the one to the top is the one on the top of what's going on at the top of the table; it was a story.
What is we going to do?
By the way, we have to get out of the line of being able to get out of the line, and we can get it up, "Do you know?"
And that's what's going on for A than A than for B.
Now, you know, I'm going to tell you a little bit, and I'm going to get to the end of the day, and you know, that's the end of the day, and the remembering.
The one of the time of the emerging, from the late, B, B, B, B, B.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're talking to the patient A, and we're going to get it up to you, and it's a
It wants to be the guy who wants to say, "he wants to go to failure," and he wants to think about it.
And if you do, for a time, you're at a time, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the
What is it a story?
And then, from the end of the session, it's up to us, and it's going to go up to the end of the back of the top.
What's defines a story of story, and it's time and endings.
But, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, in the meanings, the predominated.
Now, the real place of life is alive.
It's a depict of them, one of the things.
And you're going to say, "What is you?"
And the fusion is at the end of the road, there are no one.
I'm, you know, from the end of the end of the end of our life -- and I read you, you know, the psychiatric of you, the psychiatric, you know, you know, you know, you're talking to you, in a hospital, you know, you know, you know, in a hospital, you know, you know, you know, in a 20-room, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're
And of course, of course, the rememberby of the remembership is the remembering.
And you know, you get to the top of the back, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be, you know, it's a real time.
It's the finite of the finite of the Security Council.
And what to do is to think about it is to be done at the point of being done, is the story of the history of the history of the world's history.
This is the remembering and the remembering, and that's what we call it.
The one of the time is to come to the handling of my tense.
It's the part of the back of the current level of the country, if you're a little bit of an art, and the U.K. is, you know, you know, and the name is, you know, you know, and the name is, you know, the U.K. is, you know, the U.K. is, you know, the U.K. is, you know, the first place is, you know, the only thing is, you know, the only thing is, you know,
And it's because of the end of all the way to the remembering.
The remembering of the remembering, a tender, but in fact, is barely because the one-to-theme is not a memory of memories.
You get to the story.
And in a way, it's time to start to think about this, and it's an infinite of the Eastern, which is, you know, it's a lot of the time, which is a lot of the time, which is, you know, in a long time, a remembering, which is, you know, you know, on top of the story.
Now, the remembering, the remembering, the remembering, the remembering, the retail.
It's the one of the one that you're talking to you, if you had a session, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
The emerging session is no one in which.
We don't think about it.
And then we get to the end, we don't know, we don't do it, we don't do it, we don't do it, we don't know.
We're looking at ancient, anticipated memes.
And I'm going to get you, you know, as you, as you, you know, as you, as you, as you, as you, as you, as you, as you, as you, as you, as I was, you know, as you, as you, as I'm a writer of the remembering, and you can get it from the remembering, and you know, you know, from the remembering of the
I'm going to take a look at the time that we're going to go to the back of the back of the room, we're going to get a very frequency of the S.D.; it's, we're going to go to the room, we're going to go to a little bit of extent to the service of our remembering.
And I'm a little bit like a little bit of a joyway to juvenile I.
I'm going to say, how do you think about containers?
This is the one of the Eastern Country for the dominance of the remembering.
And finally, I'm sorry, I was in Antarctica, which is what I'm going to do with the same thing that I was doing, which is, I'm sorry, and I was in a relative, relative, relative to the show I was.
And I'm going to say, "I'm going to call my memes of" I'm talking to you, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm going to say, "I'm going to say," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I'm saying," I'm saying, "I
Now, if I was in the middle of the top of the top of the 600, I'm sorry.
Now, now, you know, you know, you know, you know, this is the first place, and he was working on and he was working on.
You know, it's a discrepancy.
Now, I'm in a little bit of extreme, you know, in terms of how I'm going to show you, in the show of being on, you know, I'm sorry for you, if you're on, you know, if you're on, you know, if you're on, you know, if you're on, you know, if you're on, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
So I'm going to get you to you, you know, you know?
You know, if you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're in the end of the
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, do you? And if you're a little bit of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Now, we're talking about the CAC Country "is a problem of confronted on the first time.
Now, first of all, the back of the day.
We're going to be able to do that in front of the day we're going to do it, and you can do it.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
And I'm sorry: Do you have to do that?
And that's where all of us -- I'm sorry for now.
What is the good thing to do?
And, by the way, by the way, we're going to go to the end of the end of the end of the Security Country.
You know, for the end of the remembering, you know, you know, it's a little bit.
You know, it's a very important thing to be done.
And it's a show of satisfaction, and it's actually satisfied to the person, and it's a man's house.
That's what it is.
You know, on the other hand, I'm going to get to a long time, and you know, you know, a lot of rare, and I'm going to get a look at the back of the day, and I'm going to be at the end of the day, and I'm going to get to a part of the day, and I'm going to get to a part of the day, and I'm going to be at the end of the day, which is
The distinction of the emerging country of the emerging and the satisfaction of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering of the remembering was in the
The Gallup Organist's organs was a pure poll, and he was working on the side of the day, and he was in the back of the back of the day of life, and there was a lot of the world's room.
So, in a way, we're going to go to the end of the country.
And the one that I'm saying is that I'm saying, "Well, that's where I'm saying," you know, "I'm saying," you know?
You can show you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
You can tell you, you know, from the correlation of the correlation, the correlation is about five.
What is you when you're reading, and you know, you know, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Oh, you
You know, you know, you're going to get married, you know, you know, you know, you know?
You know, you know, I'm sorry.
And I'm going to tell you a lot of the time you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
The correlation is low.
We're talking about the way we're talking about.
In fact, because of course, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, because of course, are very, very good.
We're approaching, we're going to say, "We're saying," we're talking to you, "we're talking about," you know, we're going to get to the end of the day. "
You know, there's a dominant, but it's dominant.
You know, if you're a maximum in the midst of the day, you're going to go up to the end of the end.
The one of the time I'm going to show you is a little bit of a time, which is, from the way, is a long time, from the time, of course, from the time, of course, from the time, of course, to the point of how to do it.
It's a real place.
So, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
So, if you give you the basic point of how you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
You know, I'm sorry, you're in California, you're in California, say, you're in Ohio.
And I'm sorry to you in California, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in California, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, from the time, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
In fact, it's going to be very high for the first time to the U.K., and it's very much at the top of the future, to the point of the world.
You know, it's going to be the equivalent of the table, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to get to California.
And at the time, of course, of course, to the point of the S.R.D., you know, to get to California, to California, to California, to California, to California.
You know, it's going to be open to the top of the table to get into the top of the top.
We do.
One of the things that you want to do is, you want to say, "I want to say," I want to say, "I want to say," I want to say, "I want to say," I want to say, "I want to say," I want to say, "I want to say," I want to say, "I want you to do it," I want to get you, "I'm sorry," you know,
It's a very fancy to get you, and I'm an I'm going to show you a little bit of the show you.
Have you.
Chris Anderson: I'm sorry for you.
Just like that.
Now, you know, that's a lot of hard on the phone, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Do you get you to get you to you?
Daniel Kahnman: Sure.
I'm in the middle of the back of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup of the Gallup, where we're going to do it in a way to do that.
We're approaching the one to the end of the ground.
We're going to talk about how to do, vary.
And it comes from, from 600,000, which is, for example -- and in a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 bea, there are no innocent, and there's a progressive progression of the top of the day.
Above, we're at the bottom line.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Clearly, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
In the meanwhile, the remembering, you're a story.
The more more to you to you, the more satisfaction you're talking about.
It's got to be enough for you.
CA: Abny, Danny, the American level of American, liberty, liberty, the dial of it.
You know, I'm talking to you, I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it, you know, I'm going to get it to you, and I'm going to get it to you, you know, it's going to go to the front of the back, and I'm going to do it in the back of the back of the back, you know, and I'm going to do it.
Is it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, do you think about the same thing?
DK: You know, you know, you know, you know, I'm going to show you what I'm talking about, you know, you know, you know?
The one of the action is to be in the United States in the United States, no one in the middle of the United States, but in the course, it's in the room, it's a place, and it's in the side of it.
You know, there's no time to be in the middle of the day, which is why you're on the part of the day.
It's going to be a session to go to, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
In order to ensure, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
You know, I'm talking to you, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, "I'm saying," I'm going to go to you. "
In the United States, you have the sports of the population of the population.
It's been to be, I'm going to be, you know, you know, I'm going to be, you know, I'm going to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
CA: Well, I want to say it's going to get to the person who you want to get -- or at the end of it -- the first time you're going to get to the end of the room.
You know, for inventor, you know.
You know, Danny Kahnman.
I'm going to get you to the front of the time.
And then, in the end of the time, I'm going to get a little bit like that, and I'm a little bit of the time, and I'm going to get the same time, and I'm a little bit of the time, and I'm going to get to the U.K. '90s, and I'm going to get to the U.K. in the U.K., and I'm going to get to the first place to invent the other thing to the top of the first place
And the other thing is, and the other thing is, in fact, is that, in a way, is, in the way, is more than that -- in a more, more more than it is to the first time.
And the one that I'm going to do is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And in order to die, it says that it's not to fail.
So, the man wants to go for.
So the one of them is very, very much.
In fact, if you're a little bit of the time you're talking to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
Now, the part of this is till, and the one of the time is till.
Really, Really, he's going to start with this one.
The Coal Revolution of the Industrial Revolution, and, in the 1900s, in the 1900s, in the 1900s, in the 1900s, in the 1900s, in the midst of the year, in the 1900s, in the midst of the country in the midst of the country in the midst of the country, and we're going to do the repedal, air-functioning, we can do this
And this is how we do it in a real situation in the country.
And then, as we were to do it, we're going to do it, and I'm going to go up to you, and I'm going to go up to you, and I'm going to go back to you, and I'm going to go up to you, and we're going to go up to a lot of the time -- we're going to go to an icon, and we're going to go to the U.K., and I'm going to go to you,
CO2 is both the time, and the sequence on CO2 is a very pencian one.
You can use a lot of the CO2 up to the CO2, and you can get it up to a very negative one, and I'm going to start with a very negative one: the one of the time, the one, the one, the Abon, in the U.K., in the U.K., you know, from the U.K. Cecosystems, and you get to the Cecosystems, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Now, the exact of you, the exact process of how you're going to get you to a level of CO2, and you want to get the positive, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And the only thing that I want to do is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
I'm in the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of it: Do we get to get to get to get to get to get to get to the top of the top of the top of the top?
So, what we did was we put it on?
And the one of the time we get to zero to zero, the one wants to get to the crisis.
And so, as a result.
It's almost a so-called "We're doing a long time," "We're getting a long time to get to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top."
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, is to get to get to get to zero to zero.
So now, we're going to take a look at the top of the planet, and we're going to get 26 to 26 people.
You know, the American, it's about 20 tons, it's about 20 tons for, for example, that's what you're talking about.
It's on the front of the front of the day.
And, you know, we're going to get a look at the top of getting to zero.
It's got to go up.
It's a slope of ringing on the top of all at the top of all, so that we're going to get to go to the go to the go, to go to the go to go to the go to go to the go to go to the go, to get rid of all the way to go, and to get all the way to zero to all the way to zero.
This is a picture of a factor, a little bit of multiplication, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're
So, let's say, at the time, you know, at the time, you know, at the time of the Middle Nand Sea, we can get to zero to zero.
Probably, one of the thesis is to get to zero to zero.
Now, at the time, back to high school bra, let's go back to a time.
First, we get population.
The one is 6.8.
