Several officer, at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow.
And the very pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple: teams of the Middle At the test standing up the talling of the test, you know, like the talling of 20 sticks of spaghetti, and one yard of tape, one yard of Sting and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow hand is to be.
And, in fact, it's a simple thing, and it's hard to pretty much definitely whether it's a little bit of collaborative on collaborate.
And so I think about what was going on, and I incorporated it into a design shop.
And so what a huge is looking for.
And then, you know, I'm spending 70 designs in 70 design, and I designed and designers and architects, the CTOs of the Fortune's 50, and the CEO of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortun@@
So, normally, it's taken by orienting themselves in the world.
First of all, characteristics out of the way they look at it.
There's a way to start planning, organizing organizing, sketch on the spaghetti.
This is the majority of the majority of chembling the sticks into ever-sized.
And then finally, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, like, you know, outside the marshmallow, and it turns out to be like, and it turns out, and it stood up, and it was on, and it was a day.
On the heart of the day, it's called the "tye" and "Tuh-oh" -- "The Byo Oh," "The Bourt of the marshmallow circle of the marshmallow" collapse. "
So, as you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, a lot of stuff like that, you know, it's a lot of "uh-oh" moment, and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates.
OK, so, you know, you know, cheat, the map of districted and so forth.
And of course, of course, technically teams of people who are going on, and it's like, "tac-da" worth, and among the absolutely recent graduate.
And it was amazing.
At Peter tells us, perhaps, you know, you know, you know, you know, that's what the tall-way is the absolute thing, you know, the whole thing's environment is all about this.
So the bottom line: is that? Why? What is it?
And Peter liffs to say, you know, none of the Middle Effoner, the CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
It's not a little bit of jucky power.
It's a very good job.
And the reason is a business of business students are going to be trained to the sound right now, right?
And the execute on it.
And the way is, it's the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top, and it's a little bit out of it.
It was a crisis.
Right? Right.
What major do differentiate is called the marshmallow, and a sharing prototype, successive prototype, checing the marshmallow, white multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way.
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project.
And then, rather version, they get strong feedback, and that's what they do.
So the thing in prototyping with a prototype is essential, and let's take a look at what's going on.
So the average for the average is, you know, in the average, by 20 inches -- business schools, a half of them; lawyer, a purpose, you know, instead of being, you know, a downtown, kinderer, thickled, evidence.
Who does this matter?
Architect and engineer, thanky.
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world.
And so on, you know, it's going to be the potential and self-cleanly geetetrical powered geetrical patterns in the world.
So CEOs, a piece of that CEOs, a little bit of an average, and it's coming up with that.
You put you on executive adminances on the team, the significantly.
It's called you. You know, you're going to go, you go, you go, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Win the way."
You can be conscious. You can get it.
It's a little bit of skills of divertation.
Sometimes the project is the project.
And whatever, you know, team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team.
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong.
You know, you're having typically performance, you know, you're going to be able to get you, you know, it's a matter of being able to do it, you know, it's a thing that you're doing, you know, it's the way that you have, you know, it's the way that you see, you know, it's the way that you're doing.
And I tried.
I do, let's go once.
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning.
So, how do you know, how do you get to be done with that, and design is design?
What about the world?
And he said, "No one team had had a standing in a standing.
Now, anyone had a piece of sharing, say, "On one in the middle of the world, the price of the brain.
Like, isn't it? However stacking, staces, staces, stacks impact.
We arrived at the exercise on the exercise.
What do you do?
This is the wealth of prototyping.
So this is the bottom of the very, very much, the very way to do the same thing about the stuff.
At the tallest, the tallest in the least, the test of the brain.
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a marshmallow, you know, you're having a marshmallow?
And the reason is, I'm making a process of processing tools and processing processing the cars of taking video and it's a visual effects.
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day.
Frankly, frankly, it project has marshmallow, right?
The challenge provides provides a shared, and a slide on a long time, a sustainable, a little bit of a pole on the right.
And so, you know, the value of the Central of the City of the exercise.
And it's like you're going to be able to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It's a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of your marshmallows.
Finally step-by-step-by-and-by-step.
You know, it's a little bit of crazy fuzy, you know, it's the kind of thing that's going to be like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be an advertising system.
You know, there's an autonomous type of people who are there.
And the fundamental lesson, I think, is a design, design is a contact.
It demanded the way we bring all of our head to the top, and it goes up the very all of our own, our fellow, our fellow and our case to the challenge.
And, you know, a prototype of Earth's prototype, you know, it's all the way to turn it into a two-oh type of moment to a nuh-oh.
And that's a little bit differently.
All right.
Let's be predenting right now.
A more machine, a cool, TEDish machine, and it machine, it machine.
And you put it in the way to get it into it.
And you can go, you can go on, you can go forward, you can't have you yourself.
And I wonder, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was boreful, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and
I don't know, I'm going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to be a Twitter, or Twitter, "American Idol."
I don't know.
I was convinced with nonviolent, of pull to nostalgia, to knowing you.
And I do.
I mean, I said, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say."
I don't have to go to go back, and it's called an adventurous way.
It's offering the possibilities of being planet to be planet, and it's called the Congo, Congo.
As I do to get it in the machine, and I graduated from Gochine.
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the case, and it's based on a planet, and it's based on it, and it's basically choose to choose, and Walth, mobility, audience, declining rates of disease...
It was a matter of mind.
My great-graded participation, all of the story, by the time, by 60.
My grandparents pushed 70.
My participation of my participants are wrong in 80.
This is how the beginning of my death was the beginning of my death.
After all, it's a bigger, and it's a bigger deal.
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi, excited to live Earth's lichest in the world, in the middle 100, you're born.
Think, you know, it's going to be done.
And does it happen?
Smallpox. Smallpox killed a billion-billion-plan.
It reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way.
It's called it. It's a Dvanished.
We vanquish it. Puff.
For example, in the same time, threatened millions of us there is no longer, hardly.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio...
Do you see anyone else?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to be fed billions of stuff, the Tentific of the Center method.
And to my mind, the Cententific method -- stuff out out, searched if it works, it changed off, is one of the God of the Saccomplishm of humanity.
That's the way we look at it.
Infortunately, it's all the way news, and it's a little bit problems, and it turns out to be the same thing.
And one of it is that all our accomplished all our accomplishments, a trillion of goes to the bed hungry to get hungry.
You know, it's called the rising, and it's a very rapidly sharing, and it's very rapidly, and it's going to be discovery.
And then, you know, that's where our imagination to the thoroughly thoroughly drash.
Potal water, Arabland, rainforests, oil, gas, it's like, you know, it's in the middle of it, and it's in the middle of it, and innovate and innovate, innovate in the way out, you know.
So the thing is, Can we do? And I can do it.
I mean it was clear to be able to do it, I want to get food, it wants to be a little bit billion of the Earth, and it goes into the country, and it's listening to the country.
I like to do that, the destroy of power, destroy.
I do it, and I don't know it's going to be in the way in the way.
Every one of the Earth keeps coming up with the top of the Earth keeps up, and one of the Earth keeps going up with night: We're going to be progress in Conence more than that right now.
And so, you know, it's going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can.
We have the verge of amazing, and yet I've gone to go to go to go to go back to go, 300 people, the Enlightenment, to the British Age Age Age Congress, who was going to be a little bit of the progress, and we went to find a little bit of limb, and it would be like a front of front
Peating wrap is very popular, and so you know, the thing that you can do is, you know, the uglish you can.
On the audience wants to go.
And, listening, contemplated with their opinion, the Contled population of being progressed.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
You knew entirely on your own. Sorry, you know.
And I'm going to be a huge amount of neighborhoods.
There's a story, I wrote a story, Vaccine for The New Yorker.
And I think it's a popular opposition: the opposition to it is, it's all, the Con-effective public, and it's called measure.
I do to do it, I do, like, I wrote, I wrote, I wrote, and I was a mobile.
And so, I wrote a story, I wrote a story.
Same one, more bigger.
Pew's crazy.
So I wrote a story about this story, and I was puzzling yourself, and the Frankenfoods, which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark, rather than a haphazard way, which puzzling itself, which puzzling itself.
You know, you're doing it, I do. I wrote the story, I was mobion.
I have a journalist.
We type, we're falling, we're going to dinner. It was dead.
And thankfully, thanthfully, I was born on, and I couldn't do some people out there, and eventually I do.
And in the middle of God, Brizy anatics are going to be going to be fantatically going to happen in the world.
Same amazing thoughful, educated equipment.
It's going to be exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same.
And it's going to be a little bit of it.
As I do, you know, you're honest.
We ended up in the middle of Earth, and we don't know, in the car, the relationship of relationship in the world.
We do it ambivalding.
We do it in ironic terms, "Congress."
Okay, I think that's what's going on for you, and I'm going to be able to think about it.
We're going to read faith in an institutional, in authority, and in terms of it, and you know, there's an idea of it, and there's no idea that we shouldn't go.
You can say, "You can say," and you want to be able to do it.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass deeply, hanging.
You can do you can do you can get your choose.
Now, it's the purpose of all the way in the world, and it's a little bit of a problem, and it's a little bit of skepp.
Ask: For example, demand is the request.
Don't do anything.
So here, you get it all the way: you're going to get a little bit, you know, you're going to get your acceptance on account.
And the reason I can say, the idea is that, in an epidemic of the epidemic of fear, you know, you're in the epidemic of an image, and you're in the middle of the Earth.
About 12, which is a story that was published, a horrible story, a horrible story, the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Ton of the study that we're looking at is that what's true.
For example, tons of study like this, it's serious issues.
All the way.
The bottom of the United States is called the United States, in England, Sweden, Canada, and what all the things are: no correlation, no one, none at all.
It's called it. It's a matter of charge, and it's called the anecdotes, we think it's the way we look at seeing it, and we're in the middle of the sea, and we're in the middle of the sea, you know, it's the real thing.
We don't have a bunch of documents, and we have a government officially, and I do, I said I was doing all the things.
You know?
The results of it is an amazing thing.
Disastrous: The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs in the world's vaccine rate for measles.
It's discovery, and it's an ashamed of it.
It was horrible.
What about a child of a child?
Now now, I do. I do it.
Do you see, you know, there's some kind of maps of maps?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles?
There are very much.
Again, they're going to be done in this, but it's going to be like 160,000 in the water.
A lot of death of measles -- 20.
For example, it's going to be done, and we can put it out of our minds, and you know, Jenny McCarthy can be preaching McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy, and
And the thing you can do is, you know, it's going to be able to get out of this, and it's going to be like this, and correlation.
It's not very much, though, that's the bottom of the bottom.
And it goes back to that.
It's a little while, Jonas Salk.
Heap of the world's source of some of the stuff.
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.
It's a bad guy in the middle, which is how much.
His name is Paul Offit.
Hey hey, a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff.
It's called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning.
Pretty, right?
Actually, Paul Paul goes to the Raul, you know, you know, you know, you know, I'm going to get vaccine, and I think of it as valuable, and you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like this.
Here's how it goes.
So, Paul's Ana terrorist.
And Paul Saul Saudi Paul was in a public, he's going to go to the Council of Earth.
However, he asked him to go, and he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, and he remembered him, and he remembered him.
And hold, Do Paul was vaccine.
I don't know, I don't say, say, vaccines are essential.
You see, you know, you have a disease, you know, horrible discussion.
We human measles in the world.
And it turns out that, and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtually of that, and it's going to be done by that, and it's going to be a squid.
And you know, that's what the of measles are.
What does polio? Let's go on. Why?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks, and it's like, I know, I do something.
There's no one.
She switched into the vaccine, you know, a polio, no way.
Fine.
Why? Let's go on polio.
We're going to be the polio in the hyesterday.
Today, I don't know, you know, this guy is, you know, a guy in Lagos in Lagos in Lagos, and he's going to go to LAX, right now.
And go up to a couple of hours in a couple of couple of hours, there's a car running a car, and then go to Long Beach, and it's going to be a very fabulous TED dinner.
And then, you know, it's going to be a paralytic disease, and we're going to be paralytic disease, and we don't have anything else in the bottom of the bottom of it.
And the planet is the planet on the planet. There's a pretty predent about it.
Now, you know, well, in the way, you know, we're going to go on to do it. We do to do it.
You know, Everyone's vitamins in the morning?
Echinacea, a type of antioxidant to get you.
I'm going to do you a half of American.
Now, the stuff of the stuff, and it's called the stuff of alternative medicine, and as a result of it, as a result of them, how many times we look at the top of it.
This is all the material.
By the way, you know, it's going to be an altitude thing.
It's like, you know, you're a little billion dollars in pay 28 billion dollars in it?
I am doing you.
Right. Dark.
Why do we do? Why do we do?
For example, I was there, I was having a big charma.
We have characteristics. We don't know.
And we shouldn't go and look at the care of the stuff.
It's a cruel millions of millions.
It was absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-lying to the movement of it.
So that's where it's like, and so forth do?
We run into the arm of Big Placebo.
It was fantastic. I do Big Placebo.
You know, you do it, you know, it's a serious one, and it's a crap, and you're billions of dollars on it.
And I heard all sorts of things like this.
No of it -- gindgo, fraud; echinacea, frow; I don't have to have a case of mind, and it's a billionth of dollars on dollars on dollars on dollars on it -- it's a fraud.
And you're talking? At you? At you, I say, you know, I'm going to ask you, and I say, "What do you do? Let's do things like this.
It does. "
You know? You're wrong.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if it was the size of the outside of HHS, "Hmm, I found myself on the Siddle the Side of my expert on my experts on my right," or simply, you know, scanctics quack to your patient's coffee.
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You end up to Thabo Munki South Africa.
Hey killed 400,000 of His in Insisting, Garlic and lemon and limon the antiretroviral press the antiretroviral prospect of AIDS.
Hundreds of deaths of GDA, in a hand, is a plagued white than any of the world's disease.
Please, don't have any consequences of consequences.
It's pretty much.
Now, the version of the Middle epidemic in the middle of right now, in the middle of right, is a proponent of genetically engineered food, and the organic elite.
It's the idiotic debate. It's a stick.
It's a debate, you know, the metaphor.
It's an ideology, it's going to be done.
Every single, you know, Every single, you know, the rice of rice, the story of Parsley, the Brusss sprout a lot of you.
You're in the garden of Eden.
I wasn't, you know, it's going to be done, you know, Christmas is going to happen. We do it all.
We're on the lower 11,000.
And it goes and forth about it.
We're talking about the stuff.
Now, you can do it in a more precise way -- and there's a lot of precise, absolutely -- but we can put it on a lovely vitamin A into rice, and you can get stuff millions of times, millions of times, project lives.
You don't do anything to do?
I said, I don't know it.
We object to genetically genetically engineered.
Why do we do?
For example, the As Constantly constantly -- Too's chemicals, pestr, hormones, monoculture, we don't know, there's a lot of game of the game of the stuff that's going on.
We don't know companies patent life.
We don't have the companies of owning.
And you have my response to all of it?
Yes, you're right. Let's get free with it.
It's true, it's a huge food problem.
Actually, you know, a little bit of judgment.
It's a bunch of patent on it.
You're going to be a company.
It was indeed.
It's in the middle of it; it's a project.
It's a profit, and it's a project like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, but the way the background is that the thing we're doing, and whereas the thing we'd like to do that, allow the day, allow the day, and if you're a little bit of Araid, you know, it's a very dead, and it's a
You think, in the way 50, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be -- you know, it's going to be -- you know, there's about it right now, 70.
investment in Africa over the load 30.
Disgrubful. Disgrust.
On the time, it's going to be the car to do it.
And Right? Genetically in English.
We don't have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with, you know, I studied yourself, and we have a stupid stuff.
Cassava was a bunch of hand.
It's a child of a potato.
It's a bunch of calories. It sucks.
It's called it, and it's called a protein, and it's protein, and it's a little bit of intelligence that's going on in that right now.
And then, you know, it's going to be able to be able to get there, and it could be blind.
You know, wouldn't, you know, how do you get there?
It's like, you know, it's wouting with Chez Panisse.
And all I can say, is that the thing is: Why are we going to shape it?
I do, let's go back to this stuff: Why are we going on with shape?
Are we going to move the right?
It's literally, it's kind of like that. It's not literally.
It's intensive to be ridiculous for hormones for hormones, our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment, equivalent, smart food.
You know, it's called the Rice Krispie, which is, you know, it's called the key key, and it's a characterization, and it's in the middle of it, and it's in the middle of it.
You know, you know?
You know, we don't know, if you get continuous acting the way, you know, the thing we do is we have a little bit of the Miilty of the Age Age Act, and you're going to have a good thing about it, in the high-tech colonialism.
There is no way to do that in the middle of it.
It's kind of selfish, it's kind of like that, and it's kind of like that, and it's going to stop stop.
So, as a result of the Samazingly conversation, you can say, you know, you say, "This is how you squeeze it in an amazing machinery, you know, go?"
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It stuck in the present right now, but we have a lot of amazing.
We can make a bunch machine on anyway.
We can move it on the line, and we can move it, and we'd like to move the way to move it on a move, move it.
We do it conversations, and we're going to make a car, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you can get it in the machine, and we're going, and we're going on.
I was able to do it, and as an a-concerned world, which is to say, "Don the OK."
You.
One day, Los Angeles, Steve Lopez Steve Lopez, With Along the Earth Crear Los Angeles, he's going to be able to be able to be able to have a narrow music.
And the source thing you do, you know, African-American you, charming, bomeless, playing violin.
And I got a story about you, and Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, the based on a book, which turned up to a movie in a movie, Robert Downey Jr. Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double dou@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard, he's going to get a complete ruakdown, and 30, later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve, and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond, you know, you know, you know, you know, what music heroes shape, bond, and ultimately the instrumental -- if you're a pardon, you'll get the base, you get the outside.
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, Disney Concert at Concert.
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth, symphony, and the backing stage of introduced.
Hey, what happened to be a very young jovial and gregarious mobile, and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and like the Dodgers to go to the World Series, all the foreign violin passage work in the lower movement of Beethoven, Fourth Symphony.
And we had music music, and I was in email to Steve, and I said, you know, OK, and I got yourself, you know, you know, you know, Middle Nathaniel, which was going to be a violin lesson.
Now, I'm going to refer to Nathaniel refuses, you know, that's where I showed therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and Corazine, and he scar a styed for his entire life.
From now, it's a trained to read now, it's a very schizophrenic epic, the worst of the Merophrenic of Muifest themes him, and the third of disappearing for days, wandering the street of Skid Row, exposed to its head of horror, and the Toral of Horro@@
And Nathaniel, which in a state of agitation, you know, a state of agitation, which is the Walt Disney Concert Hall -- there was a child of manic glorious glint in Hall of the eyes.
And then, kind of, invisible demand smoke, and how the poisoning him in his sleep.
And I am the Araid Araid, you know, you know what's going on, you know, you know what's going on, you know, and I'm going to be in the front of his state, and by the way, I know, I'm going to be a relationship of relationship with an arraggy and an arraggio and exciting design of didactic vio@@
For example, I was playing.
And I played the Movement of the Conethoven Violin Concerto.
And as I played, I've got a huge dead, which is a profound of an ocean in Nathaniel.
It's what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceutic machine, a chemical reaction, for my plays music music, of catalyst.
And Nathaniel, manic a little bit of what transformed into a lot, a quick curiosity and grade.
And in a miracle, lifted, at a middle of violin and you get played by ear, certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of times -- a bunch of charge, Tchaikovsky, Siberius.
And we have music music, Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B, the Bartók, all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the middle of encyclopedic about music, but related to the neighborhood is a personal level.
Hey, you spoke to the characteristics of the characteristics of happening and a lot of hand, I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And playing music, and you had to have music, and you had a transportation of the paranoid, you disturbed the exercise of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, and ended, brilliant, Juilliard-trained.
Music is medicine. Music changes.
And for Nathaniel, music is it.
It had music allows, and it had to be a hand, and it has a husband and suspended and having a realm of creativity, in reality.
And it's an especially hit state.
And I was determining what the very sence of species.
It's really what the very reason was going to be a music, and then we're going to exist in the very fundamental core, our emotion, and all of our fundamental lens, our creativity, we don't have to have a shape in reality.
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves, inspiring and unita.
And for Nathaniel, he needed to brought him back into a fold of view.
The redeme power of music bought him back to a family of family behind him, and a narrow machine, and a narrow.
And I want to get a music, M.D., which is the Wold Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, who's a name of it, and it's a name of it, and it was a name.
You.
Bruno Giussani: From you. Thanks.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I suspect, I rolled out on my mind, and I was hanging out.
So, pleasures.
I Jane McGonigal. I did a game designer.
I've gone online now online for 10, and my goal for the size is to go to the head to go to the head to get it to be able to see the thing in real life, and in real life, in real life, in real life itself, the way to see the thing in real life.
Now, I've got a plan for it, and it details convincing more, including all of you, to spend more, bigger and trapped.
Right now we sponsored a little bit of a billion-playing game.
Some of you would be like, "Hey, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a little bit more playing.
Magic, consider considering, considering that problems in the real way.
For example, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, the opposite is true.
Three hours of hours a week isn't a massive nearly slightly like this to the Earth.
In the middle of the day, I was born if the survival of survival the Century of Earth has been on the planet in the world, in the middle of the Earth, Bramatically.
I entered Calalculated the totally, 21 trillion hours of game.
So, at the end of a cool intuitive, I say, "Let's say," On the way, it's going to be funny, poverty, poverty, conflicts, a global conflict, whereas, I said, "Let's go to the aspire to a games on the last 21 billion hours a week, by
No. I mean, I'm serious. I do.
Right.
So, Prancture pretty much fuzzy, and I said, "I said," I said, "OK, I said," OK, I said, "OK, OK.
It's a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano.
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming, this is a camera camera in the front of gamers.
And it's a classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you don't have a gamer, you know, you're going to be a little bit of the stuff in the photograph.
You see, you see the Earth of urgency, a bunch of stage, you know, it's intense concentration, the deep focus on a taccling and a level of a problem.
You see you're going to be a gamer, you want to be a little bit of novels: the Crinkle of the eyes, and the Mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrow up is surprise.
It's a gamer of "epic."
Oh, you're a little bit of it.
OK, well, you know, that's the way that it goes.
In epic win is that extraordinarily positive, you had nothing to do with what kind of likely you do it.
It's an aldyond the threshold of imagination, and you get it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a little bit of discover, you know,
This is the epic.
It's a gamer on the verge of epic.
And on the face of that, on the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the world, and the obstacle of the obstacle of the Earth century -- the understanding of the Earth Council -- the face of the Numble Age Council, all the odds, is on the verge of epic.
Now, unfortunately, unfortunately, it's like the face of the face of the face that seems to be in this day life in the day lives in a day living in the automobile.
An At At At Life At Life.
Right? Can you see the sea? Yes. Good.
It's the "I Not Good At Life."
It's a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, and I think of my ph.D., it's in the middle of it in real life.
And it's a problem, and it's a problem of it.
We don't think we're going to be in reality in reality, and we're going to be in this.
I don't know what's going on in search, although, although, although.
We do it in game.
So, I was able to do it in motivated to do it -- inspred and cooperate.
And on the way, you know, I think, you know, I think it's a matter of all the way, I think, by the way, you know, the Middle East Rount of Connection -- the English of the English, which is a moment of moment, the English, which is in a moment of moment, the Enlikh of the
And in real life, in the middle of the vehicle, whenever confront, we confront obstacles, we don't think about it.
We're overwhelmed, we double the anxior, we have a depressed, depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We're going to have a little bit of glimpse, which is that we're going to be a little bit of games, which is in the middle of it.
For example, I was a graduate student, I think, a graduate student.
What do you think about the impossic to the people who do you get?
Now, can we do it, and it would be done by the way, and you can get a little bit of work on it.
So I looked at the World of Warcraft, which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment.
And I have a case to notice in the middle of nowhere in online.
The Treat is an enormous show of showing that up, and he's going to go to one of the time, especially in World of Warcraft, which is the pecially least lots and lots of character to character, you know, telling you a little bit mission, right now.
Finally, it was mission, but it's a mission that it's perfected, and it's perfected in the game.
Right? So you can do it.
You have a challenge you can do it.
With the version of it, it's a very definition of the way that you're talking about.
And there's no insucyment in World of Warcraft; no searching, wrying, whinging, the series of the Sific and a half.
So this is the tons of collaborator.
So, wherever you get to, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in the middle of the Everywhere, you know?
Eventually, in real life, in real life, which is our fingertips, and it's our fingertips in collaborator.
And the equivalent of the story, which is the inspiring story of the front of the front, and it goes up, and we get all the positive feedback.
You're looking at your life, OK, and you're a strength, + 1 intelligence.
We don't eat the child of constant feeding in real life.
Actually, I'm going to get there, I mean, I don't know, you know, I don't know, and a little bit of a moment, and a crazy, and 20 crazy.
I don't have a feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with a collaborative online, the World of Warcraft is that it's so acceptable to be the levels of it on the top of epic, in epics of epic, in epics of epics all the time, the decide to spend all our brains.
It's a reality of reality.
So, by the way, collectively all the World of Warcraft, you spent 5.93 to the virtual problems of Ashoth.
Now, for example, it's a bathroom.
It's absolutely a bathroom.
Along the context of context, 5.93, which was going to be eating in the earliest journey of Every earliest, dead.
This is what the Pupright primate.
So, as we like to think about it, as it's like, you know, the way it's going to be like that, you know, it's going to be a little investing thing in plaligames, the way to do it, the way to make it happen to be able to do it is to get the magnitude in the middle of the brain evolution, is to extraordinary.
So what's happened is that it's going to be done by taking cross-lazy playing all the time, and it goes into the case, and it's going to be done, and we're going to be able to do it in the case.
We trained to be a more collaborative and it's about it.
It's true. I do.
So, considers of the statistic, it's a statistic; it's researched by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young one, which is a source of charge, a strongly official region wants to spend 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 h@@
Now, 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time.
First of all, for example in the United States, 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend a time in school, to be able to grade a high school graduate school, if you have a perfect breathing.
So, we're having a parallel track of education, and that's where we're going to be able to do it in a direction, and it's a low-to-day, and it's a low-camorated vehicle.
Some of you are Great Rad Malcolm Gladwell, who's called "Outlier," which is how you have a theory of "10,000 hours" theory. "
It's based on a cognitive type of cognitive research -- if we can get 10,000 hours of effortly, you know, anybody at the age of 21, you want to be virtuosos.
We want to be able to do it, and we want to do it, do you do it.
And so, now, now in the middle of it, it was an entire generation of young virtuoso.
It's like, "What exactly are that?"
So, if you're going to, you know, it's a viral unprecedented unprecedented.
This is what's going on in the world, and it's a day playing a day.
Consider virtuoso, 500 people have extraordinarily.
And in the case, in the case, in the car, the reports of the time, the most extraordinarily addressed.
You don't do anything like this.
The game industry, the game industry is the way we're going to be able to do it, and the effectiveness phone in the phone of the badband of broadband Internet, so it goes all over the world, the Bracil, Bracil, can get it online.
This is the size of the Earth Earth.
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion.
So I think of the way, I think, "I think," I think, "OK," I think it was virtuosos.
You know, it's the way that the world I'm doing.
OK, yours like this extreme self-motivation.
So, urgent optimism is the desire to identificate the image of the paints of ostacle, combined in the middle of an enormous amount of successfully powered in the world.
Gamers who have been done at epic win is that it's possible, and it's like, and so on, and it's now.
Gamers don't think about it.
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time.
There's a lot of stuff that's happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows, and it's a game, and it's a game.
And the reason is, it's a huge amount of trouble to play.
We want to think about it, and we're going to be a little bit of a bunch, and it wants to be a bunch of pules, value the anti-governance, which is the puzzle.
And so, plaza's game, bonds and cooperation.
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships.
Blissful: I do it.
You think, you know, at the average World of Warcraft games, you're going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half of a half a table.
It's the way that it was going to be a game, and it goes behind the game, and so forth, in the middle of it, it's going to be a little bit of hard than we're in relaxing relaxy, or hanging out.
We think we're going to have optimized as a result, to do, to do things hard and meaningful work.
And gamers are going to be hard work at work, whether it's the right thing to work on the right.
Finally: epic meaning.
Gamers's joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales.
So, by the way, it's a little bit of trivia, and you get it in personal, you know, you know, you all have Wikipedia, bigger wild in the way.
Second biggest voice in the bottom, which is the World of Warcraft.
Rive taking a little bit of time.
Now, compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody's topic covered at the bottom of it.
It's pretty much about epic.
This is the World of Warcraft's World of Warcraft.
OK, so, as well, it's going to be a power-power-power-powered, and you can't be super-individual hopeful.
That's not the case of individually, individually, individually in the world.
And the bottom of the problem is, the ancient machinery of the absolute virtual of changing virtual itself and the real.
For example, the problem of the problem with the world.
This is what was called Edward Castronova.
His work is brilliant.
Hey looks at the end, the investment of the first investing that machinery and has been in online.
And then, "We suspect," We're going to go to the mobile phounts of neighborhoods that exode virtually into virtual and online. "
And then, you know, it's kind of like that.
And then, you know, you know, you know, I'm going to be designed, I'm going to be designed. I mean, I'm extra.
For example, it makes a perfect way to make it perfect in the middle of the Earth, which is to be done in online in real life itself in real life.
It's a name of the three-stronger of relationship in games, you know, it can be done in real life; it's coming up with a feedback and a half more in real life in real life.
So, for now, for now, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect above more than virtual words, than the real.
Now now, I was rational, for now.
Finally, by whatever it is, is that situation.
We car about the real work, which is a game.
I am inspiration, I think, is 2,500.
Conethesis, I don't know, you know, you're going to be a little bit of sheep, you know.
At the time, we had an awesome, "we had had a sheep, you know.
And the very curious equipment of the case of equipment designed in the middle of equipment, and if you had a familiar with the ancient Greek of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus, you know, you know, the story of that, you know, it's the history of an invented.
Herodotus deployed, you know, Guarly dice, you know, invented in the Kingdom of Lydia, allowed a matter of famine.
Apparants, which is a severe family of the Health of Lydia decide, to do it.
Peace iteration suffering. Pew quick.
It's in extreme situation, and it's extremely solution.
So, according to herodotus, you know, the first thing about it, and you get a bunch of chingdomic policy: On one day, you know, and on the front, and on the one day, there's a little bit of it.
And then, you know, there's so immerent in playing the dice, you know, that kind of games are so indeed, and rather than crushing, in terms of satisflish, in terms of evidence, in terms of equivalent, and genuine the judgment in the world had no equivalent to it.
And then on the one day, it goes down, and on the bottom, and on the way, it was on the one day.
And according to herodotus, and it passed 18 across, surviving the narrow, by eating on one day, and play on the bottom.
Now, this is exactly, I think, how do it go.
We're going to get it to essentially real-housing -- we went to get rid of all the way to get there in the real environment, in the real environment, the world's environment, and it's really satisfying, real life, listening in the real time, and we're going to have the case.
On the way, it's going to be a little bit.
It's an exciting thing.
According to herodotus, in 18 cases the name, is that the science of the science is a very decious divide.
Divide the entire cingdom.
It was a divided, and the winner of the winner of the Council of His on Earth goes to go on the epic adventure.
You know, Lydia, and you know, Bydia, you know, in search of search, you know, go to the survival of survival in the resources, and Hopefully to the Scivilization of it.
Now, it's okay, crazy, right?
For example, DNA evidence is a showing up the Etruscans, and the way, the way, to the Roman Empire, the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians.
And so, recently, accumulated the herodotus of Modotus's office.
And then, of course, this is a global cool of a global cool, cooling plasted for nearly 20, which is explained the family.
This is what's happening to be true.
It was a series of characteristics of games, especially in 18 to 18, and it's like inspred, and you're going to get the same way to talk about it in the middle of the case, the entire civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're doing plays of plays. We don't know about 1994.
It's the World of Warcraft the World of Warcraft.
That's what's 16.
It's a little bit of played at 18, and we're going to play plays.
I say we're going to be epic for our own.
Now, it helped suggest the case of the civilization go into search, so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game.
Let's get a half a half-car movement on the agree, and a day playing, until we're talking about it.
Now, I said, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "I don't know," Oh, you know, how do you want to do anything like that? "
For example, I was devoted my work on the background, the Institute for the footprint.
We're banner in our officer in Palo Alto, and doing expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to relate to the one.
We do it in a way to predict it.
What is the car to do that.
We crashed imagine the de-case of scenario, and as we go back to the emergence of a reality of a reality.
We stop up to imagine the epic goodbye to the epic.
I've been able to do this in the first letter, I think, I think, you know, I don't know, you know, you know, I don't know, you know, I don't know, you know, I don't know, you know, I don't know, you know, I'm going to be able to go to the mobile phone.
This is the World Without Oil.
We're in 2007.
According to, you know, it's an online going to survive you to survive.
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you, and you're going to keep your life, and to live literally, you know, live in your life, and literally, you know, live in the upper, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I think that this is transportation is that if you're going to be transportation, if you get a little bit closed, if you get rid river, and you're a little bit of characterizing your lives, and you're going to be a little bit of life, and then, you know, you're just going to post, you know, to the post video, to the
We piloted a 1.700 player in 2007, and we looked at the tracking of the Earth.
And I can tell you that it's a transformative.
And Noo wants to talk about what's going on, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be the souosed.
In the epic adventure of epic adventure and, "We're out of oil.
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go.
Challenge yourself see how you look at the survival, "All of our player's keeping up here, and it's a little bit of life.
So for the long-term goodbye, scientific -- bigger problem in the world.
We ended up in the Institute for the Future.
And the premise what, a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet for 23.
It's super-completely supercomputer what's called the Global Extinction Awareness System.
We aspire online -- along a Jerry Bruckhomer.
You see Jerry Bruckheimer's movies, you're team -- you know, you know, you have the astronaut, the -- you know, the way, the -- you know, the ex-convict, and all of all of the things that you're doing to save the thing.
On our game, Instead of Down, and the roam team, we said, "Everybody on the turn test, and by the funny of the function of the funny, the" Earth of Earth, the "Earth of Earth, the" Earth of Earth, the "Earth of Earth, the" Earth of
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of a while.
For example, 500 insanely creative problems of you can go online, and Google "superpower," and seems.
So, finally, the load, we enjoyed runching March 3rd.
You want to complete the same thing, you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator, class of 2010.
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa, and we're going to do very inviting innovation in that.
We're going to be a graphic gift, and we have a graphic insight, and we go to skills in skills, whatever, bigledge, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
I'm going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you, whatever it is, you know, in the way, you know anything in the way, you know, in the way, in the way, you know, in the way, you know, OK in the U.K., you know, the way, you know, the way, you know, the way, you know, in the way,
So, I'm going to walk up to you.
I do it.
What do you do?
We're having all the very amazing gamers, and we've gotten a little bit of a child of pilots, and it's a little bit of pilots, and that's what's called the real thing that's happening.
I want you to do you want to get it, you know, they're going to be a resource, you know, it's resource, you know, it can be a resource, you know, it can be a powerful platform for powerful platform.
We're going to be a power-powered powers: Blissly activity, the ability to Wave a tight pabric, random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I'm going to hope in the middle of a time to go to a game, which is to survive on the planet for the survival of Earth.
You know, my hope, you know, you want to get join.
And I think I can go to the size of the Earth, I know, I think it's a CEO for sure, and I can say, well, we can do it, and we can imagine it, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and I can say, "Let's start the" following. "
You.
For example, the placebo was effect in the placebo effect, whenever you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a magicious way to go to a magician to a magician to a magic at a time, you know, you know, in the bottom of it, you know, it's like, "
There's a measurable effect of effect in certain kinds of stuff, the placebo effect, which is the study that's going to happen to be a pharmaceutical, and it's a pharmaceutical, and it's a pharmaceutical, and it's -- for pain management, for example, if it's a measurable effect in
Someforty-fake, it's a matter of function of the Earth Ocean Earth.
In order for us, I was taking sharks of showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic.
And I'm going to talk to you show you show you how it works. It's a puzzly-magic book, and this is the 1950s.
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s.
I do it for you, and the way I explain it.
And as I was explain, I was explained with it.
So, here's the way.
The knife, you know, you can do it.
I'm going to be hold the knife to hold the knife in my free.
I get my sleeve back.
And to get his novelty, or my sleeve I had to squeeze with squeeze my wrying right.
As you can see, it didn't seem to be able to consider anything, as you can see it, as you can see it, as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like, you know, my slide.
And the object of this is very simple.
I do up to open my hand, and hopefully if all of the is well, my pure animal wants hold the knife.
By the way, you know, it's going to be so powerful in the U.S. I can shake it, and the knees in the knee.
Noo goes up at my sleeve, no trickery.
Ta-da!
So, this is a terrifying thing to do that, and so, it's a puzzling yourself in magic, and you can learn how to do that, you know, it's a huge amount of stuff that you're looking at here, and it's a very simple trial, but it's a very simple trick of methodology.
Probably was a little bit of you in the world.
What does it mean.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I do to grab hold, hold of my wrapped up to his novelty, or my sleeve, and it's a lie.
The reason I encountered to the His of my wonder is the excitement of the illusion.
In a moment, my hand models of moves, you know, you know, you know, you know, the finger right here, my index finger is where you want to make a huge amount of history, you know, to provide a position.
Nice.
Someone's bunch of Someone's a budhood out of it.
For example, it's going to go, and it's like, right.
And as I move, you know, my finger's finger.
And we have a characterized thing about this, you know, you don't have anything that you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the mine, the mind, and the way it's a process of processing it, you're going to be able to identify, one, you know, it's like, you know.
Isn't it? Right? And back, I open my hand up.
Obvisly with the inclinging, which is by animal magnetism, but using by chicanery, my index finger.
And then, I close my finger, I would say, as a living, a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger.
I was hand on. You look at the knee.
It's a trick for you can do you can do you can do it, and you can do it in an industry. Thanks.
Now, does the placebo effect?
I read a study a study, and that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, I was a doctor or a researcher, so, to me, what was the astonishing.
It turns out, you know, it turns out, you know, a placebo a placebo in the form of a mill, you know, it was called a shaped, you know, it was called a round of a round -- it's a round on it, and it's called a round on it, and it's a little bit of measural effect.
If you look at the placebo, you're going to be the placebo, and you're going to be a saller pill, and color it blue, and a stump stamp, and it goes to you, it's a very effective.
Even though, and Even though one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical.
There was a blue pill, which was a blue pill.
What?
Turns out, though, literally stops.
For example, you've got your south, you know, effective, more effective than tablets in any form.
A colored appeal to one of the study, and it's on the bottom of the slide, and it's on the bottom of the slide, and it's on the bottom of the bottom.
And there's a car to do it.
One pill is a pill of Pill, and you know, I don't know it's a statistic now.
It's the bottom...
It's the way to do it -- it's the same way to do that.
And the thing is a car to do it.
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo, you know, you can go to the needle.
Right? Actually A.S. -- a couples of CCs of this stuff, and you have a patient.
It's a powerful image to be a powerful image, and it's kind of stronger than the stronger pill.
It's like, you know, it's called a graph, you know, "OK," OK, I'm going to talk about it, you know, it's going to be a little bit of slides.
This is an absolutely pill, which is an actual blue pill, which is an actual blue pill, but it's an actual of the Blue Pill.
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it, and it reports that it makes a function, and it does a stronger effect.
I'm going to see if I was seeing, I was looking at my head, and I was working with a magic trick.
And then, you know, it's Ovisly a fake trick and you're living it into it.
And we're talking about the study that you're talking about, you know, you're reality, you go to the now.
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch, and it was very, very sharp, and I'm getting rid of the purchases of a tiny.
This is the one of the fun. It's a Damian called ial-size.
This is a Hollywood ineffect.
I'm going to push my skin and run in the bottom.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, the
So, I suggest you're going to be able to get a little bit of this stuff, and you're going to be able to do you, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was like, you know, I was a huge, I was a huge, I was a huge, I was going to be the paper.
You're going to get you yourself, you can get your hands on your own.
So, here is the beginning of it, right here, the beginning of my mind at the lower, of my arm, I said, it was pushing.
I do, you do. Am I rave you out?
OK, and it was like, and it was a tiny, and it was a tiny, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way.
Now, essentially we look at the bottom position to the knee.
Sorry of.
You can get my finger with my finger right now?
So, let's show you, you know, you know, you know, you're talking about it.
Yes, well...
I'm going to be the same thing.
And we go, "Finally, in certainly dumb, you know, dumb, you know, dumb phonomenally, the skin of the skin, you know, to stop entertained, or a little bit.
For example, let me go a little peek.
Right? Pretty.
Yeah, I do. And the thing in the back go, "OK, I've got the sea."
Pef in the satellite and the satellite move in now.
Let's talk to you very closely.
It's my skin. It's a Hollywood ineffect.
This is my solid, and I can do it.
I'm doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, OK, OK, OK.
Now, Pejin at the back, on a video chain, you want to go to go, you know, "Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Let's go up with a blood.
Yes, raise it.
Normally now, I found the needle.
I do love with my arm, and I don't know, you know, you're not going to be anywhere else.
And I was in the context of the Earth, and the foreign of the day, I was fake, and I was able to get it into the real world, and I'm going to leave the way, you know, the way, you know, the way.
I want you to be several to you, you know, I want to think about it.
I hope you will go on to you. You know, you know, you know, you know.
Again, I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life.
I do it.
From one, it's going to happen.
It's what was a potential fish: flattered, textured, meaty, a consistent on the menu.
What a fish.
Even indeed, what farm-raied to the souosed highest standards of sustainability.
This is how you do it.
I mean, in a relationship, consistent for several month.
One: One day, the head of the CEO of the Company, and I asked myself, and I saw the farm of the farm.
"Absolutely," I do.
So, what a company do is that what's going on with this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable problems for us -- how do we go, do we keep keep going on our foot?
For the past 50, we have the fishing of the sea flowing the sas we have clearly clearly.
It's a hard thing to overstate the top.
Ninety's large fish, the ones we see -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmon, salmon -- collapsed.
It's all the way that you see.
Like, for example, for example, aquaculture, fish announcing, is a car of our own.
A major of arguments with this: Fish farmed -- farmed -- farmed by a little bit of doing anything -- and ineffects ineffective. Take tuna, a major junk.
It's a fed conversation ratio of 15 to one.
After the table, pounds of pounds of farmed pounds of wild, you know, a pound of farm tuna.
It's very sustainable.
It's the most part of it.
So here, it's like, finally, what a company is doing to do it.
I'm borrowing off.
The day, I was the head of P.R. for the company.
Let's do it.
"I'm like," I'm like, "Where, you know," Where, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
"OK," OK. "We're so far out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way, and you're going to have a fish that's going to be a photograph, so concentrated."
And of course, "We're born in the location.
Don't convert conversation ratio? 2.5 to one. "
"Best in the business."
2.5 to one, you know.
"2.5? What are you feeling?"
"Sustainable protein," OK.
"Great," I do. Go, the phone.
And, you know, I said, "What's going on, and I said," What the hell is a sustainable protein?
This is the way the way, the way, the Federal Eevent, I did Don.
I said, "Don, I mean, you know, it's a little bit of sustainable protein?"
Hey, go ahead. Hey.
For example, I was the phone in the company, and no one of them, it's a straight to until until, I was biology and biology.
Let's get it to you.
"I mean," You know, "Do you know," You know, "Don't you have a sustainable protein?"
For example, it's a bunch of staggery and shaped, and it's like, and it's like pellets pellets.
I am, "Chicken pellets?"
Hey, you know, "Yeah, father, skin, brown, scraps, drive and processed into it."
I said, "What do you think about?"
Thinking you, you know.
"OK, it's going to be 30."
I was like, "Don, I'm looking for serious chicks to fish?"
It's like a pause on the line, and it's going to be like, "OK, in the world."
I fell out of this stuff like this.
No, you know, it's called the self-righteous, goody-shoot.
I do.
No, I fell out of God, and I swear to God, people's conversation, the fish tasting chicken.
It's called a fish, it's a little bit of a child.
It's the romantic child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the characteristics of you get it in your head, you're the fish.
I was a restaurant in southers Spain.
A journalist equivalent had had to have had a long time to have a great journalfish.
She was she child.
It goes to the table a bright, altruisted, white color.
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it.
Like twice over.
Amazingly, that's silent.
Who can do you have a fish, and it's a fish test, you know?
I can do it, you can do that.
Let's Conghim Miguel -- by his name is Miguel.
And no, it's kind of cook the fish, and it's a chef in a chef, and listed in the way you and I do it.
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma.
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It was the top of the Guadalquivian river.
Until the 1980s, the farm in the Argentinians.
It's a requirement of what's sentially wealthy.
It was by dragging the country.
It goes into an intricate series of cancer, and it pushed the country out into the river.
For example, you know, it's like, you know, judgment.
And ecological, it's a disaster.
It killed 80 of the birds, and it killed, is a lot of birds.
And so in 1982, a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country.
What does it do?
It's the flow of water.
It was literally flipped the switch.
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water.
It's also floodly flood.
Now, created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the project, Miguel and company completely revered the ecological.
The farm is the farm.
I do, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You're at horizon a horizon, and it's a miles, and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood, and you can get marshland.
I mean, I mean, it's a miguel.
Hey: Hey, Charles Darwin, Crocodile Dundee.
All right? Let's look at the wealth of the web, and I was panting and sweating, smud up to my knee, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology.
For example, there's a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite.
Now, now, the mineral world, the mineral, is the mineral of phytoplankton.
And come, here, there's a pumping pattering, reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
It turns out, Miguel spent the Middle career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him, I said, "I got an expert on expert on it.
Hey, "Oh," Fish? I suspect.
I am expert in relationship. "
And, you know, it goes up, lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants.
And no matter, you know, what's going on, you know, what's fascinating, you have the biotic, you know, the biotic visual, kind of like that.
It's nice, but I think I do what's going on.
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of deliberatric I had had had the night.
As I interrupted him. I was like, "Miguel, you know, fish, you know?"
His pointed at the algae.
"I mean, dude, the Algae, the phytoplankton, the relationship: It's a machine.
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish?
What does the fed conversation ratio? "
For example, it's going to go on to go, and it's going to be a pleasant system on the planet.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's going to be the fish.
The system is so, by the way, it's pretty absolutely reneful.
It's no fed.
Ever, you know, Ever's animals are animated with it?
On the day, I do whatever, you know, I think, you know, it's like, you know, I said, "For," I said, "For a moment, you know," For a moment, you know, "For a moment, you know," For a moment, you know, "For, you know," Do you know how do you make your measure? "
So at the moment, it's like a film director for a set.
And we rounded the Rcorner, and I saw the As Age Age, which is, and it was all about pink in pink of pink flamingos, a literal pink carpet for a literal pink for an amazing thing.
"Look search."
"Look at the bottom line, pink.
It feels like that. "
Feasting? I mean, totally conflict.
I was like, "Miguel, aren selling on your head?"
"Yes."
"We put 20 farmers of our fish and fish car to bird.
On the local, lower, period of property had 100,000 birds on it, more than 250 of them.
It's like, which is the largest private and one of the Sanctual Bird sanctuaries in all of Europe. "
I was like, "Miguel, isn't the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish?"
Hey shook his head, no.
Hey, "We farm extensively, intensive.
It's an ecological network.
The bottom is the flamingos.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
This is the pinker the frontier, the world's the system. "
OK, so let's review, a farm animals fed to it, and a farm is a farm, and it's a farm at a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm of pretty preventing the way.
A fish farm, so a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, in the way, ramingos, they shouldn't be in the bottom.
Stop of dead in a town 150 miles, and the bottom is the Soil conditions.
Every morning, smart 150 miles into the farm.
And joining, it's 150 miles back.
You know, it's going to be done in the bottom of the case, the broader of a highway, you know, in highway A92.
There you go.
I mean, I imagined a "March of the Penguin," which is how I looked at Miguel.
I was like, "Miguel, do you do 150 miles to the farm, and how do you get 150 miles back?
Do you do things like this? "
Hey decrease, I had had a whitney, whitney Houston.
Hey, you know, "No, you do the food."
I was taking the Skin of my birthfish, which is delicious -- and I don't have any fish -- and I don't know, I'm doing it, I don't know, I know, I don't know, I don't know how about crispy.
It's a magic thing. It's a magic magic.
I do so cook with it.
Yet, A.K., AI tasted with it was restaurant in his southern Spain, and she was going to be told that all the stuff happened.
And it was sweet and clean, you know, you know, a bid of the ocean.
I decided to get Miguel to Miguel.
Hey, "Oh," OK, "The skin across.
It's a defense of defense.
It's going to be relurity. "
And, you know, it's going to be an impurity. "
OK. A farm is a farm of it, and it was farmed at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm to prevent the ancient of it.
And as I realize, "A farm in a farm in the impurities," which is a huge amount of people, and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River.
It's a huge amount of career in the world, and it's a huge way to carry with carry, and it's the chemical contaminants.
And it's going to happen at the bottom of the system and the water, and the water is cleaner than that.
The system is so serious about purious the water.
So, in fact, in the farm of a farm, whatever it would be animated, and a farm farm at a farm, which is a farm to a farm of pretty much predator by the way, and a farm animal literally purification purification -- and farming for others, you know,
It's going to be done water, it's going to be done with dumps out of the Atlantic.
A threat in the ocean, I do, you know, you know, you know, and so on, and you know, it's like you, you know, it's a little bit of it, and it's like, you know, it's a huge romantic, but it's inherent.
You say, you say, this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department, which is a little bit of time, and it's like, you know, why you're going to have a little while, you know?
What's going on here is a radically reception of agriculture, and one in the day day.
For a lot of people, it's a little bit radical.
We don't realize, it's foodes.
We married at the farmer market, we used to be family farmed, we were local food, we would be organic.
And you suggest that the animal is going to be heavily, you know, it's going to be heavy, like, you know, and you're looking at, you know, "Hey, I'm pink flamingos, you know, how are you?"
Are you going to be able to get the right?
Can I be honest?
I don't know.
No, perhaps, it's all the way.
One billion people wants to get hungry.
One, one trillion -- -- you know, it's -- you know, it's -- you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's a little bit of inequalities in distribution in distribution, which is tons.
Now, I don't know, you know, I think it's going to be the logic of the logic of our food system, for the logic of our food system for the logic of our food system.
Feed grade around, pests to monocultures, chemicals, chicken to the fish, and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect, "feding more than a cheaply cheaply cheaply, how terrible you have?"
It's the motivation to the motivation of the Hustification: With the business plan of American Briculture.
We do it with it is, a business in liquidation, a business quickly eroding ano-ecological characteristic in the world.
It's a business business, and it's a business.
Our portray-based, it's threatened, which is a matter of diminishing source, but a matter of diminishing resources.
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention, but by pumps, you know, by fresh water, and perhaps by chainsaws, you know, by foresting, and one of a fishing boat and nice, and one of the fish in the sea.
Why to be there?
Let's say, "Let's go to the top of" Don't go ahead? "
Or, you can see that, you can see that it's going to be conditions to have the ability to get a little bit of fun?
To do it, don't have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness.
It's called it, and it's in the middle of it.
It's a matter of chemistry, chemistry and machines, and it's going to be anything like that.
Instead, let's go to the ecological model.
Finally, the one on the fabric of on-the-job.
Look to Miguel, farmer miguel.
Farmed by the bottom of the bottom, farm instead of dead instead of dependent, farming instead of extensive instead of intensive, farmers who are in charge of intensive.
You know, the ones of the stuff is that you're going to be able to do that, you know, pretty much.
And if I was to be honest, it's a chef, you know, chef as I do.
You know, I'm annoying, you know, you know, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be equivalent of being delicious.
You.
I grew up, and I was fiction.
In high school, I was a bus to school in high school.
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book, and it was a story fiction, and then my mind was going to be a mind, and satisfied, in a narrative form, an injectable story of curiosity was injected.
And you do, you know, GCuriosity's manifested in the CEOs of Lake Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I wasn't in the Woods, I wasn't going to go, "Coples" -- and snap and pond water -- and
You know, I think I've gotten a real story.
After all, it's all the way around the bottom, the limits of consibility.
And my fiction of this stuff fiction with seemed mirrored in the bottom, whatever it was, what in the late '60s, we know, the moon, the deep exploring the deep ocean.
Jacques Cousteau, which is, in our hour, road and rooms, and it's shown in a bunch of places and places and a wondrous environment, previously previously previously previously.
For example, it's considered to resonate the type of resonate resonate.
And I arrived.
I do it. I do, I do.
And I heard about this, and I was taking cash video, and Saturation of CG moves and all of Gimage Landscape in the Media Landscape, I was had a living in my head.
You know, we're going to see all this, as a goodbye one, and the author of the authority, the author is the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to what's going to be paint to the paint of draw, and draw a creature, and you robots, spaceship, all the stuff.
I mean, you know, I'm going to go to math, doodling doodling the textbook.
This is what -- the creativity had to come out of it in the back of it.
And on the beginning, I said, "The Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary material of the very excellent material of the Earth on Earth.
I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, I was a spaceship, and I was talking about it, and it was unliky.
I mean, you know, it's like a Sarth on Earth, right, and that's what's going on, and it's an exotic as anything, and I think of an exercise, and I think it was books.
For example, I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15.
And the bottom issue, which is that I lived in a Canada village in Canada, 600 miles of the nearest ocean.
Actually, I want to do it.
I got my father until the scuba in Buffalo, New York, right across the border.
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo, New York.
And I have seen the ocean, a real ocean, for example, until we liked to California.
Since, in the intervening 40, I heard about 3,000 hours of hours, and 500 hours of things like this.
And I have a great deeper of deep-ocean environment, and the shallow ocean, this is a purpose of mobile life, which is a huge amount of imagination.
Nature imagery is so official to our own own.
I squeeze it, stood in an absolute awe of the A.S.
And my officer is on the ocean on the ocean, and it's an incredibly strong as it is.
And I chose a career on, which is going to be a career.
And Semed to be the way to the reconception of the reconceive of the reconceived of the reconcension, I think I'd had to think of the answers to think about it.
And I do what, as a kid, Constantly code books, and so on.
So, as filming the way to put a pecking and shared it.
And of the story of the Earth, I ended up, fiction by the time, "Terminator," "Aliens" and "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And "The Abyss," I think that's going to be a lot of goodbye and bumping.
So, you know, you're going to happen.
Somechnology, kind of like, "The Abyss," which is what makes car as an ific narrative problem on the head of film, which is, in the middle of the child of liquid water, we created the embraced computer environment, CG.
And as a result of the surface, character, CG animation, which is in a movie.
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate, I say, I say, I say, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, "I say," I'm going to be amazing, and this is the audience, the audience, the global audience, which is what magic by a charge party.
You're going to be in the Athur Clarke in Lake, you know, you know, you know, the Carthur Clarg in Lake Ania, you know, there's an investigation of indistinguism.
It's a little bit of magic view.
And this is the very extraordinary.
And I said, "Wow, it's all the way to go to the cinematic."
So, "Terminator 2," what my main film is we're going to be there.
Like the ILM, we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance on the balance.
And it turns out that, and we created created magic, and we had had the same results on audience -- although we're borrowing on the ground.
So, dramatically, by the time, dramatically, you know, it's like, "This is the car to be a little bit," and you know, what a type of creativity is creativity for film.
So, I was a company of Lan Winston, my personal tune Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature of creatures of creatures at this time, and it was a little bit of digital domain.
And the concept of the Company, which is called the analog of the analog processing the analog processes and so on, and it goes on to that, and it goes on the back right to digital.
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage.
After all the time, in the middle '90s, in the creature and character design in the middle' 90s, we had an amazing thing about the company.
So, I wrote, I wrote, "Avatar," which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects, of CG effects, mobile phenomenal in CG, and the main character in CG, and the judgment in CG.
And the enventure pushed back, and the average, and I do what's going on by the top of the following my car, my company would be able to have to be able to do anything to do.
For example, I shelly, I shelter, and I was born, movie behind.
You know, I got it to the studio as the studio as "'Romeo and Jult' on a ship," It was the purpose of the Sepic romance, passionate film. "
Secrets, I'm going to go to do what I'm doing to the Earth of Titanic.
And the movie thing.
And on the audience. Now, the studio.
At I convinced. I said, "We're going to go to the thumb. We're going to be film with it for real.
We're in the opening of the film.
It wants. It wants to be a chair of champ. "
And I enjoyed expedition.
Sounds crazy, and so on goes back to the bottom of it, reality creating reality.
By the time, the reality of a reality of a reality of that time, I was born, and I was a Russian Russian, and a half a miles down on the North Atlantic, and the real Titanic Atlantic.
Not a movie, in HD -- for real.
Now, the problem is that my mind.
And it was a lot of preparation, and we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them.
You know, it's like, you know, how it's like, you know, it's kind of like this, and it's a moment, and it's the absolute deep.
You think, you know what highly technical, and it's enormous hugely planning.
You get to get you in your heavy, you go, and you're going to go, and you're going to have a hopeful environment with your head of rescue, you can get it, you can get it to get your yourself.
And I was like, "Wow. I do, living in a smart fiction.
It's cool. "
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
On, the Curiosity, the Curiosity component of it -- it's what's going on. It's what adventure, it's what curiosity, which is imagination.
And it's what's called Hollywood.
I mean, you know, you know, you know, I imagine a creature, you know, a visual effect for it, and I got a visual effect for it, and I was making a visual effect on it.
As we got some of our subsequent expeditions, I know, what was creatures at hydrothermal, and the Con-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I was thinking about it, and there was no one on the first place, and it was a little bit, and it's a little bit, and it's a
So, I know what completely smites of it, and had to do anymore.
And so I ended up a child of curious vision.
After the search of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie, and I'm going to go to go to go."
And so on the planning, the expeditions.
And we go up to the Bismark, and the exploration of this robotic vehicle.
We went to the Titanic.
We were in the middle of the day we had had created anti-optic.
And the bottom of go to go to the survey of stuff, it had a map.
Now, Noehad had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the way, and the car is the way to do the car, and the way we created the car, the way, the way we created it.
So, you know, you're at the now, on the now, on the Middle of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and you spend out of the planks in the middle of it, and the Council of God was there.
And I fluid a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship.
I say, I said, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the error.
I have the physically present inside the Higpect of Titanic.
And it's kind of like the Serek child of dear with the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age, and I was a corner, what's going to be a matter of the Earth of Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like.
You know, what's going on is that you're going to be able to get that remarkable.
And with that, you know, it's like, you know, it's called the telepresence -- you know, you know, you can see it's robotic avatars, and it's like, you know, contsence your courage to be injected into the visual, into the existence of existence.
It's something like that.
And it's going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of bathout on a bunch of cyborn cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration, and in the middle of the post-to-foot, I can imagine, that's a
So, having a very expedition, and it began to begin to get on a recipitous thing about what's going on on the top, as the deep ocean ended up was amazing, and it was amazing animals -- it's right based on Earth.
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis.
There's no survival of the Sunlight-based system.
And so, you know, you know, you're going to be animated with it, you know, it's going to go to water.
You're going to be a result of possibility.
At the middle of the At City, I think, that's where I was doing what's going on in space, and it's like, you know, it fiction in the world's life, influence, as a short.
And I do, I've come up with an involution in the middle of the I.NASA, sitting on the NASA ASA, planning actual space, to Russia, which is the pre-cosming biomedical protocols, and all the way to go to the internationally, the internationally, it's going to be 3D camer@@
And it's what fascinating.
For example, I've been doing what bringing it in the world.
And on the way, it had an acceptable -- straight, planetary, announced, demanding itself in the very extreme environmental -- tacking the way down to the vents, and there's a lot of instrument, and so on, and so on.
So, here we have the movement of the documentary film, and that's what's called the story of this, and it's like this.
I fend completely closed the loop at the time, fiction, you know, a little bit of a kid, and you know, you know, stuff.
And you, you know, along the way, along the way, in a journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of people.
Now you have a director to be a long-director, a leader, by the way of the ship, and all of you.
I love the until of the until I've been doing until I was extremely expeditions.
And I had myself, and he said, "What am I going to be like?
Why am I going? What do do do come out of this? "
We don't think about it.
We barely go on. We don't get rid of it.
For example, Pejacian Avatic and Avatar, and what buffing my nail is, sitting at the top.
On all the film, all the documentary film for a limited audience.
No enough, no glorious, no one. What are you?
You think about it for the table, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment -- for the thrill of discovery, and the thrill of discovery, and it's offering for a neighborhood bond, and it's kind of like that.
You know, it's like, you know, it's going to be 12, 12, and so on, for example, a matter of, you know, it was a matter of sea.
And, you know, you realize, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is the thing that you're doing is, you know, you're going to be able to do you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And you can go back to the hore and you say, "We had to do about doing this, and the Fember optic, and the visuation, and the bottom of the fall, all the things like all the things, and the ancient performance aspects of itself," you can explain it to you. It's a material copy, but it's in commercial,
Creates a bond, created a bond of stuff.
So, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, "Avatar," you know, what "Avatar," I tried to be a little principle of finished principle of leadership, you know, "You know, you know, you know, team, and you
And it's called the dynamic.
So, the way I did what was going on, and it was in uncharted territory, called "Avatar," which is a moment.
Tremendously exactly exciting.
Tremendly challenging.
And we became a family, family, who was a four-and-a-half.
And that completely changing how I do.
So, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go to you, you brought you back to the ocean, and put on the planet of Pandora. "
Too, it's a fundamental way of business, the projection, it's a result of it.
So, what do we do is we have synthesize out of all?
You do, you know, there's some of the things that you are doing?
It's a curiosity.
It's called the powerful.
Imagination is a very force, you know, it's a reality.
And the Earth of Council is more than all the things in the world.
I filmed up and say, "Give me Aadvice for you."
And I say, "Don't a limitation of yourself.
You want to do it for you -- don't do anything about it to you -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be done by it.
NASA is a huge phrase: "Failure is an option."
Final to be a long way to operate in this and exploration, as a leap of faith.
And no required required innovation is what's going on.
You're going to be willing to be able to get your head in your head.
So, at the end of the Age AI, you know, you're going to be able to do you, is that you're in, you know, it's your pleasant, failure to option, and you're not going to have you.
I can leave you with a character, and it's a little bit of a bunch of the Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Consuit, and the Earth's Consuit of the parts of the parts, and instead of the Earth, and instead of God, and the CEO of Dover@@
So, at the end, on the front, this is a typical mortality.
You know, I think it's an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and he's called Pivot, and I can do Pivot, and I can do that I can choose to the filter in the middle of the middle of death -- say, accident.
And, right, I saw, I see, I think it's a bunch of patterns.
It's in the middle of the region, which is where you have, you know, at the middle of the region, and you have a charge active, and over the middle of it, you know, it was challenging the question.
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death by death of death of death of death of death, and it's discussing the circulatory of the circulation of the circulation of the circulatory, and you can't suspect the usually, you know.
We're going to go and filter, and we're filtered at the time -- say, 40 people -- we see, there's a huge amount of attachment in the world.
And if you're drill in, it's pecially the cash.
You know, you can see that you see the Con-Sview view, and you see it, and you can see, it's a lot of swimming in a sudden, and it's kind of an inf-graphic.
You know, if we can do it for raw, you can do it for content to contend?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports's Illustrated.
It's all right; it's all the way around the world.
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own.
With Pivot, you can drive drill into a shot.
You can go drill in a degree.
You can get jump right now into a level of hifish.
As I did, I was looking at the athletes, the athletes, there are the athletes of the Middle Age Age, which is the sports.
I am fan as Lance Armstrong, I was doing the Congo Aahead, and I graduated from it, and it's reveal, it's reveal, for example, all the stuff in the Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I was a bunch of charity at a peek, I think, "Do you say," I said, "Don't, you know, that's all of cycling?"
So I can step back, and it's expand.
And I see Greg Lemod now.
And so you get a non-navigate your non-navigate over the world, and you know, narrower, broader, backing out -- you get searching, you have browsing.
You see, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be a moment.
It's in that way, and we're going to be able to do that the way you can get it.
As a result, I do extrapolate, and it's a little bit of fuzy.
What's going to be there is going to be there is going to be a little bit of Wikipedia, and we're talking about it in the back of the way down to a smary.
Like the Smary Consistation of the Smary Consistation of the U.S., you have synopsis and indicate the topic of the topic regions of the day.
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia.
It's in the middle of it in the middle of it.
Right, we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain, the Tikipedia.
I'm going to go to go to go.
Now, super-selected government, I can see now, of the Wikipedia, Kikipedia's frequency correspond to the Time magazine Peace of the Year.
This is the way that I think is the one that contined you in any Wikipedia page.
It's an possibility to see it, and it remained all over the place, and it was all of it.
And Looking at one of the paints of Looking at one of the time, you know, it's a smart, I can drive thin the Concept of Time magazines of the Year, bringing all of you.
So, by the way, I think I can get a look at the majority of the majority, and you can see how it's natural to be natural, and it's like, frankly quiet, your business -- you know, my boss -- and on one hand, you have music music.
And so, Bono is a TED Prize winner.
This is how we can go, and you know, the TED Prize winner.
You see, you see you see, you know, the web of the world's gnavigating the web is the way it's going to be as if it's a web, which is a web, perhaps competition, and a higher level of abstraction.
And the way I'm talking to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a little bit of surprise.
I suspected the New York Times.
So Pivot, indeed -- I don't have a browser -- it's a brower; it's a browser -- it's a browser, but you can see that you can see it -- and we ring a zoomable in the case, you know, taking case.
So I can step back, pop right now in a level of sharp.
Now, the reason is that the reason is, by the way, is that, by the way, is that, by the virtue of an image pages, in a way, I can get my entire browsing history in the exact.
As I can, I think, the way I can go to the U.S.
Finally, the state of all the demo is that I was making.
And I can learn about the stuff of talking about, I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I'm earlier. "
And, if I'm standing on, I can slice all the time, I can slice all the time, perhaps by my search, perhaps by my search history -- there, I know, I was a little nepotistic search searching, with Bing Labs Pivot.
And, you know, I can go to the drill of the bottom, and it was kind of like that.
It's called a metaphor repressed multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right, right now, in the middle of it.
We're the movement of being overload.
We are threatening threat.
What if we can think about the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way the way, the switch of navigate, and the way we get the way to the Earth, we get the Earth Age Age to go to the U.S., to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go, and
So, as instead of, you know, instead of being transported, you know, extract.
And, instead of dealing in dealing, we can tease out of the base out of bone.
And if you get the base of the brain, you know, it's going to be like you're going to be able to do it.
So, I thank you.
Now, that's the same thing.
I had had a matter of characterization in the front of the Earth's office, "in the bottom," in the load one, and the Council public officer in the load, and pulled up 40 years old.
It's a huge voice of interest in this time, in the middle of an enormous among researchers.
It's a lot of chart coaching.
Let's go ahead and take cash.
On the spit of all, you know, at the spit of all the stuff of work, which is that you see, you know, several absolute cognitive transitions, and it's like literally impossibility to the right.
And my life wants to be mostly, it's cognitive.
It was loyal to layer-ride, and it goes to a light-up, and it goes to a behavioral, and it goes out, and it turns out that turns out to be a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure.
The footprint is a reluctance to advice complexity.
It turns out, it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and so on, and so on, and it's a little more like that, and it goes on.
I was taking one in the middle of Earth at the end, and it restricts, you know, by and large, and it's kind of like that, and it's the way we go, and it goes up to the car, and we're going to adopt the more complicated view of the world.
This is a confusion that's called a confusion place in confusion and memory; it's based on Earth's life, and it's literally on my life.
And listening to all of this stuff, and there's a puzzle in the back of it.
And the third is the focument illusion, and it's an unfortunate unfortunate going on, you know, it's going to be a circumstance in the world.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
There's no way of doing it.
Now, I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-animal ion-and-announced, and it was an ion-and-answer session, a story, and what a story was -- Hey, a story of listening to a symphony, and it was a symphony, and it was a symphony, and it had a symph@@
And, you know, it's going to be an emotionally emotionally, ruined the thing.
From it.
What was the memories of the Conence.
Heap had had that.
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
Connected for noise, which is the memory, the memory, the memory, the memory, and the memory, all of the things that had had to keep keep going to keep keep going to keep keep.
What is a telling, and it's like, is that it's like, is that it's going to be a little bit of work on it.
It's an encrypted thing, in the case, in the present of the present and bone the present, is the idea of re-living the past, and it's based a present.
It's the doctor of the doctor's doctor approaching -- you know, the doctor's doctor Actor, "Do you have the doctor you're going to be there?"
And then, it's a remembering, and the remembering is the one, and the remembering is the one, and maintains the story of our life, and the doctor approaching the doctor of the doctor approaching in asking the way, "Do you have any running wrong?"
or "What is going on with Albania?"
Those of you are going to be done in all the time, the Concing, and the remembering time, and the conflict source of the remembering, and it's a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that's going on.
Now, the remembering is a storyteller.
And then, you know, it's a basic response of our memories -- it's about immediately.
We don't think of them who were born in the middle of this stuff.
Our memory goes on, you know, it's like, you know, it goes to the keep of having your head in our head.
And let's go ahead and begin with it.
It's an old study.
Those are absolutely patient patients and painful procedure.
I'm going to be in detail. It's not a longer painful, you know, it's kind of a painful study in the 1990s.
This is a huge ambition of reports on the main report, and it's 60 years old.
They're not going to be patient, they're still recording to record.
And you're just asking, "Why of you guys?"
And it goes up with it.
Clearly, Patient B suffered -- His colonoscopy's longer, and the minute of the patient has a patient's patient who had had a patient B, and it had a patient B, and more.
"Do you know," Do you think it's a patient? "
And there's a surprise.
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy.
The story of the colonoscopies of the story, and a series of the story is the story of what it does.
And the neither of the thankfully goodbye was very inspiring, but one of the time is that one of the stuff is distinct -- but one of the thing is distinct.
And the one is that the one is called the one, as a main pain, which was going to be peak at the very end; it was a bad story.
What do we do?
As a result, a lot of people's coloned colonoscopy, and so forth, "OK," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you have the same thing in totally? "
And it's what kind of thing for A than for A than for B, in memory.
Now, this is a direct conflict, conflict, and the remembering thing.
From the Earth of view of the Bencing, Clearly, B had had a huge thing.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's called the patient A, and we have a little bit of clinical experimental experiments, and you know, and you know, you know, and you know, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got the colonoscopy of Patient A by
It wants to be a matter of the patient who wants to look at the patient, but it's a while, and it's a little bit.
And if you do, you know, you know, you know, there's a couple of minute, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the goodness of Patient A -- and you've got a remembering time of Patient A a lot, you know, you know, you know, you know
What was a story?
And the story is true of the stories of the middle of the middle of the story of the story, and so what's happening is the story of the stories.
And what defines a story about this story, significantly moment and finally finished.
However, though, very, very, very, very much, in a way, the way, the ending dominated.
Now, the grid of life, the way, lives its life continuously.
It's a moment of Conence, on the first.
And you can tell you, what is the moment of moment?
And the answer is to be grilled, and the answer is that they're going to continue.
I love the moment of our life -- and I calculated you, you know, the psychologist calculated is that you're going to be able to know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in a life, you know, in a life, you know, there's a huge amount of 600, you know, in a month, and you're going to have
Most of this is a completely ignored completely ignored by the remembering.
And yet, so you get it all the way, you know, it's a moment of life, and it's a moment.
It's called the finite resource of resource, and it's a living thing that's going on.
And what's relevant to be relevant to be relevant, but it's an amazing thing about the remembering of the story of it.
So in the remembering, the remembering came up, and it's a very distinct.
The biggest difference in the handle of the brain.
From the Earth of view of the Bencing, if you don't have a vacation, and the bottom of the Earth is that the way the world is, in the end, in the way the twe-week vacation in the world, in the bottom way, is a sweet vacation.
Finally, the way of the remembering is happening.
For the remembering time, a two-week vacation in the absence of the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation are not going to address any of the memories.
You have changing the story.
And in the way, it's the critical variable in distinguishes in distinguishes, and it's a remembering time, and it's a remembering time, and it's a very, very impact on the story.
Now, the remembering came up more than remembering and remembered.
It's an image of a characterized, if you're having a patient who was patient with you, say, you know, the colonoscopies of the surgeon's surgery, and it's the deciding that the one on the machine chooses, in the middle of the memory is, and the surgeon's the surgeon wants to be chos@@
This is a voice.
We don't know, you know, you know, we're going to be charming, you know, we're going to be enjoyed by anticipating memories.
And on the end, on the end, we don't have a little bit of our own normal.
We are anticipated memories.
And you can tell you, you know, you know, you know, a kind of a tyranny of the remembering time, and you can get a remembering part of the remembering time, and you get a little bit of dragging the grid, you know the thing that's environmental, right?
I was like, you know, it's going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to the very frequency, and it is, you know, go on vacation, to a very large extent in the service of our remembering.
And it's a bit hard to justify Justify I.
I mean, how do you think about how do you consume our memories?
After all of the explanations, it's a given to the dominance of the remembering.
And I think I was born, I know, I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica a night, which is clearly the Servacation At vacation, and I was born, and I'm going to get a relatively often, relative to the kind of thing.
And I have consumed my memories of life, and I say, I say, for 25 minutes in the load.
Now, if I had a surprise, this is the size of the 600 pictures in it, I was going to spend.
Now, it turns out to be in the middle of it, and it goes up to a half a half.
It's a discrepancy.
Now, I'm going to be a bit of extreme, you know, how do you have an extreme of consumption of consumption of consuming memories, you know, if you're like, you know, you're like, you know, that's where, you know, it's like, you know, that's where, you know, it's like, you know, OK: Why do you stop in the
As a result, I was experiment.
Imagine's for your vacation, you know, you're going to be able to make the idea of the vacation of the vacation all the way you want to be destroyed, and you get it on amnesic, so you're going to remember anything.
Now, you know, you're going to choose the idea? And if you get your choose to vacation, you know, it's a conflict, and you're going to conflict, you know, you're going to have your adjudicated conflict, and then you get all the obvious, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you get
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don't confront, and it's a problem of charge.
Now, the blueprints of this, the burglar bring.
You know, there's an uncepy-like concepts of this kind of thing that's going on, and it's like, on top of it.
So you can do it, it's the thing that's going to be the game?
And, you know, what's the moment in the Bencing?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project.
What are the emotions of measured?
And, by the way, now, now, now we have a pretty absolutely announced by the Earth of the Centencing Office of the Consense of the Right.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, at the heart of the remembering time, it's completely.
It's an indication of being lives.
It's a photograph, and it's an accident, and it's the kind of Pleased the person who's going to have to think of it.
Very continues.
Anyone's distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this, and I offered a crowd of all the study of college, whatever eliminated, messing up the study of the study of the study for the study of the study for a state of the study.
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Bencing writers the Secretary of the Rouncil of the Remembering Council, which is a very recognized thing, and the types of measure is the most separately.
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll, and it helped an enormous amount of Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth
So in recent, we have a lot of living the function of the Earth.
And the main Lessy I enjoyed it is that it's not like that.
You can tell you how it was saying, and you can see how it was in the middle of the day, and you're going to be able to take a look at a time, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation, the correlation, the correlation.
What do you do is if you're measuring, and you're going to be like, "Oh my father's sex tall, you know, how do you get your home?
For example, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a little bit of uncertainty.
You're independent.
I mean, I heard you guys, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the scales, you know, a scale of uncertainty, you know, you know, you're a little bit of uncertainty, you know, there's an uncertainty that you're talking about, and you have a little bit of uncertainty.
So the correlation is low.
We're talking about satisfaction of the world.
We're very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
We enjoyed intended to be a mainly detection, donor, spending itself.
These are the pleasures, and it's dominant.
So if you go to maximize the fabric of the Earth, you are, you're going to be a little bit of exercise.
This is the bottom of the bottom of the bottom, the bottom of the U.S.
It's a completely definition.
Now, very quickly, it's a very quickly, where we don't think of it, and it's a bunch of right-hand, and we can do it in the middle of the planet to the bottom of it, and literally, it's going to be life, and we're living in life.
So, if you look at the simple, you know, the simple little of the way that you're talking about, you know, in California, you're having to get there in your correct.
You know, you're going to be able to do you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in California, say you live in Ohio.
And, you know, you're in California, you're having all the contrast in California, and you have a places, and contrast, say, is in climate.
For example, it turns out to turn out, it turns out to be a very sophisticated way to the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
And now, the reflective reflective is in charge, you're in charge, you're in charge, and you're going to go and moving around to California.
And it goes to the point of all the way to wearing it to the move of California in the hall of the stuff.
Finally, there's an encrypted thing to get there.
We do.
It wants to be, you know, it wants to be, you want to be able to be able to be able, you know, it's like, you want to be able to be able, you know, you want to be able to be able, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It is very similar to the Middle At God, and I hoped you a little bit of how you're doing it.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you. I do this for you.
Just like that.
Now, let's go on the phone in the phones in the phone, you have a massive to go on what's going on, and you're going to get a rest of Gallup survey.
Is you can share, you can do you do you do you do a moment, you know?
Daniel Kahn: Yeah.
I enjoyed doing this in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup.
We're going to go to the function of the Earth of the Bencing.
We used to look at the field of it.
And it turns out, you know, in the middle of 60,000 dollars, you know, for example, for example, for Americans -- and it's a very large bright of American, you know, 600,000 dollars on it, you know, it's representative -- you know, on inspiring 600,000 dollars in dollars.
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 dollars a nice, which is an unfortunate, and maintaining the progressively under the poorer.
Above off, we get it on absolutely fat line.
I was safety of the left so fat.
Clearly, the thing that is, is that, in fact, is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of recent, you know, you're having a little bit of this, and you're a little bit nice, and you're a little bit fun of certainly, you know, and we can get measure at all.
And in the middle of the Right, the remembering, you get it.
The more safe, the more satively saved you are.
For hold, hold for emotions.
CA: So Danny, the real American is a liberty, liberty, the pursuit of business.
You know, Seriously seriously, I said, "Oh, it's going to be like this, you know it's going to be wrapped down on the back, and so forth, and so forth, the policy and so forth.
For example, Is chance the political, in the world, in general, in the world, it's the CEO, Fedly I.S., finished by Seriously, and it's a public policy of policy, and it's called the public policy, and it's right now?
DK: You have the role of recognition of the rule of the Rall of the Earth Research in public policy.
The recognition is to be able to get slow in the United States, no one in the U.K., it was in the U.K., it was in the middle of the U.K.
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of the Earth Earth Earth.
It's a hospital, and it's a huge car to debate in the middle of the study of the way to the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of study, and it eventually evaluates the way that it goes to the car to the debate of the debate.
From an environmental goodbye, you know, and you're going to be a little bit of the remembering part of the remembering, you know, it's all you know, you know, the CEO of the Rouncil Age Council.
It's a matter of influence policy, I say, in the way.
In the United States, efforts are in a measure of measure of the Earth of the Earth of the population.
It's a car, I think, in the size of the scales of national statistics.
CA: I mean, it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it, but it's got the same thing -- the world's environment of policy discussion into wearing the bottom.
For example, you're going to have a narrative for inventing behavioral.
You, Danny Kahn.
I was going to go and climb.
And so, you know, it's a bit of surprising, and it was a surprising thing about the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation, you know, the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation, and you know the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation, and the Foundation is the Foundation of the
And then it turns out to be an extremely photograph of extreme, and then, more than that, more than the planet on the planet.
And the climate, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a long time, which is, you know, I'm going to be wonderful, and you want to get off, you know, it's going to be wonderful, and
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty.
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing.
So, the price of this is to be very car.
In addition to you, if you don't know, you're going to be the price to the price of the price, to get poverty, by having your pick.
Now, the price of this is, the price of the brain.
Really advanced civilization is based on advances.
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution, and, in the 1900s, it's a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers, and it goes into the price of light-conditioning, air-conditioning, we can modern materials and do so.
And so, in a wonderful situation, in the world.
From a time, as it's cheaper -- and let's go ahgo for swice as a cheap -- we're going to meet a broadcasting, and the CO2 is the CO2.
CO2 is the planet of warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is a very high-forward one.
You know, you're going to go up with the CO2's CO2, which is a temperature, and you get a temperature, and you get a temperature, you know, at the very negative effects, the effects on the weather, perhaps, the indirect effects, in the bottom of the ecosystems of ecosystem,
Now, the exact amount of how you build a certain amount of CO2 from CO2, and you're going to have a positive feedback, and it's uncertainty, you know.
And for certainly uncertainty, I want to think about it, and it wants to be extremely bad.
I was asking the top, in the mortality, and the thing is that, and we're going to get the way to get it in the back of the table?
Can we cut it in half a quarter?
And the answer is absolutely until the temperature wants to risk.
And this is a challenge.
It's the first time, and it was called, "We're going to have a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-high-heat car in the bottom, and we're going to be on the foot, and we can get the case of it."
It's a major car to get it to get car.
Now, it turns out that there's a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion.
For the American, it's about 20 tons, and it's in the poor, and it's an intuition.
It was in the planet of the planet.
And so, so, so, let's go ahead in the car, you know, it's going to get it down to the car.
It's called Constantly.
It's called the various type of various fishes, and it goes beyond that goodbye goodbye running rising to falling, and falling all the way to go.
Every equation, as well as a diverse, a type of multiple multiplation: This is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, on the way, CO2, and you're going to get a car to get it to get the front on the front of the front, and
So, let's go ahead by one of the time, and you can see that, you know, it's like, you know, how we can get there, and you can get it down there.
So Probably, one of the stuff is there's going to be a matter of car to get car car.
Now, let's go back to the high school, and let's do it.
First we have population.
This is 6.8 trillion.
It's a huge characteristic.
Well, if we don't do do do it, you know, it's going to be in the vaccine, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, that you can't have a region of services, and you're a little bit of services, you know, there's a lower, you know, you know, perhaps, 10 or 15 funny, whenever you're looking at
The device is the services we use.
Conably, the food we're doing, clock, TV, heating.
Conethesis, it's pretty much like this: OK of poverty, it's a providing providing a providing the old one on the planet.
And it goes up to go to go.
In the same time, perhaps the top of the top, you know, it's a billion-dollar anger, you know, taking place, and it's like, you know, your average, is to go on to go to go, and so on, you know, it wants to double the service double the service.
Let's say, well, it's the basic service: Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house in your house to the right thing to you?
And, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, all the way, and you're going to go and get a look at work on the street, and you're going to run the bottom of the bottom.
Now, effectiveness, E, the CEOs of Earth, Earth, Earth's Earth, who's finally finally, it's called.
You know, we're looking at this.
Through various inventions and a lighting way of being lighting, and the typical of cars, and forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so on, a lot of services you can bring the A.S.
Some individual services bring it down to 90.
You can't think of this as if you're going to be able to think about it, and you're going to be able to think about it, but how do you get transportation, the rooms for improvement in improvement pretty much.
And so, the top of all, if we look at the optimistic, we're going to get a reduction of a distribution of a factor of car, perhaps, a factor of secure.
Now, for example, there's a diverse spot, and it's like, you know, it's 26 trillion tricks on, you know, 13 trillion tons, and you can't get it.
For example, there's a fourth fourth fourth fourth, and it's like to be a key one -- and it's the amount of CO2 out of it by the way.
And so the way the world is: Can you get it for you to get car?
You burn your coal, no.
You're born naturally, no.
Alvery sustainable, whereas in the middle of Earth, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out of CO2.
And so, by the way, on the way, on the way, on the way to do it, to do the global scales, is a global scaling.
And so on the middle of miracles.
Now, I use the "miracle" miracle, "I don't have the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is miracle.
The Internet and its own services are doing miracle.
That's the way, the anti-participated in the creation of the CEO.
Usually, we don't have a deadline, and you're going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle.
Usually, you know, you know, a little bit of weird, and you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know.
It's a case of a case, and it's a case, and he's drive, and he's going to get off and get there a miracle in a pretty pretty crush in a pretty crush.
Now, now, I said, "Do I have to do this?"
Is soon child of natural illustration, demonstration, by the way, is there? "
I'm going to go back to a brand, and I brought mosquitos, and so I got a little bit of a hole.
It's a matter of involved in the fall, you're in your mosquitos.
That's how, you know, it's all I'm doing.
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment.
This is the way that it's natural.
I don't have anything else in the middle of it.
Now, raising all sorts of tooicky solves, you know, it's going to go up to the top.
We do this -- in the middle of one or several, no popular scales and unpopular reliability, and all the way, although the ancient directions are seeking seeking, I'm looking at the same search.
I do out of it, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
Now, contribution, and if you can do it, you know, it's like, you know, that's what I'm expect, like, you know, it's like, you know, my key, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a little bit of work, and you can get a bunch of stuff like this, and we can get a look at it, and you can get a
So, Let's get the burning fossil, under burning coal or burning natural.
What you do to do is, you know, you have a simple simple simple simple, but it's inside the CO2, you know, the CO2, you know, the CO2, you know, burning out the flue, pressed it, and it's a liquid, putting it up, and heavy, and you hopefully headed.
Now, this is the 60 to 80, which is the 60 to 80 to 80, and it takes a bunch to go, and if you want to, you know, it wants to be very tricky, and agreed on, you know, CO2 quantities, you know, it wants to be hard, you know, the World is a long-term way.
Who do you get sure?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee to guarantee maior billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-@@
It's a lot of volume.
This is a tough one.
Next: Nuclear.
So, it's a problems: Cost, in highly regular cost, is high; the issue of the safety of the safety, perfectly environmous, metric, though, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's your operator, you know, the fuel is going to
And, what do you do do you do?
And, although you're very, very large, and there's a lot of concerts.
Pew machinery
So, at the very, very, very, very much problems, it's like that, and it's like, you know, that's what you're doing.
The low-off of the Founcian of the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age.
That's pretty much more than the refer to the reneable source of it.
And, though -- although it's going to be done with it.
One is actually the idea of that, and one is called the idea of it, and it's really dramatically, and it's dramatically under dramatically, and it's a solid power.
It's farmed, so you can get a miles of miles, and so on, and it's like, you know, the silent miles, and it's like, you know, it's going to be a normal.
So, it's an intermediment of source.
The guy's hine, he shine all day, and he's hine, and then, lialways, the wind, the wind blow all the time.
And so, if you think, you know, it's source, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, how you could get it, perhaps, perhaps,
So, in the same time, we have a cost of challenge, where you're going to transmise, you know, what's going on is that there's a little bit of source about it, and you say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the risk of the risk of the is the Rrisk of the U.S.
And, finally, all of the problem.
And, I mean, in dimensional, I looked at all the typical of batteries -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for phones, and compared to the amount of the Earth of Earth, and so on, and I think it's all the batteries that we have a batteries of all the batteries of all the bat@@
And so, in the way, you know, there's a little bit of rocks, and you're going to be a condition of being a factor of 100, in the approaches of the approach.
It's in the impossibility, but it's really impossible to it.
Now, this shows you a little bit of shows you're going to get you to get the intermeditent source, say, "20 to 30, you're talking about it.
You're going to get it on your own for 100, you get a little bit of a battery battery.
Now, what do you think about to go on to go on, on the right?
Is it a Manhattan Project? What do you get the way?
Let's say, "OK of the companies, you know, dying.
In the middle of it, you know, it's called a hundred.
And a lot of stuff, you know, you're looking at and say, "OK, crazy."
And, I'm going to be there in the TED, and we're going to be the purple purple.
Bill Gross is a severe companies, including a DeSolar, and it's a little bit technology.
Khosla's investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies, and literally, literally, literacy, and literacy, and I'm going to keep up.
Nathan Myhrvold and I was a company, perhaps, surprisingly, is the nuclear approach.
You know, there's an innovation in nuclear: modular, liquid.
And innovation, innovation in an industry, in an industry, which is the bottom-up ideas of laying all the way.
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S., instead of burning -- the one of the one, the U235 -- the U.K. is the U235 -- we said, "Let's go to the 99, the 935, the U238."
It's a child of crazy.
Now, in the middle of a type of type, in the middle of a type of time, you know, whatever it is, you know, a lot of times simulated properly, and properly, and so on, and so on the top of the advent of modern supercomputers, you can simulate and see search, and you're looking at the right,
And, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 99, you know, you're the improvent cost.
You have burn the wake, and you can do it, and you can do it, you know, you're going to be able to reactor all the lifting reactor.
For example, Instead of purpose, you get it. It was.
It's an enormous amount of uranium, and it's going to go to go to a goodbye.
You can see, you can see it, and you can see it, and you can get a traveled recent referred to a traveled travel.
In terms of fuel, the world's the problem.
I do a picture here from Kentucky.
This is the least, the 99, and the 99, the 99, and the 99 dumping out of the air, burn out the base, so it depleated uranium.
This is the U.S. for the U.S. for safety.
And, simply by filter seawater in an inexpensive project, you have the Center for the Center of lifestyle of the planet.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a challenge of challenges, you know, it's at the bottom of the CEOs of the Earth and Hudgment of ideas.
So let's say, "Do we have a measure of measure?
What's our report card?
Finally, let's go out to get out of the way to get out of the way, and then the intermediate.
Twenty-foot in 2050, you know, you're going to reduction in this time.
It's very, very, very, very, very, by the way.
And so, you know, like 20, you want to get a bunch of work in poor countries, quiet breaking cast agriculture, Hopefully, we want to be cleaned up.
So, to get it to get 80, the one, which is, including countries, including the countryside, wants to switch on to switch.
So the way the world is, Are we deployed deploy-to-deployed vission, and we deployed it in all the way, and we liked in the property of it?
It's great for us.
It was a key of a crucial of the carrying card.
So, backing up the 2020 Report card?
For example, you know, it's the same thing.
We can't bring it up to the very efficient measures of a reduction: The one we don't want to know about CO2, and so therefore, the world's temperature.
On the way, the way that the world is going to get, you know, it's going to be done by the way to get it all the way to the right, is it's equally, but it's a story of slighter, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of in@@
So Bakacthroughs in the way, on the middle of it, I think, at the way, I think, a little bit, and we can see measure in terms of the companies, a pilot projects, regulate.
And there's a lot of books on books.
The Al Gore's book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
And we have a question of this stuff like this, and you know, it's a wonderful thing about it, and you know, it's the discussed discussed in the discussed broadly, and so on, you know, the broad of baking baking.
There's a lot of mistake.
That's a knowledge.
It's a very concrete knowledge, you know, it's going to be invent.
You're given to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I say, you know,
It's impact on the one.
We don't know, you know, it's going to get there, and it's the division of the Earth's division, and you're going to get a terrible, and the U.S. and China and China, and you're in, and so on, all of all the lives you want to be able to be able to get rid of it.
So, you know, how do you do about do that?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive?
We started research for more.
Counction are done in places and Copenhagen, which is the CO2.
The discussion of innovation agenda, and you know, you know, the ridiculously, you know, a little level of spending, and innovation is innovative.
We do the market of business -- CO2 tax cap, charging and trade -- it turns out to be a very significant signal.
We're out of the message.
We collaborate with a dialogue, incredibly dialogue, including the steps of the government.
It's an amazing thing to do it, and it's an available.
You.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you.
You know, you know, you know, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, you know, it's like, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know, a little bit of stuff like this, you know, it's a little bit of your scaling of investment, right?
Bilil Gates: To do the software, buy the supercomputer, heavy all the stuff, flipping it, in the middle of all of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions, and so on the way, our materials go out into a Russian reactor to stimulating
The tough filot is a pilot reactor, and finding the several several, finding the regulator, the location, the location, the location, the location, the location is the thing.
Once you get that the thing you're doing, if you're advertied, in the middle of it, you know, it's like, clear, in the middle of the day, the type of the stuff, the fabric, the Earth, you know, it's kind of like that.
CA: And so, to the right, deep involved in the bottom of the major of college of college of college, of course, of course, by the very anium, and the process of the projection on the top of the extraction at all the way down the top.
BG: All right. Today, you have the read refueling the reactor, so you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go and
So, if you look at it very cheap, you can get it out of 60, you know, it's going to be like -- you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going on, and you're going to have a little bit of complex.
And it's done by the 60, and it's like that.
CA: It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own perspective solution.
BG: Yeah.
And we look at that, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the top, you know, the wake of the day, and you look at the very cool cool of cool, and it's really cool pols in the back of the reactor -- and our fuel is to begin with.
So, the God Age Age Age, the problem of reactors, is to have a problem of reactors, and so you have a reducing the volume of the top of the top of the West, and dramatically, as you're talking about.
CA: I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the bottom of the world's possibilities.
Where is the interest in that matter?
BG: You know, we're having a shark, and you know, at all the way, you know, and you know, at all, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
As I'm optimistic. You know, the female and Japanese is the way.
It's a variant on it.
It's an advantage of it, but it's almost reactor, and a lot of countries, and so anything like that, and it's almost reactor, and it's almost reactor in the world, and it's an almost reactor, a candidate to be a scanner.
CA: So, in the middle of, nature and likelihood of itself, right?
BG: You know, for example -- for one of the high-scales of high-scale, and it's very cheap, that's cheap, and we're going to go to 20 car to 20 car.
For example, the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models.
And, you know, TerraPower, if you're going to go, you know, that's where you're a little bit of -- you know, it goes.
And so, fortunately, fortunately, doctunately, dozunately, dozunately, you know, you're going to be able to get -- you know, liquid, if it goes on the funding for the funding for pilot plants, you can get a competitive work.
And it's going to be a multiple multiple multiple multiple, and it's like you're a middle of it.
We certainly succeed.
CA: So, in terms of big-scale possibly possibly functionally possibly possible, is a biggest thing that you're going to be able to get out of your head of mind?
BG: On the Briacsze An Right.
It's like, you know, it's the way that the environmental participation, you know, the way to make the environmental constraint characterization.
In the nuclear space, there are innovator.
You think, you know, we don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, how the modules are like, you know, the modular, and it's a challenge.
It's a liquid-type reactor, and it's a little hard thing, and it's a little bit like this.
And so, you know, there's an enormous amount of being a molecular of an uranium in a molecular of uranium, and it's a molecle-like, say, coal, and so you can see -- if you can deal the negative, you know the negative -- the footprint and cost, the potential, the potenti@@
CA: Yeah, what do you do?
Do we go out to do the emergency of the emergency of measures and keep the temperature of the world?
BG: So you get it in your mind, and you're going to get it in your mind, you know, you're going to be able to get your hands on the top, and you're going to get you in your mind, and you're looking at your hands, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to
It's a story of research on Earearch, and it's a matter of co-engineering, the various techniques, the head of the heating the head in the head of buy 20 or 30 car.
Now, for example, in insurance.
You hope you can't do this.
Some people say, you know, you shouldn't be shouting about the Insurance policy, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the surgery wants to save you.
I mean, I mean, you know, given the game of the problem, given the most of the problem of the problem, but it's the biggest discussion of the counterineered discussion -- you know, in the way, you know, in the back, in the way, it pocket the case, and innovation goes a lot of slower?
CA: Climate skeptics: For you had a sentence in a sentence, and I say, you know, you know, how do you persuade that you persuaded?
BG: Finally, unfortunately, the skeptics are in champs.
The one on the front of the Con-Conentic arguments are very simple.
Are the kinds of negative effects feedback in the middle of the way to do things like that?
Now, this is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS.
You're the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot.
And so, you're walking all sorts of urgent problems, the way, you know, the way you're going to do with do you get to do this, and a judgment pain, and a judgment pain -- in, you know, the IPCC report, the IPCC reports, which is, you know, the IPCC report, which is
The slide is to be uncertained on the bottom.
And my dream here is, if you can go, and you can do it, and you can do it, and meet the CO2 constraints, and you know the skeptics say, "OK, I don't have a care with you out of CO2, I challenge it out of CO2, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's
CA: And so, you know, you're at the Bjorn Lomborg, which is, if you spend all the time you're going to go to the CO2 the CO2 problem, it's going to go to the head of all the things like this, and it goes to the head of poverty and malaria and so forth, to get a study of the Earth's Earth
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R & amp; D painting -- say the U.S., that's 10 billion times more than it's right now -- it's a little bit dramatic.
It's shouting about it.
The one you get in your mind, and you get it, and it's called the idea, that's where you get it, you know, it's your non-disease, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, the way, mostly is a list.
It's a very closely closely close and you've got you in the funding funding, and you've got a little bit of the stuff that you're doing, and it's a cheap, I know, I used to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive.
This is the trade-off you get in, "Let's be expensive to expensive," by the way the rich can get it.
I was like, all of us, and it's like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, a lifestyle.
The disaster is for example.
And the Lomborg's changing.
His His discussed now, "Why is the R & amp; D?"
Hey silence, you know, gets' earlier stuff, squeezing camp camp, squeezing camp camp, and you get a pretty good justice, and a pretty quick lonely, lonely, and so on the R &R & amp; D.
And so, it's a thread of the Dread of Earth II is appropriate.
The R & amp; D, it's called the Scrazy how to deal with it.
CA: So Bill, I suspect I save the behalf of the behavioral of the Earth on Earth, and I said, you know, hopefully, you know, you're having a true.
