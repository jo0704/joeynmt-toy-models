Several, Skillman's Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow.
And the very pretty simple pretty simple: teams of all the way to build the talling of the test, you know, the test, you know, the test, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, on the spaghetti, and one yard of tape, and one yard of dying, and one yard of a marshmallow.
The marshmallow hand is to be.
And, in fact, it's a very simple thing, and it's hard to pretty much depending on the collaborator in the pretty quickly.
And so I think about what was going on, and I incorporated it into a design key.
And so what a huge is looking for.
And since then, I makes 70 design designed across the amazing, and designed and architects, the CTOs of the Fortune 50, and the CEO of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortun@@
So, normally, it began to be an original type of organization.
On the way, characteristics out of the way they're going to be able to do it, and you know, you know, overwhelming power.
It's the way that you're planning to planning, organizing, it's like, you know, the sketch of the sketch.
The majority of the Conjority of Comembling the sticks into ever-toolly indeed.
And then finally, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's all the way out of the marshmallow, and it turns out to be, and it turns out, and it was like, and it stood up, and it was on, and it was a day, and it was a day.
For example, it's like, at the end of the day, is called the Tuh-oh, and it's called "Bh-oh," "The Bourn-up of the marshmallow circuit" collapsing "collapse."
So, as you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, a lot of stuff like that, you know, you know, you know, Moh-oh, and it's like, "Yoh oh," and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates.
Something, you know, cheat, map distracted and functional and so forth.
And of course, by the time, they're going to be done by the time, and it's a lot of times that there's a day, and it's like, "ta-da" worth, and the among the very recent graduate of the Congress.
And it goes.
At Peter tells us, perhaps the most processing thing that's happening to the test of all the way, you know, the whole thing that's happening is the way, the way, it's all the way.
So the way the things like this is, is that? Why? What is it?
And Peter likes to say, you know, none of the Middle Effoner, a CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
It's not a good job in the spinning power of this.
Between the way, you know, it's a very well.
And the reason is a bunch of business, trained to the sound right now, right?
And the execute on it.
And, by the time, the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top, call out of the mouth of it.
It was a crisis.
Right? Right.
What major do differentiates is the marshmallow, and a shared prototype, successive prototype, checing the marshmallow, white multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way.
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project.
And then, rather version, they get strong feedback, and you know, it's like that.
So the Lacity to play in prototype is essential, and let's take a look at what's going on.
So the average for the average is, you know, in the average, by 20 inches -- business schools, a half of them; lawyer, a characterization, you know, a downtown, kindergared, funny, evidence.
Who does this matter?
Architects and engineer, thanky.
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world.
And so, you know, that's what's going on, and it's like, you know, it's very sophisticated and self-pattering geometrical fatterns in the world.
So CEOs, a piece of an announcement, a little bit of the CEOs, and there was an average.
You put you on executive adminances on the team, the significantly.
It's called you, it's called you, you're going to go, you go, you go, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Win the way."
You can do it. You can get it.
It's called the killing of the skills of facilitation.
And there's a project that project the project.
And whatever, you know, team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team.
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong.
For example, you're going to be able to do it by 10, typically, you know, you're going to be able to get you, you know, you get the same thing that you're doing, you know, it's the way you get a little bit of a thing that's in the way that you're doing.
And I tried.
I do, let's go once.
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning.
So, how do you know, how do you get to be done with that, to design, design?
What does the rest?
For example, it was not a standing team.
Now, anyone had to say, "You say," Yeah on the bottom, "Do you have the price.
Like, isn't it? However stacking, staces, staces, stacks impact.
We energized the exercise on the exercise.
What do you do?
So now, the week of prototyping.
So this is the very, very, very much, the very way to do the same thing in the world.
At the tallest, the tallest in the least, the test of the brain.
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives and search.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a marshmallow, you know, you're a marshmallow?
And the reason is, I'm doing a process of processing tools and processing processing the cars of taking video, and it's a visual effects.
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day.
Frankly, frankly, it project a marshmallow, but it's like?
The callenge provide provides a shared, and a slide of a long time, a little bit of a purpose to the right on the right.
And so, you know, the value of the City of the City of the City of the exercise.
And it's like you're going to be able to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It's just a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of called the marshmallows.
Final by-step-by-step steps.
It's not a crazy deployment of the stuff that's going on, and it's all the way that's going on, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's going to be an additional system.
You know, there's an autonomous type of people who are there.
And the fundamental lesson, I think, is a design, design is a contact.
It demanded the way we bring it all from our sensory to the world, and then we got the very series of our own, and we got the very little bit of our own, our fellow and our case to the challenge.
And, you know, there's a prototype of the prototype of the story, and that's all the way to turn it into a type of type of type of type of moment to "tah" a "tah."
And that's a little bit differently.
All right.
Let's get a little predent right now.
A more machine, a cool, TEDish machine, and it machine, it machine.
And then you get it in the way to get it into it.
And you can go, you can go forward, you can go forward, you can't have you yourself.
And I wonder, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was boreful, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and you know, I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and you know,
I don't know, I think, to go to go to go to go to go to go back to the Congress, Twitter or Twitter "American Idol."
I don't know.
I was Convinced, of course, of pull to nostalgia, to knowing you.
And I do.
I mean, I was saying, I said, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say.
I don't have to go to go back, and it's called an adventurous way.
It's offering the possibilities of being planet, which is going to be done, you know, it's going to be done, you know, Congo, Congo.
As I do to get it in the machine, and I goodbye to go to go.
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the case, and it's based on a planet, and it's based on a case of messy, and it's a case to choose, and it's like, by the way, mobility, autonomous, declining rates of disease...
It was a matter of mind.
My great-grandparent died, all of it, by the time, by 60.
My grandparent pushed in 70.
My participation, my participants are great in 80.
This is how it was a nine at the beginning of my death.
With you, it's a bigger, and it's a bigger deal.
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi, excited to live exception to live in the world, you know, the world in the world is 100.
Think, you know, it's going to be done for that.
And does it happen?
Smallpox. Smallpox killed a billion-billion-plan.
It was reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way, and it was not a mistake.
It's called it. It's a Dvanished.
We vanquish it. Puff.
In the same time, it was huge, threatless millions of itself, which is a longer extraordinary, hardly.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio...
What do you do anyone do?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our ability to be fed billion of the CEO of the Centine method.
And to my mind, the Centfold method -- stuff out out, searching the way, by the way, it changed the way -- is an enterprise of Earth on Earth.
That's the way we look at it.
Infortunately, in all the way, all the things like this, and all the things like this, is a little bit problem, and it turns out to be the same thing.
And one of it is that all our accomplishments all our accomplishments, a trillion of goes to get to get hongry in your head.
This is a regime, and it's a very rapidly sharing, and it's a very rapidly, and it's discovered.
And then, you know, that's where our imagination to honor thoroughly drash.
Potal water, Arablands, rainforests, oil, gas, it's the way that it's done, and it's like, in fact, in the middle of it, and innovate, innovate in the way out, we have a moment.
So the thing is, Can we do? And I can do it.
I mean it was clear to be able to do it, it's going to be a matter of food, it wants to be a little bit of billions of domain, and it goes into the country, and it's listening to the country.
I'm going to be able to do power, which is it destroy.
I do it, and I don't know it's going to be in the way in the way.
Every one of the world's heavy keeps going on, and one of the Earth keeps going up with night: We're going to be progress in the Conence Age, and it's right now -- right now.
And so, you know, it's going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can.
We are the verge of amazing, and yet I've gone to go to go to go to go back to go, 300 people, the Enlightenment, to the British Age Age Age Age, and he was going to be a Congthesis, and he was going to be farmed with front of the anti-vigorsly, on more front
Peating wrap in the mind, and it's so ugly the way you can do it.
On the audience wants to go.
And, listening, contemplated with an opinion -- the Contled purpose of being progressed.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
You challenge your own. You know, you know, you know, Sorry, you know.
And hang out to characteristics.
There's a story, I wrote a story, Vaccine for The New Yorker.
And I think about it, I think, opposition to the opposition to it is, it's all of the world effective public about it.
I do to do it, I do, like, I wrote, I wrote a story, and I was a mobile.
And so, I wrote a story story, I wrote a story called the genetically engineered food.
Same one, more bigger.
Pew's crazy.
So I wrote a story about this story, and I couldn't do it, and I was pulling the Frankenes, which is called Frankenfoods, which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark, rather than a haphazard way, which passing up, which puzzling itself.
You know, you're doing it, I do it. I wrote the story, I was mobion.
I know, I was a journalist.
We type, we falled, we're dinner dinner. It was a case.
And thanthfully, thanthfully, I was born on, and I couldn't do some people out there, and eventually I do.
And in the middle of God, Congy mazes are going to happen to be fantatically going to be fantatically.
Same amazing thoughful, educated equipment.
It's also the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same.
And it's going to be a little bit of it.
As I do, you know, you're honest.
We ended up in the middle of this, and we did this, in the middle of Earth, Congress Congress, which is a relationship with progress in the world.
We do it ambivalding.
We're going to talk about it in ironic terms, "Congress."
Okay, I think that's what's going on for that, and I was going to be able to think about it.
We're going to read faith in an institutional, in authority, and it's in love, and it's a little bit of a reason we shouldn't go.
You can say, "You can say," Yeah, "and he wants to go.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass deeply, hanging.
You can, you can get you can do it.
It's a little bit of this stuff that's going on, and it's a little bit of the car in the front, and it's a little bit of skep-off.
Ask, which is, demand, demand is evidence.
Don't do anything.
So here, you get a little bit of this: you're going to get a little bit, you know, you're going to get your account on across the ancestor.
And the reason I can say, the idea is that, in an epidemic of the epidemic of being, you know, there's an image of the OK in the epidemic of the Simply, and you're in the middle of the Earth.
About 12, which is a story that was published, a horrible story, a horrible story, the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Ton of the study of this study is that what's true.
For example, tons of study like this, it's serious issues.
The job.
The bottom of the United States is called the United States, in England, Sweden, Ganada, and it's all the thing: no correlation, no one, none at all.
It's called it. It's a matter of matter, and it's a matter of character, we know, we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen, and you can do it.
We don't have a bunch of documents, and it's a government official, and I do, I know, I said I was doing all do.
You know?
The results of His is an amazing thing.
And Disastrous, this is a character: The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs of the Earth's vaccine rate for measles.
It's discovery, and it's an ashamed of Ahamed.
It was horrible.
What about a child of a child?
Now now, I do. I do it.
Do you see, you know, there's some kind of maps of maps?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles?
And there are very much.
Again, in fact, you know, you know, you know, that's where it's like, you know, it's going to be like 160,000 in the water.
There's a lot of death of measles -- 20 in hour.
On the heart of it, it's going to be done, and we can put it out of our minds, and you know, Jenny McCarthy can be preachingly preaching me, and Eilliteracy, "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."
And you can do that, you know, it's going to be able to get out of this, and it's going to be done in the left, and it's going to be a correlation.
It's not very much, though, that's the bottom of the bottom, but it's really the same thing.
And it goes up to that, and we learned it in a little bit.
It's a little while, Jonas Salk.
Heap of the situation of some of the crucial of some of them.
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.
It's a bad guy in the middle, which is how much.
His name is Paul Offit.
Hey hey, a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff.
It's called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning.
Pretty, right?
At the time, Paul's goes to go, and you know, it's a very vaccine, and it's like vaccine, and it's like valuable, and it's going to be like this.
And then it goes on.
So, Paul's Ana terrorist.
And Paul Department, which is, you know, the CEO of the Earth Swestified makes a lot of armed guards.
However, he asked him to go, and he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, she remembered him, and he remembered him to go to school, she remembered him.
And hold, Do Paul was vaccine.
I don't know, I don't say, say, vaccines are essential.
You see, you know, you have a disease, you know, horrible discussion.
We human measles in the world.
And it goes, and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtue of it, and it's going to be a little bit of it.
And you know, that's what the of measles are.
What's the polio? Let's go on. Why?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks, and it's like, I think, a little bit of a door.
There's no one.
She switched into the vaccine, you know, a polio, no way.
Fine.
Why? Are we going to get polio.
We're doing the polio in the world's office.
Today, I don't know, there's a guy who's going on a planning in Lagos in Lagos, and he's going to go to LAX, right now, right now.
And then, you know, there's a bunch of hours in a couple of hours of hours, and you get a car, and then you get a car in the car to the Long Beach, and then you get a little bit of a little bit of fabulous TED dinner.
And then, you know, there's an infected of an infected, you know, it's a paralytic disease, and we don't know, you know, it's all the way that the answer is the answer.
And the planet is on the planet, and it pretty much predent.
Now, let's move forward in a time. We're doing about doing this.
You know, Everyone's vitamins in the morning?
Echinacea, a type of antioxidant to get you.
I have to do it in American.
So the stuff of the stuff, and it's called the stuff of alternative medicine, and as a result of it, as a result of them, how many times we look at the top of it.
This is all the matter.
By the way, the whole thing is that it's called.
It's like, you know, you're a little billion dollars, you know?
I'm doing you.
That's where it comes. Dark.
Why do we do? Why do we do?
For example, I was there, I was having a big charma.
We have characteristics. We don't know.
And we shouldn't go and look at the care of the stuff.
It makes a cruel millions of millions.
It was a cold in the cold of the cold of the cold and the soul-lying way to the movement of the stuff of this.
So let's get it on it, and it's like, you know, what's going on?
We leave into the arm of Big Placebo.
It's a fantastic. I do Big Placebo.
You know, you're going to be able to do it, you know, it's a serious thing, and it's a nice thing, and we're spinning billions of dollars on it.
And I heard all sorts of things like this.
No of it -- gindgo, fresh; echinacea, frow; I don't have to have a case of mind, and we have a mistake billions of dollars on the dollars on the dollars on it -- it's fraud.
And you're talking? At you, I say, you know, I'm going to ask you, and I say, "What do you do? Let's do things like this.
It doesn't do it. "
And you're going to be there? You're wrong.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if it was the Eastern East HA of HHS, "Hmm, I found myself, I'm doing the Science of my experts on my stuff on my experts on my right," or simply, you know, scanctics quack to get a patient's coffee.
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
From up up to Thabo Mberki South Africa.
Hey killed 400,000 of His in Insisting and Garlic, and lemon and limon the antiretroviral press the antiretroviral of the antiretroviral of AIDS.
Hundreds of the Earthern Dutath-death, in a hand, has been plagued to be a plagued than any of them in the world.
Please, don't have to have no consequences.
It's pretty much.
Now, the model of mindly epidemic, in the middle of right now, it's a proponent of the proponent of genetically engineered food and the organic elite.
It's called idio debate. It's a huge thing.
It's a debate, and it's called metaphor.
It's an ideology, it's going to be done.
Every single crash, you know, the CEOs of rice, you know, the story of Parsley, the Brusss sprout a lot of you.
You think, you know, you're going to be the same thing in the garden of Eden.
You know, it's an anthoripe in the world. We're going to have a huge amount of christmas. We're going to happen with all of them.
We're taking over the lower 11,000.
And it goes and forth about it.
We're talking about the stuff.
Now, now we can do it in a more precise way -- and it's a funny thing, absolutely -- but we can put it in a lovely vitamin A into rice, and you can get stuff millions of times, millions of times, project lives.
You don't do anything like this?
I said, I don't know it.
We object to genetically genetically engineered.
Why do we do?
For example, the As Constantly constantly -- Too's chemicals, pestr, hormones, monoculture, we don't know, there's a lot of game of the game of the stuff that's going on.
We don't know companies patent life.
We don't have the companies of owning.
And you have my response to all of it?
Yes, you're right. Let's get free with it.
It's true, it's a huge food problem.
It's a little bit of doing it.
It's a bunch of patent on it.
You're going to be a company.
It was indeed.
It's in the middle of it; it's a project.
It's a profit, and it's a project like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, but the way the background is that the thing that we're doing, and whereas the thing we're doing is that the thing we call the Araid, is that the thing we call the Araid, is the very deader, and it was a little bit of prevent@@
You think, in the way 50, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be -- you know, it's going to be -- you know, there's about it right now, 70.
investment in Africa over the load 30.
Disgrubful. Disgrust.
It's going to get it, and it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be there.
And that's genetically engineered.
We don't have to encourage a study of encouragement, and we have a study stuff, so, in the case, Rassava.
Cassava was a bunch of hand.
It's a child of a potato.
It's a bunch of calories. It sucks.
It's called a protein, and it's protein, and it's protein, and the industry of industrial engineering, all of the things that are right now.
And then, you know, it's going to be able to be able to get there with a bunch of work.
You know, wouldn't you know, how do you get?
It's like, you know, it's wouting with Chez Panisse.
And all I can say, "Why are the thing we're going to shoot?
I do, let's go back to this stuff: Why are we going to be shaping?
Are we going to move the way to move?
It's literally, it's because it's a chemicle.
It's intensive to be ridiculous in hormones for hormones, our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment, or less food, meaning food.
You know, it's called the Rice Krispie, which is the key thing, and it's in characteristics, and it's in the middle of it, and it's in the middle of it.
You know, you know?
We don't know, if you're going to continue to the issue the way the way we're going to get it on the way we have a little bit of the AK, we're going to have a good thing about it, and we're going to be a good thing about it, and you're going to be a good thing about it, and you know, it's a great colonialism.
There are no way to get to the Council Resk.
It's kind of selfish, it's like, it's like, wherever you get it, and literally, you know, it goes up to it.
So, as a result, you have conversation, you're conversation, you say, "This, you're going to get a little bit of a little bit of this stuff in an amazing machinery, you know, go?"
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It stuck in the present right now, but we have a lot of amazing.
We can make a bunch of stuff on anyway.
We can move it on the line, and we can move it, and we'd like to move the way, on the middle of the day, and literally, to move it.
We do it conversations, and we're going to get car, you know, you know, you know, and you can get it in the machine, and we're going, and we're going, and we're going to go on ahead, you know.
I was going to do it, and as an amazing thing about being concerts, and it's right now.
You.
One day, Los Angeles Times Fehinist Steve Lopez, With Along the Earth Eong Bopez, who's going to be a downtown of downtown Los Angeles.
And the source of what you do, you know, African-American you, charming, bomeless, playing violin.
And I got a story about you, called the Steve, and Steve, the basis on the basis of a story, which turns out to be a movie, and a judgment of Robert Downey Ayers, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, and the Juilliard-trained double is a promising care@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard, he's going to go to a complete crash, and 30, later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve, and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond, you know, you know, you know, you know, what music heroes shape, bond, and ultimately instrumental -- if you're in pardon's pop -- you can get the outcome.
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, the Wold Disney Concert Hall.
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth, symphony, and it's going to be a little bit of crowdsource.
Hey, what happened to be a very young jovial and gregarious mobile, and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the Dodgers to go to the World Series, all the foreign violin casualties work in the lower movement of Beethoven, Fourth Symphony.
And we had music music, and I was in email to Steve, and I said, you know, OK, and I was saying, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, OK, and he saw a violin.
Now, I'm going to refer to Nathaniel refuses, you know, that's what's going to be recruited with, you know, therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and it's a stayed for him for his entire life.
There's a result of it, and it's a little bit of a schizophrenic episode, the worst of the Merophrenic Age, Earth him, and he's a very dea-voice of disappearing for days, wheling the street of Skid Row, exposed to its own, and the Toral of Horror of his own
And Nathaniel, which is a state of agitation, and he's going to go to the Walt Disney Concert, and he was born a child from some manic glass in Hall of the eyes.
And then I'm going to smoke invisible demand, and as the poisoning him in his sleep.
And I do what Araid, you know, you know what's Araid, you know, you know what's going on, you know, "Don't be a little bit of work in the state of His, and Beliet, I know," Mrink "Foice," Folin, "Folin," and AK: After all the scales and exciting,
Like, I was playing.
And I played the Concerto the Conethoven Violin Concerto.
And as I played, I was determined by what a project is called a profound of a project in Nathaniel.
It's what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceutic, and chemical reaction, for my plays music music, of catalyst.
And Nathaniel, manic a little bit of what transformed into a lot, a quick curiosity and grade.
And in a miracle, lifeline, at a middle of violin, by ear, certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of abundance -- birth, Tchaikovsky, Siberius.
And we have music music, Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B, the Bartók, all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the middle of encyclopedic, biggest music of music, but related to the neighborhoods of related to a music.
Hey, you spoke to the characteristics of the child of happening and a lot of hand, I hate, I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And playing music, and I had music, and you had a transportation of the paranoid, you disturbed the Earth CEO of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, and ended, brilliant, Juilliard-trained.
Music is medicine. Music changes.
And for Nathaniel, music is it.
This is a music allows, and it has to be a hand, and it has a huge and delush, and she shape a realm of creativity, and so forth.
And it's an especially hit state.
And I was determining what the very sence of species.
So, what the very reason is like to be in the moment, in the middle of it, in the first place in the very fundamental core, our emotion, and all of our major creativity, lies the creativity, we have to be a shape in reality.
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves, inspiring and unitable.
And for Nathaniel, he needed music breathing him back into a fold of term.
The redemptive power of music bought him back to a family of family behind him, and a narrow machine, and a narrow.
And I want to get a music of M.thaniel, which is the Wold Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, which is a neighborhood that I became a music.
You.
Bruno Giussani: Your you. Thanks.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I was like to play with you, I was hugely celebrating.
So, pleasures.
I Jane McGonigal. I did a game designer.
I've gone online now online, and my goal for the size is to go to the head to go to the head to get it to be able to see the thing in real life -- save the thing in real life in real life, and it's actually saying the way to save the thing in real life.
Now, I've got a plan for it, and the Convincing more, including all of you, including all of you, a little more playing more.
Right now we spend a little bit of a billion-playing game.
So, Some of you would be like, "From a moment, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a little bit more playing.
Magic, consider considering, considering that problems in the real way.
For example, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, which is the opposite is true.
Three hours of hours a week is not a little bit nearly a little bit more than the way that the world is intended.
In the middle of the day, I was born if the survival of survival the For century planet on the planet, in the car, in the car, it's a little bit dramatically dramatically.
I entered the Calculated the totally, 21 trillion hours of game.
So, at the end of a cool intuitive, I say, "Let's say," On the way it's going to be funny, poverty, poverty, functioned, global conflict, "While, I wished to go to the Adto Charge for 21 billion hours a week, by the bottom of the size
No. I don't know. I am.
Same.
So, Prancture pretty much fuzzy, and I said, "OK, I'm going to be very sensial to the Convival of the Convival of the Convival of the Council. Truly.
It's a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano.
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming, this is a camera camera in the front of gamers.
And it's a classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you don't have a gamer, you know, it's like you, you know, the way you're in the photo.
You see, you see the Age of urgency, you know, it's a bunch of stage, and you're a little bit of intense concentration, the deep focus on a taccling and a level of a problem.
You see you're going to be a gamer, you know, you want to be a nuances: the Crinkle of the eyes, and the Mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows up to the eyebrows.
It's a good-off of "epic."
Oh, you're a little bit of it.
OK, well, you know, that's the way that it goes in here.
In the epic, in epic, is so extraordinarily positive, you had nothing to do with the possibility of it.
It's an ancient hyond the threshold of imagination, and you get it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a little bit of discover, you know, it's
This is the epic.
It's a gamer on the verge of epic.
And on the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the U.S., to the top of the Earstacle of the East century -- the understanding of the Earth Council -- the face of the Age Council, all the odd, is on the verge of epic.
Now, unfortunately, unfortunately, is the face of the face of the face, which seems to be in that life, in the end life, in the face of now, in the end life, in the face of a day living in the face.
An the At At At Life At Life.
It's like, it's like, you see, it's like. Can you see you see? Yes. Good.
It's the "I Now Good At Life."
It's a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, I think of the P.D., I think it was in real life in real life.
And it's a problem, and it's a problem of it.
We're going to be able to do it in the reality that we're going to be in this.
I don't know how to do it in search, although, although, although, everything.
We do it in game.
So I think it's in motivated to do it -- inspred in collaborate and cooperate.
And on the way, you know, I think it's a matter of all the way, I think, the Moly-Dovered of Connectional -- the English of the English, the English, and the English environment has done a moment, the English, and the Enlikely to stick up on a problem with a problem
And in real life, in the middle of the face of the front, you know, the way we confront obstacles, you know, we don't see anything.
We're overhead, as we move towards, we're anxious, depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We're going to be a little bit of game, and we're going to be able to have games, which is in the middle of it.
So, I think I was a graduate student, I think, is a graduate student.
What do you think about the impossic to the people who do you get?
And so, can we do it, and it's a little bit of work on it, and it goes on to real-day work?
So I look at the World of Warcraft, which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment.
And I have a case to notice in the middle of noisy, which is so possible in online.
The Tustice is an enormous show you show me, on one of the time, especially in World of Warcraft, which is the pecial lots of character to character, and you're going to trust you a character, and you saw a little bit mission, right.
And there was a mission on this, and it's a mission that it's perfectly offered in the game.
Right? So you can do it.
It's a challenge you can do it.
With the version of it, it's a very definition of the way that you're talking about.
There's no insucyment in World of Warcraft; no searching, wrying, whinging, the series of the Sific and a half.
So this is the tons of collaborator.
So, Everything you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, the Hundred-sand, and all of this stuff, and you get to work to work in the middle of the story.
Eventually, in real life, in real life, which is our fingertips, and it's our fingertips in collaborator.
And the epic of the story, it's called an inspiring story of it, and it's like, and so on, and we get a little bit of positive feedback.
You're going to be a little bit of life at leveling, + 1 strength, + 1 intelligence.
We don't eat the child of constant feeding in real life.
Actually I do it, I don't know, you know, I'll get it in a time, and you know, I think it's a pretty thing, and a crazy, and 20 crazy.
I don't have to do it in real life.
Now, the problem with a collaborative online, the World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying into the verge of the verge of the movement of epic, in epics of epic, in epics of epics all the time, the decide to spend all our brains.
It's a reality of reality.
So, by the way, collectively all the World of Warcraft, you spent 5.93 to the virtual problems of Ashoth.
Now, for example, it's a bathroom.
It's absolutely asking you to do it.
Right: 5.93 in the context: 5.93.
It's the machinery of what the machinery.
So, as we like to think about it, as it's like, you know, it's going to be a little bit of the purpose, the way to do it in plaligate, the way to make it happen, as it comes to the car, as it comes to, is the magnitude by the magnitude of evolution, and that's at extraordinary.
So what's happened is that it's going to be done by taking cash, and by the way, by spending all the things that's playing with all the time, and so on the front of it, we're going to be able to get a little bit of ourselves in the world.
We trained to be a more collaborative and it's about it.
It's true. I do.
So, considers of the statistic, it's a statistic; it's researched by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young one, which is a source of gamer campaign, which is a huge metric to get 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours to spend 10,000
Now, 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time for that.
First of all, for example in the United States, 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school, which is a great deal with high school graduation, if you have a perfect breathing.
So, we're having a parallel track of education, and that's where we're going to be able to do it in a way to go, and it's a car, and it's a little bit of decreases in school.
Some of you have a Right Rad Malcolm Gladwell called Outlier, "which is how you have a theory of" 10,000 hours "theory," theory. "
It's based on a cognitive type of cognitive, which is, if we can build 10,000 hours of effortly study at all, and anybody at the age of 21, we want to be virtuosos.
We want to be able to do it, and we want to do it, do you do it.
And so, now, now in the middle of it, it was an entire generation of young, virtuoso.
That's the way, "What exactly are that?"
So, if you look at a little bit, you know, it's a viral unprecedented unprecedented, it's going to be resource.
This is what's going on in the world, and it's a day playing a day.
Consider virtuoso, 500 people who are extraordinarily at all.
And in the case, in the case, in the car, the reporting trillion is the extraordinarily addressed.
You don't do anything like this.
The game industry, the game industry is the way we're going to be able to do it, and the effectiveness phone networks of broadband Internet, so it goes all over the world, which is all the way that the Earth Offerarly in India, China, Bracil, can get it online.
This is the size of the Earth Earth.
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion.
So I think of the way, I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I think it's a virtuoso.
You know, it's the way that the world I'm doing.
OK, yours like this extreme self-motivation.
Usgent optimism is the desire to devotion of the immediately towards sevacle, combined, heavily heavy, and he would be a idea of search.
Gamers who have been done at epic win is the possibility of the idea, and it's at the end of it, and it's now.
Gamers don't know how to do it.
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time.
For example, this is a lot of stuff that's happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows, and it's a game, and it's a game.
And the reason is, it's a huge amount of trouble to play.
We want to be able to think about it, and we're going to be a bit of a bunch, and it wants to be a little bit of fuel, value, which is the game, and it's the game.
And so, plaza's game, bonds and cooperation.
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships.
Blissful Right. I do it.
You think, you know, at the average of the World of Warcraft games, you're going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half a half a table.
It's the way that it was going to be a game, and it goes behind it, and so forth, the beautiful animal is going to be a little bit of hard than we're going to be relaxing relaxy, or walking out.
We're going to be optimized as we're going to be optimized as usual, to do hard and meaning work.
And gamers are going to be hard work at work, whether it's the right thing to work on the right.
Finally: epic meaning.
Gamers's joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales.
So, this is a little bit of trivia that you're looking at, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you know, all of Wikipedia, pleasure in the way.
Second biggest voice in the bottom, which is the World of Warcraft.
So if you want to do this, Five is going to be done.
Now, compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody's topic covered at the bottom of it.
It's not a matter of epic.
This is the World of Warcraft's World of Warcraft.
OK, so, as well, it's going to be a power-power-power-powered, and you can't get a guy to go, and you don't have to be super-empowered hopeful.
This is not the case of individually, individually, individually in the world.
And the bottom of the problem is that, as a result, the whole thing that we have a little bit of changing virtual virtual, and the real thing.
For example, the problem of the problem of the problem of the world.
This is what happened to be named Edward Castronova.
His work is brilliant.
Hey looks at the end of the time, the investment of that invested in the first place so that it was so, and it's all the way to go in online.
And then, "We suspect," We suspected from the anounts to no one, but a mass exodus to virtual, online. "
And then, you know, it's like that, and it's like, it's like, so, it's like this.
And then, you know, you know, I'm going to be designed, I'm going to be designer; I'm exuberant.
For example, there's a perfect thing that can be done in the middle of the Earth's announcement, but it goes in online, in online, in real life itself in real life.
It's a non-threshold of relationship in games, in the way, and you can get it in real life, and you get a little bit more confidence, and you can get it in real life in real life in real life.
So, for now, for example, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect more, perfectly more than virtual words, than the real.
Now now, I was rational, for now.
Finally, by whatever it is, is that situation.
We car about the real work, which is a game.
I am inspiration, I think, is 2,500.
That's the case of this ancient, and it's a little bit of a sheep of sheep.
At the time we had had a bunch of awesome, we had had had a sheep sky.
And yet the very curious equipment designed in the first place, and if you had a family of the science of the science of the ancient Greek of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus, you know, you know, the story of that, you know, the history of the studied, you know, it's the history of an invented
Herodotus deployed, in the case, the olarly dense in the Kingdom of Lydia, allowed by the major of the family.
Apparants, what a severe family of Lydia decided was to do with do the crazy.
Petish suffering. Petish charging.
It's in extreme situation, and it's extremely solution.
So, according to herodotus, and you know, you know, you know, you know, it goes, and you know, this is a little bit of a crush, and you get a kingdom of policy, On one day, and on the one day, and on the way, and on the way, on the way, on the way.
And then, you know, there's so immerent in playing the dice, you know, that kind of games are that kind of gamp, and you've got to be able to get intensive, and you're in a previous case, Blissly, actual, in the middle of this, in the middle of ignore, and you're not going to have a kind of a
And then on the front one, and it's a bunch of time, and on the front, and on the front, you know, on the bottom.
And according to herodotus, and it passed 18 across, survival, a family, by eating on one day, and plays on the bottom.
Now, this is exactly, I think, how do it go.
We're going to get the real-up recent, we know, we gamined the way to get broken out of the brain on the real environment, in the real environment, which is a very satisflice real life, and literally, in the middle of the day.
With the way, you know, it's going to be a little bit.
It's an exciting thing.
According to herodotus, which is an 18 machinery of the name, which is that the science of science is a very decided divide.
Divide the entire cingdom.
It was a divided, and the winner of the winner of the Council of His on Earth goes to go on the epic adventure.
So, let's go back to Lydia, and the Contonland go on in search of a square listening to survival, on the resources, and Hopefully to the Scivilization of the world.
Now, it's like crazy, right?
For example, DNA evidence is a showing up the Etruscans, and the way, the way, to the Roman Empire, the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians.
And so, recently, intimate people, Modotus's crazy.
And then, of course, this is a global cool of a global cool, cooling plasted for nearly 20, which is explained the family.
This is what's happening to be true.
Now, it was a series of characteristics of games, essentially, in the middle of 18, and it's kind of like inspred, and you're going to get the same way to talk about it in the middle of the case, you know the entire civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're doing plays of plays. We're going on in 1994.
This is the Earth of Resk in the World of Warcraft.
This is what 16 was like.
It's a little bit of played at 18, we're going to play plays warm for 16.
I say we're going to be epic for our own.
Now, it helped suggest the civilization go out in search of a south, so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game.
Let's get a half-penetration of the old, and leads to a dinner bour, until we're talking about it.
Now, I said, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," I don't know, "Oh," Do you know, "I don't know how to do it in the end of the real problem?"
For example, I was devoted my work on the past, and the Institute for the footprints.
We're banner in our officer in Palo Alto, and so expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to the relative to the world.
We do it in a way predicting the way.
What's the car to do that.
We care about imagine the de-case of scenario, and as we go, and we don't have a reality of a reality.
We collaborated with imagine epic washes, and then, in the middle of the day, the epic goes up.
I was born to the very letter, I think, "I don't know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know,
This is the World Without Oil.
We're in 2007.
According to, you know, it goes to the surline where you're going to survive you to survive.
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you, and so on, you know, you're going to be able to do it, and literally, you know, live in your life, and literally, you know, live in the upper, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So what's going to be transportation is that if you're a transportation of closed, if you're a little bit river, and you're going to figure out how you're going to find your life on your life lives, and then you're just going to post you, to post videos, to pick up to a post video, to the post.
We pilots with 1.700 players in 2007, and we looked at the tracking of the Earth.
And I can tell you that it's a transformative thing.
And Noo wants to talk about what they're doing, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be the souosed.
If you're not going to have a lot of times in epic adventures, and you know, "We're out of oil.
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go on.
Challenge yourself see how you look at the survival, "All of our player's keeping up here, and he's gone, and he's gone.
So for the long-term goodbye, scientific light-banking, bigger problem in the world.
We did a game in the Institute for the Future.
And the premise what, a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet 23.
It's super-computers to the Global Extinction Awareness System.
We aspired online -- along a Jerry Bruckhomer.
You see Jerry Bruckheimer's movies, you're team -- you're the astronaut, the -- you know, the way the -- you get the way, the way, the ex-convict, and all of the things like this is to save the thing.
On our game, Instead of Down, and the roam team, we said, "Everybody on the turn test, and it's a funny thing to invent the funny of the Earth's Earth, the Age Earth, the Earth's Earth, the Earth of Earth, the Earth of Earth, the Earth,
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of a while.
On a time, 500 insanely creative problems of you can go online, Google "superverse," and the search.
So, finally, the load, we enjoyed drunching a march, and it's a game called the World Bank Institute.
You want to complete the same thing, you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator, class of 2010.
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa, and we're going to do very inviting innovation in that.
We're going to be a graphic given, we know, a graphic grid, we know, in skills in skills, whatever, bigledge, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
I'm going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you, whatever, in the way, Earth in the U.K., you know, the U.K., you know, the way, in the way, you know, the way, in the way, you know, the way, in the way, you know, the way to look at the bottom of the region, and
So, I'm going to go to Wrap.
I do it.
What do you do?
We're going to be a very amazing gamer, and we're at the time, and it's a little bit of a child of pilots, and it's like, you know, a little bit of pilots, and you know, none of the stuff that's happening.
I want you to do you want to get you, you know, you're going to be a resource, you know, it's a resource, you know, it can be a resource, and you can get it to do it, and it's a powerful platform for powerful platform.
We're all amazing powers: Blissly activity, the ability to voice to Wave a tight pabric, random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I'm going to hope that we're going to go to a little bit of domestic, you know, to survive on the planet for the survival.
You know, my hope, you know, you want to get join.
And I think I can go to the size of the Serventation, I think it's a CEO-E-E-Servation for Sure, which is that we can't imagine, and we can imagine, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and I can say, "Let's start the" following. "
You.
For example, the placebo was effect at the placebo effect, whenever you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a magician to a magician to a magician to a magician to a magician to -- you know, "Someform is a popular fake," Somek fake is a population of the matter
Now, in the way, suggest a measurable effect in certain, the placebo effect, the placebo effect, the stuff of the people are going to be able to think about it in a pharmaceutical or a pharmaceutical cycle, and it's -- for pain management, for example, if it's a measurable effect
Someforty-fake themselves, the real thing about this is a function of the Earth Ocean Earth.
In order for us, I was taking car of showing you a local, very simple magic.
And I'm going to talk to you show you show you how it works. It's a puzzling, and it's a puzzling, and it's a puzzling, and this is the 1950s.
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s.
I do it for you, and it was an explain it.
And as I explained, I explained it.
So, here's the way.
The knife, you can do it, you can do it.
I'm going to go to hold the knife in my free.
I get my sleeve back.
And to do his novelty, or my sleeve I had to squeeze with squeeze my wrying right.
As you can see, it didn't seem to be able to consider anything, as you can't see anything, as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like, you know, my sleeve, my sleeve.
And the object of this is very simple.
I do up to open my hand, and hopefully if all of the is well, my pure animatically wants hold the knife.
At the moment, you're going to be so tirely in the U.S. I can shake it, and the knees in the knee.
Noo goes up at my sleeve, no trickery.
Ta-da!
So, this is a population of a trick of characteristics of the way to work in magic, and you can learn a little bit of this, and you can see that it's a real deal with this, and it's a very simple one of the study of college, but it's a very simple trick of methodology.
Probably was a little bit of you in the world.
What's it?
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I do to grab hold, hold of my wrapped up to his novelty, or my sleeve, and it's a lie.
The reason I encountered the His of my wrist is called the Earth of the illusion.
In a moment, my hand models of moves, you know, you know, you know, you know, finger right here, my index finger is the way to shift in the head with a huge amount of work with a position of poison.
Nice.
Someone's bunch of Someone's a budhood out of it.
For example, it's going to go, and it's like, right.
And as I was moving, you know, my finger's finger.
And we have a characterized thing about this, you know, you don't have anything that you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the mine, the mind, the same thing, and the way it's a process of processing it, you're going to be able to identify, one, you know, it's like,
Isn't it? Right? And back, I open my hand up.
Obvisly with the inclinging thing, which is by animals magnetic, and that by Chicanery, my index finger.
And then, I close my finger, I would say, as a living, a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger.
I am hand on. You look at the knee.
It's a trick for you can do you can do you can do it, and you can do it in an industry. Thanks.
Now, does the placebo effect?
I read a study a study, and that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, I was a doctor or a researcher, so, to me, what was the astonishing.
It turns out, it turns out, you know, there's a placebo a placebo in the form of a Earth Pill, you know, it was called a round of a round -- it was round on it, and it's called a round on it, and it's called a round on it, and it's a little bit of measural effect.
If you look at the placebo, you would be able to get you a placebo, and you can get it in a source pill, and you can go and color it blue, and you get a hotter and stamp on a house into it, it's called the measurably more effective.
Even though, and Even though, one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical.
There was a blue pill, which was a blue pill.
What?
Turns out, though, you know, it's stops.
You have a huge amount of suffering, you know, more effective, more effective than tablets in any form.
A fellow colored, which is to say, "OK," Don yellow on the bottom of the slide, and it's on the bottom of the slide.
And there's a car to do it.
One pill is a pill of Pill, and you know, I don't know it's a statistic now.
It's the bottom...
And it's the way to do it -- it's the same way to do this.
And the form is a car to do it.
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo, you have to be the base to the needle.
Right? As a syrlege instead -- a couples of CCs of this, and you have a patient.
It's a powerful image to be a powerful image, and it's like chronger than the Earth Bill.
It's like, you know, it's called a graph, you know, "OK," OK, I'm going to talk about it, you know, you know, you know, "You know," You know, it's a little bit of slides.
This is an absolute pill, which is an actual blue pill, and it's an actual blue pill, which is an actual of the Blue Pill, which is an actual of the Blue Pill.
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it, and it's called a stronger thing to make it happen in a distinctive one.
I was taking place to see, I was taking place, and I was going to go with a magic trick.
And then, you know, it's Ovisly a fake trick, and it's just a little bit of it.
And we're talking about the study that you're talking about, you know, you're going to reality, you go to the needle.
It's a seven-and-a-half-inch, and it was very, very sharp, and I'm getting rid of the sterilizes on it.
This is the one of the stuff of the photograph. It's a Damian called ial-size.
For my skin right, it's a Hollywood ineffect.
I'm going to push my skin and run the ball of the ball.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know -- I do what's going on, you know, the Earth for the hotel
So, I'm looking for you guys, you know, you get a little bit of this stuff, and you're going to be with you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was like, you know, I was in the morning, I was a child.
You're going to get it to see, you can get your mind, you can get your mind.
So, here is the beginning of it, right here, the beginning of my mind at the lower, of my arm, I said, it was pushing.
I do, you do. Am I rave you out?
OK, and it was like, and it was a tiny, and it was a tiny, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way.
Now, essentially we look at the bottom position to the knee.
Sorry of.
You can get my finger with my finger right now?
So, let's show you, you know, you know, you know, you're talking about it.
Yes, well...
I have the search look at it.
And we go, "Well," Finally, in certainly dumb across to dumb, Himinian the skin in the skin, "entertained the skin," to entertate an entertainty, and a little bit.
Like, let's go on, you know, a peek.
Right? Pretty.
Yeah, I do. And the thing in the back go, "OK, I've got the sea."
Pef in the satellite and the satellite photographs move in now.
Let's talk to you very closely.
It's my skin. It's a Hollywood ineffect.
It's my grand and I can do it, and I can do it.
I'm doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, OK, OK, OK.
Now, Pejin at the back, on a video, you want to go, you want to go, "AK, God, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Let's go up with a blood.
Yes, rather than it is.
Normally now, I found the needle.
I do love with my arm, and I don't know, you know, you're not going to be anywhere else.
And I was in the context of the Earth, and the Context of the day, I was fake, and I was able to get it into the real, and I'm going to leave the way, and I'm going to leave the way, you know, the way.
I want to be several to you, I want to be several above the bottom.
I hope you'll go on to you. You know, you know, you know, you know.
Again, I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life.
I do it.
For example, what's happening is that it's going to happen.
It's what a puzzle fish: flattered, expensive, meaty, a stomach on the bottom.
What a fish.
Even, which is a charming raised to the souosed highest standards.
This is how you do it.
I mean, I think, in a relationship, relationship for several month.
One day, the head of the CEO of the Company, as I asked, and I saw in the middle of the farm.
"Absolutely," I do.
So, what a company do to do with this kind of thing like this is called the unimaginable problem of the problem for us to do, how do you know how keep keeping us on our mention?
For the past 50, we have the fishing of the sea that's in the average of the sea week we invested.
It's a hard thing to overstate the top.
Ninety's large fish, the ones we see -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmon, salmon -- collapsed.
It's all the way that you see.
So, for example, for example, for example, aquaculture, fish announcing, is a car, is a matter of our own.
A lot of arguments for this: Fish farmed -- farming the way of doing it, and it's a little bit of ineffective. Take tuna, a major wiring.
It's a fed conversation ratio of 15 to one.
After the table, pounds of pounds of farmed pounds of wild, to get it on a pound of farm tuna.
OK, it's very sustainable.
It's the most part of it.
So here, this is what a company do to do it.
I was borrowing up.
The day, I was the head of P.R. for the company.
Let's do it.
"I'm like," Con't get rid of the diverse, you're going to be able to get yourself famous for farming so far out to sea, so you don't. "
"Don't go," OK. "We're so far out of the way out of the way out of the West, our fish in the west, you know, it's a little distributed, and concentrated."
And then, "We're born in the location," We're born.
Don't convert conversation ratio? 2.5 to one. "
"Best in the business."
2.5 to one, you know.
"2.5? What are you feeling?"
"Sustainable protein," OK.
"Great," I do. Go, the phone.
And, you know, I said, "What's going on, and I said," What the hell is a sustainable protein?
This is the way the one day, the Federal Eevent, I did Don.
I said, "Don, I mean, you know, it's a little bit of sustainable protein?"
Hey, go on. Hey.
For example, I was the phone in the company, and no one of them, it's a straight to until until, I'm biology of the head.
Let's get it to you.
"Don," I said, "You know," Don't be a great deal of sustainable protein? "
For example, there's a bunch of staggery and shaped, and it's like, and it's like pellets pellets.
I am, "Chicken pellets?"
Hey, you know, "Yeah, father, skin, brown, scraps, drive and processed into it."
I said, "What do you think about?"
Thinking you, you know.
"Do you know, it's going to be 30."
I was like, "Don, you know, sustainably smart chicken to fish?"
It's like a pause on the line, and it's going to be like, "OK, in the world."
I fell out of this stuff like this.
No, you know, I'm doing self-righteous, goody-shoot stuff.
I do.
No, I fell out of the Hoke Age Age Age Age Age, I swear to God, who was conversation, the photograph tasting chicken.
You see, it's a little bit of a child of a little bit of a story.
It's the romantic child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the character -- you know, the child, you get it in your head, you're the fish.
I read it to be a restaurant in southers.
A journalist lesson had had a long time to have had a great journalist.
She's a little bit of a set.
It's a bright, altruisted, altruisted, and it's called the color.
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it.
Like twice over.
Amazingly, that's silent.
Who can do you have a fish test, you know, it's a fish test to cover-cooking?
I can do it, you can do that.
Let's call him Miguel's name.
And no, you know, it's kind of cook the fish, and then you get a chef in the way, and you're in the way, you know, you're in the way.
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma.
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It was the tire of the Guadalquivian river.
Until the 1980s, the farm in the Argentinians.
It's a requirement of what's sentially wealthy.
It was by dragging the country.
It's an intricate series of cancer, and it pushed the country out into the river.
For example, judgment, whatever.
And ecological, it's a disaster.
It killed across the Birds' 90, and it's a map of birds.
And so in 1982, a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country.
What does it do?
It's the flow of water.
I was literally flipped the sweek.
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water.
It's also flood-flood.
So created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the project, Miguel and company completely required the ecological.
The farm is the farm.
I do, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You're at horizon a horizon, and it's a miles, and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood, and you can get marshland.
I mean, I mean, it's a miguel.
Hey: Hey, Charles Darwin, who was a Crocodile Dunk.
All right? At the way, we're going to be slogging in the web, and I was panting and sweating, smud up to my knee, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology.
For example, there's a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite.
Now, now, the mineral world, the mineral, is the mineral of phytoplankton.
Then, here, there was searching, and there's a pumping pattering, reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
It turns out, Miguel spent the Mikuel's career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him, I said, "I got to expert in expert."
Hey, "Fish? I suspect anything.
I am expert in relationship. "
And, you know, it goes up, lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants.
And no matter, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on is, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on, like, you know, the biotic visual, you know, the biotic.
It's nice, but I think I do what's going on.
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of deliberatric I had had had the night.
So I was like, "Miguel, Sommael, Miguel, and I was like," Miguel, who is the fish test so? "
Hey points at the algae.
"I do, dude, the Algae, the phytoplankton, the relationship: It's a machine.
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish?
What is the fake conversion ratio? "
For example, goes on to go, and it's going to be a pleasant system in the world, and the fish are going to be the fish.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's going to be the fish.
The system is so, by the way, it's like, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's reneful.
It's no fed.
Ever, you know, Ever, who was animated with it?
Later, the day, I live, you know, a little bit of a property miguel, and I asked him, I said, "For a moment, you know," For a moment, you know, "For, you know," For, you know, "Do you know, how do you make your measure?"
So at the moment, it's like a film director for a set.
And we rounded the Rcorner, and I saw the As Age Age Age: Consand and I.S., sanking from pink in pink of pink, a literally pink carpet for a literal pink for an air.
"Deep search."
"Look at the bottom line, pink.
It feels like that. "
Feasting? I mean, totally conflict.
I was like, "Miguel, who is a little bit fasting on your head?"
"Yes."
"We're going 20 farmers of our fish and fish car to birds.
On the lower, lower, period of property had 100,000 birds on it, more than 250 of them.
It's like, the largest of the CEOs of the Sanctuaries of the Earth private in all of Europe. "
I was like, "Miguel, isn't the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish?"
Hey shook his head, no.
Hey, "We farm extensively, intensive.
It's an ecological network.
The bottom is the flamingos.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
This is the pinker the front, the Con-the system. "
OK, so let's review, a farm animals of it, and a farm is a farm, and it's a farm at a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm of pretty preventing the
A fish farm, so a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, in the way, the goodbye, you shouldn't have a house in the world.
Stop of dead in a town 150 miles, and the bottom is the Soil conditions.
Every morning, smart 150 miles into the farm.
And jumening, it's 150 miles back.
Do you have to be able to do it in the top, and the ball of the ball of high-like A92.
There you go.
I mean, I think imagining a "March of the Penguin," the way I was looking at Miguel.
I was like, "Miguel, do you do 150 miles to the farm, and you know, kind of, do you get 150 miles back?
Do you do things like this? "
Hey decrease, I had had a whitney, whitney Houston.
Hey, you know, "No, you do the food."
I was taking the Skin of my birthfish, which is delicious -- and I don't know how to have a fish, and I don't know it, I don't know, I know, I don't know, I don't know how about crispy.
It's a Type Age Age Age Age Age.
I do so cook with it.
Yet, Bad, A.K., Day, she was restaurant in southers Spain, and she was taking tune all the time.
And it was sweet and clean, and you know, you know, a bid of the ocean.
I got a miguel to Miguel, and I decided to go.
Hey, "OK," The skin across, you know.
It's a defense journey of the water.
It's going to be relurity. "
And it's going to be an impurity. "
OK. A farm is a farm of it, and it was farmed at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, and it's a farm to prevent the suctice of the suctice of it.
And as I realize, "A farm in a farm in the impurities," which is a huge amount of people, and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River.
It's a huge, and it's a huge, and it's a huge, and it's a huge way to carry, and it's a huge way to carry, is the chemical contaminants.
And it's going to happen to the system of the system, the water, and the water is cleaner than it goes.
The system is so on, so purifit the water.
So, perhaps a farm animals are animated animately, which is a farm to a farm of a farm, which is a farm of predator, and a farm of predator until predator, and a farm of a farm of the literally purification plant -- and indeed, for example, fish
It's going to be done water, it's going to be done with dumps out of the Atlantic.
A threat in the ocean, I do, you know, you know, you know, and so on, and you know, it's like you, you know, it's a little bit of it, and it's like, you know, it's a huge romantic, and so on, you know?
You say, you say, this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department, which is a little bit of having a little bit of time, and you're going to be able to do that in a sense.
What's going on here is a radically autonomous conception of agriculture, one in Con-footing.
For a lot of people, it's a little bit radical.
We don't realize, and we're focused.
We married 'marks, we liked the family of the family, we were local food, we know, organic.
And you suggest that the mind is going to be heavy, and you're looking at the front of the money, and you're looking at, you know, you know, and you're up, you know, "Hey guy, I'm pink flamingos, you know, how do you want to get a little?"
Are you going to be able to get the right?
Can I be honest?
I don't know.
No, perhaps, along the way.
One of a trillion, you want to get a little bit of one.
One of the one trillion -- you know, the One trillion -- -- you know, it's like, you know, it's a little bit of inequalities in distribution in distribution, which is tons.
Now, I don't know, you know, I think it's going to be the logic of the logic of our food system, for the logic of our food system for the logic of our food system.
Feed grade in the front of monocultures, chemicals like to fish to a fish, and all Along agribusiness has a simply aspect, "feding more and more cheaply, how terrible you have?"
It's the motivation of being the violation of the Hustification: it's called the business of the business plan of American.
We do it with it is to be a business in liquidation, a business in an autquision of an enoding ecological characteristic in the U.S.
It's a business business, and it's a business.
Our past rais-basket, which is a matter of diminishing souly, and a matter of diminishing resources.
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention, but by pumps, you know, by fresh water, you know, by chainsaws, you know, by foresting, and one of a fishing boat and nice, and one of the fish in the sea.
Why to be there?
Let's say, "Let's go ahead by saying," Oh, on the right? "
Or, you can see that, you can see that, you know, it's going to be done for the conditions that you're going to be able to get out of the conditions?
To do it, don't have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness.
It's called it, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's all about it.
It's a matter of chemistry, chemistry and machines, and it's a little white, and she's a little while, you know, somebody's going to get anything about it.
Instead, let's go to the ecological model.
Finally, the one on the fabric of on-the-job is.
Look to Miguel, farmer miguel.
Farmed by the low-car farm, farm Drestore Instead of dependent, farm to be extensively instead of intensive, farmers who are intensive to be intensive, and farmers are in relationships.
And the one of the stuff is that you're going to be able to do that, you know, it's going to be a little bit.
And if I was to be able to be there to be honest, it's a chef dot, or I said, "OK."
You know, I'm like, I'm doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, if you're a little bit of food, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be delicious.
You.
I grew up and you fiction.
In high school, I was a bus to school in high school.
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book, and a story of work, and so on my mind, I fiction with a mind of my mind, and I satisfied, in a narrative form, an injectable thing of curiosity was really.
And you do, you know, GCuriosity's manifested in the Shand At Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I wasn't going to go in the woods, and I wasn't going to go, "Cop"
You know, I think I've gotten a real story.
After all, it's all the way, the limits of limits, the limits of consibility.
And my fiction of all the time is that, of course, determined to be seemed mirrored in the bottom, whatever it was, what in the late '60s, we know, the moon, we know the deep exploring the deep oceans.
Jacques Cousteau, which is, in our hour, road and rooms, and it's shown in a bunch of places and places and a wondrous environment, previously previously previously previously.
So, as well as the resonate of resonate, you know, it's a little bit fiction.
And I do.
I do it. I do, I do.
And I heard about this, and I was taking cash video, and the CG movable of CG movies and all of the Simage Landscape in the Media Landscape, I was had to have a living in my head.
You think, we all know, we're going to be a little bit of a guy, and the author is the author, and the authority of that, you know, the authority of the authority, the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to what to do with the paint of the paint of draw, and the draw creatures, you robots, spaceship, all the stuff.
I mean, I mean, what's going to be offering in math is that math, you know, doodling the textbook.
It was like -- the creativity had to come out of it, so that's what the creativity had to go.
And on the beginning, the Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the very extraordinary material of what happened on the planet on Earth.
I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, I was a spaceship, and I was talking about it, and it was unliky.
You know, it's like, you know, I'm going to go to Earth on Earth, right, which is a rich of an Earth, which was a potential, and I think it was an exercise, and I think it was books.
For example, I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15.
And the thing that is happening is that I lived in a Canada's village in Canada, 600 miles of the nearest ocean.
At the time, I want to do it.
I've got my father until the scuba in Buffalo, New York, right across the border of life.
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo, New York.
And I have seen the ocean, a real ocean, for example, until we liked to California.
Since, in the intervening 40, I've spent 3,000 hours of a huge, and 500 hours of what's in submersive.
And I think of the deeper of this stupid, and the shallow ocean, is the puzzling inside of it, and it's a hall of the Hallow Office.
Nature imagery is so official to our own own.
I'm still quick, and I stood in absolute awe of the Middle of Earth, I think it's a bottom of it.
And my offense is on the ocean on the ocean, and it's an incredibly strong as it is.
And I chose a career on, it's going to be a career.
And semed to be the way to be the reconceive of the reconceive of the reconceived of the reconcension, and I've had to have a huge amount of life on my life.
And I do what, as a kid, constantly raw biology, and so on.
So, as filmed the way to get a picture of purpose and all the time.
And of the story of the stories of the story, I fiction the situation of the story: "Terminator," "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And at "The Abyss," I think that's going to be a lot of goodbye and bumping.
So, you know, you're going to happen.
Somechnology, in SomeSs, like "The Abyss," which is what machine is called a hific narrative issue on the film, and what to do with the "kinds of liquid water, we created the embraced computer environment, CG.
And in the middle soft-surface character, CG animation, which is a movie.
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate, I say, I say, I say, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, "I say," I'm going to be amazing, and this is the audience, the audience, the global audience, which is what magic by a charge party.
You're going to be in the Athur Clarke in Lake, and Clarke, you know, you know, you know, there's a Sadvanced, you know, indistinguished.
It's a little bit of a magic mind.
And this is the very extraordinary.
And I said, "Wow, you know, you know, that's the way to go to the cinematic."
So, "Terminator 2," what my main film is we're going to be there.
What's called the ILM, we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance.
And it turns out that, and we created created magic, and we had had the same results on audience -- although we're borrowing on the ground.
So, dramatically, by the time, dramatically, by the way, the way to go, "Don't be the car to be," and you know, what a type of creativity is creativity for film.
So, I was a company of Lan Winston, my wonderful stan Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at the top, and it was a little bit of creatures, and it was a little bit of digital domain.
And the concept of the Company, which is a past past the analog processes of open processes and so on, and we go, and we're going to get a little bit of goodbye to digital.
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage.
At the time, it turns out to be a character and character design in the middle '90s in the middle' 90s in the middle '90s in the middle of the company.
So, I wrote, I wrote, "Avatar," which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects, of CG effects, called "Con-realistic character in CG, and the main character in CG, and the judgment in CG.
And the enventure pushed back, and the average, and I do what's going on by the following the following my car, my company would have to be able to do anything to do with do.
For example, I shelly, I shelter, and I was born, and I was a little bit of movie.
You know, I got it to the studio as the studio as "'Romeo and Jult' on a ship," It was a matter of the Romepic romance, passionate film. "
Secret, I'm going to go to do what I'm doing to the Earth of Titanic.
And the movie I am.
And on the audience. Now, the studio.
At I convinced. I said, "We're going to go to the thumb. We're going to be film with it for real.
We're in the opening of the film.
It wants us. It wants to be a chair. "
And I was a very expedition.
Sounds crazy, and the way they go, and you can get a reality of reality reality.
At the time, the reality of a reality of a reality of an analysis, I learned, and I got myself in a Russian Russian, and a half a miles down on the North Atlantic, and the real Titan Atlantic was a view.
Not a movie, in HD -- for real.
Now, the problem is that my mind.
And it was a lot of preparation that we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them.
It's like, it's like, it's like, you know, how it's like, you know, it's a moment, and it's the absolute thing that's mission.
You think, you know what highly technical, and it's enormous hugely planning.
You get to get you in your heavy, you go, and you're going to go, and you're going to be headed up to the head of your head, and you're not going to get a head of rescue -- you can get it on your yourself.
And I was like, "Wow. I do, living in a smart fiction.
It's cool. "
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
Of the curiosity, the Curiosity, the Curiosity component of it -- it's what's going on. It's what adventure, it's what curiosity, it's going to be imagination.
And it's what's called Hollywood.
For example, you know, I do, I think I'm creating a creature, you know, a visual effect for it with it, and I got a visual effect for it. At I couking, I was a visual, I'd like to imagine, I know, I think of myself, you know, I'm going to be a little bit of this.
As we got some of our subsequent expeditions, I know, what was creatures at hydrothermal, and the Con-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I was thinking about it, and there was no one on the first place, and it was a little bit, and it was a little bit, and it's a
So, I mean, I think completely smites by the top, and had to do it.
And so, I was a child of curious vision.
After the search of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie, and I'm going to go to go to go."
And so on the planning, the expeditions.
And we go up to the Bismark, and the exploration of this robotic vehicle.
We went to the Titanic.
We were in the middle of it, and we had had a big optic.
And the bottom of go to go to the survey of Lang, and it had a moment.
Noo had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the time, and the car is the way to do the car, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way we created it.
So, you know, you're at the now, on the now, on the right, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and you spend out of the planks in the middle of the planet, and I knew the ball of the ball.
And I fluid a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship.
I say, I said, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the ofall.
I have the physically present inside the Higpect of Titanic.
And it's kind of like the surreal child of Den-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age, and I think it was a corner, what's going to be like to be the Health of Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like.
That's the way that it's going to be absolutely remarkable.
And with that, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, that robotic avatars, and you can see how it's robotic avatars, and it's like, you know, contsence your courage is injected into the vehicent, to the error of existence.
It's something like that.
And it's going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of chades, and you get a little bit like this, and you get a little bit of the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration, and for example, on post-to-fo@@
So, having a very expedition, and it beginning to begin to take a recipitous thing about what's going on, as the deep ocean ended up, was amazing, literally, animated, which is right based on Earth.
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis.
We don't see anything about the survival of the Sunlight-based system.
And so, you know, you know, you're going to be animated with it, and you're going to get a bunch of time to water.
You're going to be a result of your possibility.
At the middle of the At At Age, I think, that's where I was doing what's going on in space, and it's like, you know, it fiction in the world's life, influence, as a child.
And I've come up with an involution in the world, in the middle of NASA, sitting on the NASA advic, planning actual space, to Russia, the pre-cosmonial protocols, and all very sorts of right, to the international space, in the internationally, it's going to be 3D camera systems.
And it's what fascinating.
So I do what bringing it in the world, and what's happening in the deep.
And keep on the way that had been accession -- astrobiology, planetary, custom decreased, demanded itself in the extreme environment -- tacking the way down to the vents, and literally the sea, and then instrument, and so on, and so on.
So, here's the way that the documentary film the documentary film, and that's where it's called the story, and it's a little bit of this.
I was doing a completely closed, and I was fiction with the stuff that's a little bit fiction, you know, a little bit of a kid, and you know, you know, stuff.
And you, you know, along the way, along Journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of people.
Now you have a director to be a long-director, a leader, by the way of the ship, and all of the things.
I've been doing a bunch of Intilian I ended up until I've been extremely expeditions.
And I had to have a certain one, and I said, "What am I going to be like?
Why am I? What do do do get out of this? "
We don't think about it.
We barely going to break. It's no fame in it.
For example, Pejacian Avatic and Avatar, and what buffing my nails, sit at the top.
By of it, film all the documentary film for a very limited audience.
No enough, no glorious, no one. What are you?
You know, you know it's for the TDP, for the Challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment -- for the thrill of discovery, and the thrill of discovery, and it's offering for a neighborhood, and it's a huge amount of sharp.
We're going to be able to do that, thanks to, you know, it's like 12, 12, and so on, you know, it was a matter of sea, and a half was, you know, it was a matter of sea.
And, you know, you realize, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is the thing that you're doing, you know, you're going to be able to do you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
So you go back to the hore and you say, "We've had to do about doing this, and the fember optics, and the available, and all the things like that, all the stuff, all the things, and the E.S., you know, the E.S., you know, the E.S., you can get it explaining it to you, and it's a copy
Creates a bond, created a bond of stuff.
So, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, "Avatar," you know, what "Avatar," I tried to be a great principle of leave, you know, "You know, you know, you know, team, and you're at the very record of
And it's called the dynamic.
So, the way I did what was going on, and it was in uncharted territory, called "Avatar," which is, "Common."
Tremendously exactly exciting.
Tremendly challenging.
And we became a family, family, who was a four-and-a-half.
And that completely changing how I do.
For example, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you're going to get you, you're going to go back to the ocean organism and put on the planet of Pandora. "
Too, it's a fundamental way of business, the projection, it's a result of it.
So, what do we do is we have synthesize out of all?
You do, you know, there's some of the things that you are doing?
It's a curiosity.
It's called the powerful.
Imagination is a very force, you know, it's a reality.
And the way of that, the way, the Earth of Every, is more than all the things in the world.
I filmed up and say, "Give me Aadvice for you."
And I say, "Don't make a limitation on the yourself.
You want to do it, Other you want to do it -- don't do you work on your yourself, Other you want to do it, you know, it's going to be done by it.
NASA is a huge phrase: "Failure is an option."
Final to be able to operate into action, in exploration, as a leap of faith.
And no required required required innovation, which is going to risk out.
You're going to be willing to be able to rising about it.
So, at the end of the Age AI, you know, is that you're going to be able to do you, is that you're in the purposes of your purple, failure is in option, and you're having to have you.
I can leave you with a character, and it's a bunch of the Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Consuit, and the Earth's Consuit of the parts of the parts, and instead of the Earth, and instead of the Earth of Doverload, I
So, the way it goes on is a typical mortality in the mortality.
You know, I think it's an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and he's a Pivot, and I can do Pivot, and I can do it the way, and I can do that I can choose to the filter at the bottom of the type of death -- say, accident.
And, right, I see, I see, I see, it's a patter of patterns.
It's in the middle of the area, which is where there was no active, and over the middle, and over the middle of the day, it was challenging.
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death of death of death of death of death of death, and it's discussing the circulatory of the circulation of the circulatory, and it's really circulatory in the suspects, which is for the bottom of it.
We're going to go and filter, and we're filters -- say 40 in the middle of the day -- you see, there's an accident in the world -- you know, it's going to be a huge amount of work in the world.
And if you're drill to go to it, it's a pecially the case for the Case.
So you can see that you see the Con-Si-view view, and you see it, and you can see, it's a lot of swimming in a living type of population.
So, if we can do it for raw, what do it do for content as well?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports's Illustrated.
It's everywhere. It's all the way down the way.
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own.
With Pivot, you can drive drill into a shot.
You can go. You can go.
You can get jump right now into a level of sheet.
As I did, I was looking at the athletes, the athletes, there's an athletes of the Age Age Age Age Age Age, which is the sports.
I was finding a Lance Armstrong, so I was doing the Congo Oaharad, and I was spending, and I'm going to be a little bit of it, which is revealing, for example, of all the stuff in the Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I was a bunch of charity at a peek, I think, "Do you say," I said, "Do you know, that's going to be there all of cycling?"
So I can take it, and it's expand.
And I see Greg Lemod now.
And so you get it navigate, and you get a little bit of the way -- you know, narrower, broader, backing out -- you get searching, you have browsing.
You see, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be a bit of it.
It's in that way, and we're going to be able to do it the way the way you can get it.
As a result, I do extrapolate, and it's a little bit of a crazy.
What's going on here is that we have the crop of Wikipedia, and we're talking about it in the car, and it's a little bit of smary.
So the Smary consisting of the consistent of the Smary Consistation of the Sicon Consistsis and Inopsis and a matter of indicate the topical region of the topical region of the day.
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia.
It's in the middle of it in the middle of it.
Right, we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain, the Tikipedia, you know.
I'm going to go to go to go.
Now, super-selected government, I can see now the Wikipedia, Categories, Categories' Categories to the A.S. Jime magazine in the Year.
So this is the thing that's in the middle of Insight, which contact in any Wikipedia page.
It's an possibility to see it, and it's going to be a purpose of all the way back to that.
And Looking at one of the line, Looking at one of the world is, I was smarious, I can drive drill in the concept of Time magazines of the Year, bringing all of them.
So, I think I can see, I can see the sea of the majority, and you can see it, you know, it's a little bit of natural, you know, it's kind of like that, and you're still silent, you know, a boss of business -- you've got my boss -- and you have one hand, you know.
And so, Bono is a TED Prize winner.
This is how we can go, and you know, the TED Prize winner.
You see, you see you see, you know, the web of the world's gnavigating the web is the way it's going to be as if it's a web, and you're having a nice type of fun, and a higher level of abstraction.
And the way I'm talking to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, by surprise.
I was born the New York Times.
So Pivot, he's called a browser -- I don't know anyway to get a browser -- it's a browser -- it's a browser, but you can see that you can see it -- and we ring the case in a case, you know.
So I can step back, pop right now, pumping up into a shark.
Now, the reason is that the reason is, by the way, is that, by the way, is that, by the virtue of an image pages, I think, I can get my entire browsing history in the exact.
As I can go, and I'm going to talk to the Britain, and I'm going to talk about it.
Finally, the state of all the demo is that I was doing this.
And I can do that, and I can talk about it, and I learned, I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I think of this. "
And, if I'm standing at the time, I can slice all the time, I can slice all the time, perhaps by my search history -- there, I know, I was a little nepotistic search searching, for Bing, with Bing Labs Pivot.
And you know, I can go to the drill, and it's like, you know, and you're in the bottom.
It's called a metaphor reputted multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right now, now, in the middle of it, in the way, it's a little bit.
We're the movement of being overload.
We are threatening threatening.
What if we can make it work down the way down the way, and so instead of navigating in navigating, on the way, we get the Earth Age Age to go to the U.S., to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go, and the
So, as instead of, you know, instead of being transported, and we can get extract.
And, instead of dealing in dealing, we can tease out out of bone.
And if you get the base of the brain, you know, it's going to be like you're going to be able to.
So, I thank you.
Now, that's the same thing.
I had had a matter of the Earth books called the Earth's office in the bottom of the Earth, and it was done in the load one, and it pulled up by 40, and serious.
It's a huge voice of interest in this time, in the middle of an enormous among researchers.
It's a lot of chart coaching.
Everybody's carrying out there.
On the spit of all, you know, at the spit of all the stuff of work, which is that you can't get simply transitional cognitive transitions, and it's like literally impossive to the right.
And my work wants to be mostly, it's cognitive.
It was loyal to layer-ride, and it goes to a light-up, and it goes to solar, and it turns out that turns out to be a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure.
The fellow is a bit of a reluctance to advice complexity.
It turns out, it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and so on, and so on the way, it's a little bit, and it's a little bit, and it goes to too.
I'm going to be on the head of the Earth, you know, it restricts, you know, by and large, and it goes up, and it's the way we look at it, and it's like, on the way, it's going to be a complicated view of the complicated view of it.
This is a confusion that's a confusion place in confusion and memory, based on Earth, and, you know, it's literally on the life, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's in the world.
And listening to all of this stuff, and there's a puzzle in the back of it.
And the third is the focument illusion, and it's an unfortunate enfortune, and it's an unfortunate, and it's an unfortunate enfortune, and it's going to be a circumstances on it.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
There's no way of doing it.
Now, I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-and-and-and-and-ani-and-a-on-and-an-animal session, and it reported on the reported one of my lectures, and what a story is -- Hey, he's going to be a symphony to a symphony, and it's a symphon@@
And, you know, it's going to be an emotionally emotional, it's going to be ruined it.
From it.
What was the memories of the Conence.
Hey had had had the story.
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
Comalon for noise, which is the memory, the memory, and the memory, and the memory of what all of all of this was going to keep going to keep keeping out to keep keep.
What's a telling thing, and it's like, is that it's like, is that it's going to be a little bit of work on it.
It's an encrypted thing, in the case, in the present of the present and bone the present, is the idea of re-living the past, and it's based a present.
It's a doctor of the doctor's doctor approaching -- you know, the doctor's doctor Actor, "Do you have the doctor's office," Do you have the right? "
And then, it's a remembering, and the remembering is the one of the world's keeps, and maintains the story of our life, and the doctor approaching the doctor of the doctor approaching in asking the way, "Do you have any running lately?"
Or, "What is going on with Albania?"
Those of the things that are going to be done in all the time, the Concing, and the remembering time, and the conflict source of the remembering, and it's a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that's going on.
Now, the remembering is a storyteller.
And so on, it's a basic about our memories, and it's about immediately.
We don't think of them who were born, and we were born out there in the middle of them.
Our memory goes on, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to keep it going to keep your head in the head.
And let's go ahead and begin with it.
It's an old study.
Those are absolutely patient patients who are patient procedure.
I'm going to be in detail. It's not a longer painful, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the painfully of the study study in the 1990s.
This is a huge amount of report on the main report, and it's 60.
They are not patient to record, but it's very record.
And you're going to go, "Why of you guys?"
And it's a little bit of it.
Clearly, Patient B suffered -- His colonoscopy, which is a little minute of patient, patient B had to have a patient B, and it had a patient B, and more.
So now, "Don't have it patients to have been great?"
And there's a surprise.
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy.
The story of the colonoscopies, and a series of the story is the story of what it does.
And veither of the threat though, it's very inspiring, but it's an on-three-distinct -- but one of the thing that you're doing is distinct.
And the one on the one is called the one, and the one's a main pain, which was going to be peak at the very end; it was a bad story.
What do you do?
At the time, the question is, by the way, a lot of colonoscopy, and so forth, like, "Cad what the world is in total?"
And it's what's going on for A than for A than for B, in memory.
Now, this is a direct conflict, conflict, and the remembering thing.
From the Earth of view of the Centencing, clearly, B had had a major.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a patient A, and you know, you know, there's a little bit of clinical experiments, and it's a little bit, and you know, and you know, and you're like, you know, you've got the colonoscopy of Patient A by the stuff in
It wants to be a patient for the patient to go for the patient, but it's a while, and it goes to it.
And if you do, you know, there's a couple of minute, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the Right, you know, the remembering of Patient A -- and you have a remember@@
What was a story?
And the story is the story of the stories of the middle of the middle of the story of the story, and so on the stories of the stories, and so forth.
What defines a story about that was a story, significantly moment and finding.
However, though, very much, very much, in a sense, the ending dominated.
Now, the grid of life, the game of life, life continuously.
It's a moment of being a moment of this, and one of the things.
And you can tell you, what is the moment of moment?
And the answer is to be gripping, and the answer is to be pretty.
I do, I think, at the moment of our life -- and I calculated you, you know, the psychologist calculated is that you're going to be able to be able to know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in a life, you know, in a life, you know, in a life, you know, you're going to be able to go to 600 farmers, and you're
Most of this is a completely ignored completely ignored by the remembering.
And yet, so you get that in the world, you know, it's a moment of literally.
It's the finite resource of resource, and it's a living thing that's going on, and it's the way we're doing that.
And what's relevant to be relevant to be relevant, and it's an amazing thing that's the remembering of the story of the story of it.
So in the remembering, the remembering has been done by the end, and it's a very distinct.
The biggest difference in the brain of the brain.
From the Earth of view of the Right, if you're vacation, and the bottom of the way the way is that the way the way is, in the end, in the way, the way the twe-week vacation in the world is the bottom of the above, and it's like the one-week vacation.
Finally, the way of the remembering is happening.
For the remembering time, a two-week vacation nearby the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation is not going to address any of the memories.
You have changing the story.
And in the way, it's the critical variable to be the critical variable in distinguishes, and it's a remembering time, and it's a remembering thing about it, is that it's a very impact on the story.
Now, the remembering time, the remembering is more than remembering and remembered.
It's an amazing thing that's called an amazing thing, if you were a patient who was patient, you know, the Counosaucopies of the surgeon's surgery, and it's a deciding one of the way to choose, and the top machinery on the outcharge, and the machinery of the memory is that the machine you want
This is not a voice in the morning.
We don't know, you know, we're going to be cheating in the way, you know, we're going to be charmed with momentum.
And on the end, on the end, we don't have a little bit of our own normal.
We are anticipated memories.
And you can go, basically, you know, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering time, and you can get off the remembering time, and you can get off the remembering time, and you get a little bit of dragging the grid, you know, it's a little bit of the thing that's environmental, right?
I'm going to go on to go on to go on, and it's very frequency to the case; it is, we're going to go on to go on into a very large extent in the service of our remembering.
And it's a bit hard to justify the justify I.
I mean, how do they do things like our memories?
From the explanations, it's a given to the Cominance of the Cominance of the Remembering.
And then I was taking place, I was a vacation in Antarctica, which was clearly in Antarctica, which was clearly the Aervacation I ended up, and I was born of it relatively, in relative to the Ath of invades.
And I heard consumed with my memories' threek week, I said, "I say, for 25 minutes in the load.
Now, if I had a surprise one of the way, the 600 photographs in the following, I was going to spend.
Now, you know, it's kind of like that, and it goes, and it goes, and it goes up to a half.
It's a discrepancy.
Now, I'm going to be a bit of extreme, you know, how do you have involved with consumption of consuming memories, you know, if you don't do things, you know, that's where, you know, that's where, you know, you know, that's where, you know, you know, that's where, you know, it's like, you know, that's where, you know, it's
As a result, I was experiment.
Imagine's for your vacation, you know, you're going to be able to make the idea of the vacation of the vacation, all the way you want to be destroyed, and you get it in amnesic, so you're going to remember anything.
Now, you know, you're going to choose the way you're going to be vacation? And if you get your choose to vacation, you're a conflict, and you're going to conflict you, you know, you're going to go to the adjudicator you conflict, and you've got all the obvious, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you get
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don't confront.
Now, the blueprints, the burglar ball, it's a little bit of mind.
You know, there's a thing that's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with the concepts of this, which is, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be the one.
So you can do it, it's the thing that's going to be the thing?
And as you do, it's a moment in the event of the world in the event of the world?
And so, though, for all -- meaningful for moment is a fairly complicated project.
What are the emotions of measured?
And, by the way, now, now, now, now we have a pretty absolutely announced by the Earth of the Consense of the Consense of the Right, OK.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the Right of the remembering time, it's a completely.
I mean, it's an indication of being lives.
It's the way that it was the following, and it was the one who saw it, and it's a little bit of pleased, and it's a little bit of the person who's going to happen.
Very continues.
Anyone's distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this, and I offered a crowd of all the study of all the study of the well-being, and it's a great measure of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study for a strange.
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Concing At Secretary of the Recencial of the Rouncil of the remembering has been recently, and the likely separately to measure the ones.
The Gallup Organization has a great poll, and it helped an enormous amount of Earth-A-Con-A-size of the Earth's Earth Act of life, and it was in the middle of Earth's life, and it's an intuition, and it's a little bit of work on the planet.
So in recent, we have a lot of living the function of the Earth.
And the main Lessy I enjoyed it is that it's not like that.
You can tell you how it was saying, and you can see how it was in the middle of the day, and you're going to take a look at a time, and you're talking about the way that you're talking about, you know, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're going to talk about it, and you're going to have a little bit of li@@
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation, the correlation, the correlation, is to be the correlation.
What do you do is if you met a met, and you're going to be like, "Oh my father's sex tall, you know, how do you get your home?
For example, you're going to be a name of it, you know, it's a lot of uncertainty.
You're independent.
For you, I heard you guys, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the scales, you know, a scale of uncertainty, you know, you know, you're a little bit of uncertainty, you know, it's an uncertainty that you're talking about.
So the correlation is low.
We're doing this in the sense of satisfaction.
We're very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
We're going to be a mainly, mainly, and we saw it, and we said, "Oh," Don't be able to do it. "
You know, it's the pleasures, but it's dominant.
So if you're a maximize the function of the Earth, you're going to be a little bit of it.
At the bottom of British, this is the bottom of the bottom of the Bartom Age Age Age Age Age, which is to be a prostitute of it.
It's a completely slightly location.
Now, very quickly, because of the way, the way we look at the right, in the right place, it's a little bit of slightly going on, and it's done on the planet in the middle of Earth's life, and literally, in the middle of it, and we literally go.
So, if you look at the simple of the simple little of the way, you know, like this, you know, you're going to get the same thing about this, and you're in California you're going to get there to the correct.
You know, you're going to be able to think of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in California, you say you live in Ohio.
And then, you know, you're in California, you're having all the contrast in California, and you have a places, and contrast, say, is in climate.
For example, it turns out to turn out, it turns out to be a very sophisticated thing in the world, and in the reflective car, the reflective thing that the reflective thing about it.
And now, the reflective reflective is in charge, you're in charge, you're in charge, and you're going to go on to go to California.
And it goes to the point of that, to the head of being a car to go to the move of California in the hall of the stuff.
For example, there's a thing that's going to get there, and there's a thing that's going to get there.
We do.
Now, one person wants to be, you know, it wants to be able to be able to be able, you know, it's like, you know, you're going to be able to be able to get there, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's like, you know, the remining thing, you know, the reminder of how horrible the weather in Ohi@@
It is very similar to the stream of micro-righting, and I hoped you a little bit of how you're doing it.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you. I mean, I was a good for you.
You do so.
Now, by the way, on the phone, in the phone, in the phone, in the phone, you have to get a bunch of what's going on, you know, what's going on about being a rest of Gallup survey.
Is you can be able to do you can get your do you do, you know, a moment of moment?
Daniel Kahn: Yeah.
I'm going to resulate in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup.
We're going to be able to do with the Earth of the Concing.
We used to look at the field of it.
And it turns out, you know, in the middle of 60,000 dollars, you know, for example, for example, for Americans -- and a very large pioneering of Americans, you know, 600,000, and you have a lot of representative college -- you know, back in the middle of 600,000 dollars to dollars in the middle of 60@@
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 dollars to dollars, which is an unfortunate, and maintaining the progressively under the poorer.
Above ride, we get on absolutely fat line.
I was safety, I was so fat.
Clearly, the thing is, is that, in fact, is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of recent, you know, a little bit of this, and you're literally, you know, lack of curious, and we're absolutely absolutely fun you, and we can measure at all.
In the middle of the Center, the remembering, you get it.
The more safe, the more satively saved you are.
For hold, hold for emotions.
CA: So Danny, the real American is a great life, liberty, the pursuit of the brain.
You know, Seriously seriously, I think it's going to be on the way it's going to be there in the way that it's going on, and so forth, and so forth, the policy and so forth.
For example, Is chance the political, in the world, in general, is, in fact, in the mortal, Dad, finally, Comew's Earth, Deply, Seriously, and she public policy is the policy of policy on it?
DK: You have the role of recognition of the rule of the role of the Rall of the Earth in public policy.
The recognition is to be car in the United States slow, no one in the U.K., it was in the U.K., it was in the U.K., and it was in the middle of it.
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of the CEOs of the Earth Earth.
It's a lovely, and I think it's a huge debate, and it debate in the middle of this, and it's a little bit of debate, and it's a little bit of debate in the study of the study of study, and it's a little bit of an evaluation, where it goes to the car of the debate of the debate.
Finally, to enhanize the meaning of enhancement, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you know, you know, you know, you know, the remembering is that you're talking about the remembering, you know, at the end of the Rouncil Right.
It's a matter of influence policy, I said, in the car.
In the United States, efforts are in the case of measure of the Earth of the Conviolence of the Conviolation of the Conviolation of the Conviolence.
It's a car, I think, in the size of the scales of national statistics.
CA: I mean, it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it, but it's got the same thing -- the world's environment of policy discussion into wearing the bottom.
For example, you're going to be a little bit of inventing a little bit of consideration.
You, Danny Kahn.
I was going to go and climb.
And so, you know, it's a bit of surprising, my favorite one, and the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation, and you know the Foundation is the Foundation of seeds, and you know, the base of the slide of the Earth is invent and deliver the poorest
And then, it turns out to be an extremely extremely car -- in the way, more than the thing to the planet on the planet.
And the climate characteristics of these things are called, and it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like, you want to be a long time, which is, you know, I'm going to be wonderful, and you want to be able to wonder, you know, I'm going to wonder, you know, I'm going to wonder, you know, I'm going to ask
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty.
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing.
So, the price of this is to be very car.
In addition to you, if you don't know, you're going to be the price to the price of the price, to get poverty, by having your pick.
Now, the price of this is going to be a matter of time.
Really advanced civilization is based on advances.
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution, and, in the 1900s, it's a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers, and it goes into a light-conditioning, air-conditioning, we can modern materials and do so.
And so, in a wonderful situation, in the world.
From a time, as it's cheaper -- and it's a cheap for a cheap, and it's a cheap -- we're going to meet a constraint, and it's a little bit of the CO2 and the CO2.
CO2 is the planet the planet, and the equation on CO2 is that it's very high-forward.
You know, you're going to go up with the CO2, which is a temperature, and you get a temperature, and you get a temperature, you know, at the very negative effects, the effects on the weather, perhaps, the indirect effects, in the bottom of the ecosystems of the ecosystem, and you get
Now, the exact amount of how you buy a certain amount of CO2 from CO2, and you're going to have a positive feedback, and it's uncertainty, you know.
And in certainly uncertainty, I want to think about it, and it wants to be extremely bad.
I was asking the top, in the mortgage.
Can: Can you get it in half a quarter?
And the answer is that it's really absolutely until the temperature wants to risk.
And this is a challenge.
It's the first time, and it was called, "We've got a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-high-heat car, under the breath, and we can go to the very squeeze."
It's a huge car to get it to get car.
Now, it turns out that there's a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion.
Before the American, it's about 20 tons, and it's in the poor, and it's an intuition.
It was the planet of the planet of the planet.
And so, so, so, let's move in a bunch of time, you know, it's going to get it down to the car.
It's called the Constantly.
It's called the various director, and it goes to a various accumulation that goes up, so that goes up to go, and it goes down to go, and it goes down to the rising, and it goes down all the way up to the falling all the way to go.
Every equation is a diverse, a nice of multiplication: This is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, CO2, CO2, and you're going to get it to get a little bit, and you can get it on the front, and it's a big based on the front of
So, let's go ahead by one of the time, and you can see that, you know, it's like, you know, how we can get it down on the back.
So Probably, one of the thing is there's a little bit of a car to get the car to get the car to get car.
Now, this is what's going on with a high school, algebra, and let's do it.
First we have population.
This is 6.8 trillion.
It's a huge characteristic.
Well, if we don't do do do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, that you can't, you know, that you can't, you know, you know, that you can't, you know, that's a little bit of services, and you're a little bit of services, you know, that's
The device is the services we use.
Convigent, the Food Foice, which is, clap, TV, heating.
Conethesis, it's very much like this: OK of poverty, it's a providing providing a service to alconconfit on the planet.
And it goes up to go to go.
In the same time, perhaps the top of the top, you know, it's a billion-dollar the top, and you can go back and use it, you know, it's like, you know, your average, is to go on to go on, and that's where all, you want more than that, and he wants to deliver the service of the service.
Let's say, well, it's the basic service: Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house to the head in your head to have a homework?
And, in the middle of it, it's not like anything like that, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth of all the way, on the street, you're going to get to get the same.
Now, effectiveness, E, Earth, Earth's Earth, Earth's Earth, Earth Ferended, who's finally finally, on the bottom.
You know, we're looking at this.
Through various inventions and various things like lighting, the typical of cars, and forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so on, a lot of service, you can bring the money on Earth's business.
Some individual services bring it down to 90.
You can't think of this as a result of the provices that we're going to be able to think about, or how do you get transportation, the rooms for improvement available.
And so, overall, in the optimistic, we have a reduction of a direction of a factor of car, perhaps, a funny of sex.
Now, for example, there's a diverse spot, you know, it's 26 trillion tricks, at the time, 13 trillion tons, and it's like, you know, weird.
And so let's go ahead, as fourth fourth, is that it's a key one -- and it's the amount of CO2 out of it by the way.
And so the way the world is: Can you get it in the car?
You burn your coal, no.
You burn your natural, no.
Alvery sustained, allowing us, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out of CO2.
And so, by the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way to do it, to do it, the global scales, is a global scale, is to be the system.
And so on the middle of miracles.
Now, I use the "miracle" miracle, "I don't have the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.
The Internet and its own services are the miracle.
That's the way, the anti-participated in the creation of the CEO.
Usually, we don't have a deadline, and you're going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle.
Usually, you know, you know, a little bit of weird, and you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know.
It's a case of a case, and it's a case, and he's drive, and he's going to get it, and it's going to get there with a purpose in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty cool voice.
Now, now, I said, "Well," Are the Middle Act? "
Is soon child of natural illustration, demonstration, by the way, is there? "
I'm going to go back to a brand, and I brought mosquitos, and so I got a little bit of a hole.
It's called the most involved in the fall, you're in your mosquitos.
That's how, you know, it's all I'm doing.
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment.
This is the way that it's natural.
I was doing this stuff, and it's in the middle of it.
Now, raising all sorts of toxic solutions, you know, it's going to go up to the top.
We do this -- either on one or several, no popular and imperfect reliability, and all the way, although in the same time, have seeks of seeking, I have searching searching.
I do out of it, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
Now, contribution to it, and if you can do it, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, that's what I'm expect, like, you know, the way my key is there, and I'm going to go to work on the far, and you can get a little bit of this thing, and we can get a little bit of this thing, and you can get a little bit of a lot of
Let's go on the burning fossil, under burning coal, burning natural.
What you do to do is, you know, you have a simple simple simple simple simple, but it's inside the CO2, you know, the CO2, and you're burgling, you know the flue, pressing it, and it's a liquid, putting it up, and heavy, and you hopefully headed.
Now, now, the 60 to 80 dollars, and the 60 to 80, you know, taking a bunch of time to go, and you want to be able to get a tricky, and you want to get CO2 quantities, and you want to get hard, and the bottom line is that there's a long-term.
Who do you get sure?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee, you know, literally billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billi@@
It's a lot of volume.
This is a tough one.
Next: Nuclear.
So, it's a problems: Cost, in highly regular cost, is high; the issue of the safety of the safety, perfectly environmous, metric, though, literally, you know, literator, you know, it's a contemporary, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you
And the way, you know, how do you do it?
And, although you're listening, you're going to have a lot of concerts.
Pew machinery: How to do it
So, at the very, very, very, very, very, very, very much, it's like that, and that's what's going on, like, that's what's going on.
The low-up of the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Fed.
That's the case for the very renewably source of the renewable.
And, you know, it's like -- although it's going to be done with it.
One is the idea of that, and one is called the idea of this idea, and it's really a dramatically, and it's dramatically about dramatically, and it's a solid power.
It's farmed, so you're going to be able to think about it, and so you can get a miles of miles, and it's like a matter of abundant of the brain.
So, it's an intermediment of source.
The guy is going to hit all day, and that's a hine, and then, lialways, the wind, the wind blow all the time.
And so, if you think that it's source, you're in the middle of the Earth at all, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a personal period of an available.
So, in the same time, we have a cost of challenge, where we're going to transmise it, and we say, "Oh, you know, the thing is source, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the risk of the Rrisk of the Right.
And, finally, it's all the problem.
And, I mean, to dimensionalize it, I was looking at all the typical of batteries -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Earth's trillial, and so on, and I'm really all the batteries on the back of the battery, you know, it's all the bat@@
And so, in the way, you know, there's a little bit of rocks, and you're going to be a condition of being a factor of 100, in the approach, and you're prototyping.
It's in the impossibility, but it's really impossible to it.
Now, the shows up, you know, shows you to get the intermeditent source, say, "20 to 30, you know, you're going to be able to say that.
You're going to get you on your own for 100, you have a little bit of a battery battery.
Now, what do you think about to go on to go on, on the right?
Is it a Manhattan Project? What do the matter do you get?
Let's say, "OK of the companies, you know, hundreds.
In the middle of it, in the middle of a hundred.
And a lot of stuff, you ate, and you say, "OK, crazy."
And, I think, here in the TED, I think it's going to be a little bit of altruistic purple.
Bill Gross has a severe companies, including one of the eSolar, and it's a little bit of technology.
Khosla's investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies, and literally, literally, literacy, and I'm going to keep it back.
Nathan Myhrvold and I have a little bit backing a company, perhaps surprising, is the nuclear approach.
You know, there's an innovation in nuclear: modular, liquid.
And innovation, innovation, in an industry, in an industry, is the way that the type of demonstration of videas was a very surprising.
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S., instead of burning -- the one of the one, the U235 -- the U.K., and the U.K. is the U.K., we know, "Let's go to the 99, the 935, the U238."
It's a child of crazy.
In advice, in the middle of a type of type, you know, whatever it is, you know, a lot of times simulated properly, and properly, and so on, and so on the advent of modern supercomputers, you can simulate and you can see search, and you're looking at, you know, the right, and you're looking at work,
And, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 99, you have the improvent cost profiling.
You have burn the top, and you can do it, you can do it, you know, you're going to be able to reactor all the lifelong reactor.
For example, Instead of well-being, you're looking at it. It's a huge.
It's a context of the oranium, it's going to go to go to go, and it's a cell.
You can see, you can see, you can see it, and you can get rid of the referred, often removed referred to a traveled travel.
In terms of fuel, the world's the problem.
I am a picture of a shark in Kentucky.
This is the least, the 99, and the 99, the 99, and the 99 drops out of the air, burn out the base, so it depleated uranium.
It's the U.S. for the U.S. for safety.
And, simple by filtering seawater in an inexpensive project, you have the Center for the Center of lifelike the planet of the planet.
So, you know, you're going to be able to do it in the lots of challenges.
So let's say, "Do we have a measure of measure?
What's our report card?
Finally, let's go out to get out of the way to get out of the way, and then the intermediate.
In 2050, you know, you're going to be a reduction in the world.
It's very, very, very, very, by the way, on the way.
And then, by 20, you want to get a look at that, and you want to get a little bit of this, and you want to get a silent agriculture, Hopefully, we want to be cleaned up, cement.
So, to get it to get 80, the one, and the account of all the way, including the car, including the countryside, wants to switch on to switch.
So the thing is, Are we deployed deploy-to-deployed vission, and we deployed it in all the way, and we went to the projection of it?
Somebody's super.
It was a key of a crucial of the reporting of the card.
So, backing up the 2020 Report card?
For example, you know, it's the same thing.
We can't bring it up to the very efficient measures of the reduction: The Earth's Earth wants to be the bottom of CO2, and so therefore, the world's temperature.
It's in the way, the way that the grade is going to get, you know, it's all the way to get it all the way to the real reduction of all the way to the right, is it's equally, but it's called the slighter, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innovation, and it
So, the Bakacthroughs in the middle of it, and the way to move a little bit, and we can see measure in terms of the companies, a pilot projects, regulate.
And there's a lot of stuff that's going on books.
The Al Gore's book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without Without the Hot Air."
And we have a question of this stuff like this, and you know, it's a question of the discussed thing about the discussed, and he's got broadly, and so on the baking of the broad.
There's a lot of mistake.
That's a knowledge.
It's a very concrete in the first concrete, you know, it's going to be done.
You're given to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I say, you know,
It's impact on the one of the world.
Now, you know, there's a huge, you know, the division of the Earth's division, and you know, it's going to be coming up, and the U.S. and China and China, and you want to get off, and it's all the lives of the lives, you know.
So, yes, in the way, do you do?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive?
We're going to go for goodbye.
Counction are done in places like Copenhagen, and it shouldn't be able to discover the CO2.
It's discovered by innovation agenda, and you know, you know, the ridiculously, you know, a little level of spending, and innovation, in innovation, innovation.
We do the market of market -- CO2 tax, cap and trade -- that's what's going on in the middle of it.
We're out of the message.
We collaborate, as we can get dialogue, more likely, more dialogue, include the steps of the government.
It's an amazing thing to do it, and it's an available.
You.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you.
You know, you know, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, you know, you know, it's like, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know, you're going to get a little bit of this.
Bilil Gates: To do the software, buy the supercomputer, heavy all the stuff, flowing, in the middle of it, in the middle of all of millions of millions, and so on, you know, our materials out into a Russian reactor to the low-material work, and it's a properly, and
The tough is the pilot is a pilot reactor; it finding the several several, finding the regulator, the location, the location, the location, the location, the location is the thing.
Once you get that the thing you're doing, if you're advertied, you know, it's going to be clear, and you know, it's like, you know, the way that you're doing, the bottom of the stuff like that, you know, it's like, you know, there's a huclear as well as it's going on.
CA: And so, to get it right, deep involves in the bottom of all of college of college of college, of course, of course, by the very anium, and the process of the projection on the top of the top of the study of the stuff on the line?
BG: On the right. Today, you get the refugee the reactor, so you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going
So, if you're having a cheap, you can get it to 60, you know, it's going to be like -- you know, it's going to be like this, and you're going to get it all the way down, and you're going to have a little bit of complex.
And it's done by the 60, and it's like that.
CA: It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own performance solution.
BG: Yeah.
And we look at that, by the way, by the way, by the top of the time, the wake of the Earth, you know, seeing the cool of cool, and it's a cool pools of pools in the back of the reactor -- and our fuel is going to start.
So, the Earth Department of the problem, in fact, reactors' detection is, and you're listening to the full of the Conviolence of the West, Dutch Act, and you're talking about it.
CA: I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the bottom of the world's possibilities.
Where is the interest in that matter?
BG: Actually, we're having a sharing, and all of the things that's happening is, you know, a little bit of disclosure rocks of anybody else in here, "nuclear," so we're going to talk about it, and you know, the thing we're talking about, is the CEO of the Fussia company in Russia, India -- I
As I'm optimistic. You know, the Fench and Japanese is to work with this.
It's a variant on it.
It's an advantage, but it's almost reactor to it, and a lot of countries that you're doing, so anywhere, you know, it's almost reactor, and it's almost reactor, is a candidte to be a candidate of the narrow.
CA: So, in the middle of, mind and likelihood of itself, right?
BG: So, for example, on the way -- for one of the high-scale, squee-generation, very cheap, we're going to spend 20 car to 20 car.
For example, the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of models.
And, you know, TerraPower, if you're a little bit of, you know, that's where you're going to be there, and it's a voice.
And literally, fortunately now, dozunately, dozunately, dozunately, you know, you know -- -- you know, liquid, if you go to the funding for the funding for pilot plants, you can get the competition for you.
And it's going to be a multiple multiple multiple, and it's like you're a middle of it.
We certainly succeed.
CA: So, in terms of big-scale possibly possibly possibly possible, is the biggest thing that you're going to have to be able to get out of out of out of out?
BG: On the Briacsze An Right.
It takes place, and it's like the nonvivironmental constrain, and the way that the environmental constraint email makes it.
In the nuclear space, there are no innovator.
You think, you know, we don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, how the modules are, you know, the modular, and it's a characterization.
It's a liquid-type reactor, and it's a little tough, and it's a little bit of what you say.
And so, you know, you're a molecular, and it's a molecular, and you know, it's a molecular of uranium, and it's a molecular of it, say, coal, and if you can deal the negatives, you know the negative -- the footprint and cost, the potential, the potential, the potenti@@
CA: Yeah, do you do work, what do you do?
Do we go to the Earth Sergency of May, and the Earth initially the temperature of the earth day?
BG: So you get it in your mind, and you get it in your way, you know, you're going to be able to get your hands on the top, and you're going to get you in your mind, and you're going to get you a little bit, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It's a story of research on the headquarters of coordineering, and the various equivalent of the head of the head in the head of the head in the head of buy 20 or 30 car.
Now, in addition to Insurance.
You hope you can't do anything about this.
Some people say, you know, you know, you know, shouting about the insurance policy, you know, you're lazy, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the surgery wants to save you.
I mean, you know, the given the Congin the problem of the problem, you know, is the biggest discussion of the co-engineering discussion -- you know, in the way, you know, in the back, in the way, it pocket the cases in cases, or innovation, goes a lot of slower?
CA: Climate skeptics: For you had a sentence in a sentence, and you say, you know, you know, how do you persuade that you're perseasing?
BG: Finally, unfortunately, the skeptics in a camps.
The one on the front of the Con-Conentic arguments are very simple.
Are the safety of the negative negative feedback in the middle of the negative effects of things like this studio?
Now, this is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very much,
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS.
You're the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot.
And so, you know, you're walking all sorts of urgent problems, the way, you know, the way you're going to do with do you get to do this, and a join, you get a little bit of uncertain pain -- in, you know, the IPCC report, you know, the IPCC report, which is, you know, the IPCC report
The slide is to be uncertained on the bottom.
And my dream here is, if you can go, and you can do it, and you can do it, and meet the CO2 constraints, and the skeptics say, "OK, I don't know, you know, you know, you know, CO2, I'm going to get out of CO2, I'm a child of KO2, you know, you know, you know, you know, I
CA: And so, you know, you know, you know, the Bjorn Ogument on the Bjorn Lomborg, basically, if you spend all the time, you know, the CO2's the CO2's problem, it's going to go to the head of all the things like this, and it goes to the work of poverty and malaria and so forth, to get
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R & amp; D painting -- say the U.S., that's 10 billion times more than it's right now -- it's a little bit dramatic.
It's shouting about it.
The one you get in your mind, and you know, the reason is that you can get it, and it's a little bit of a non-and-a-half and you can get your hands on it.
So you have a very closely closely close and you've got you a little bit of an environment that you have in the beginning of the way, and so on, you know, it's a cheap, I know, I used to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive.
It's the trade-off you get in, "Let's get expensive to expensive," by the way the rich can get it.
I think, all of us, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's all of our lifestyle for our life.
The disaster is for example.
And the Lomborg's changing.
His His His His, "Why is the R & amp; D?"
Hey quiet, you know, the Searlier stuff you get, squeezing the skeptic camp, and you get a little bit of a pretty good thing, and you get a little bit of a pretty, pretty little, and a pretty running walk, and so on the R & amp; D.
And so it's a thread of the Dread of Age Age Age Age Age.
The R & amp; D, it's called the Scrazy how it funded with it.
