Several , Skillman &apos;s Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow .
And the very pretty simple pretty simple : teams of the Middle At the test standing up the talling of the test , you know , the test of the stuff of spaghetti , and one yard of tape , and one yard of Street , and one yard of a marshmallow .
The marshmallow hand is to be .
And , in fact , it &apos;s a very simple thing , and it &apos;s a hard thing about pretty pretty much that it &apos;s a little bit of collaborator in collaborate very quickly .
And so I think about what was going on , and I incorporated it into a design key .
And so what a huge is looking for .
And then , you know , I &apos;m going to be 70 designed in 70 design , and I designed and designers and architects , the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and the CTexercise of Earth &apos;s exercise is exercise to reveal the most deep of collaboration , and I &apos;ve got the job of it .
So , normally , it began to be an oriented themselves in the world .
On the way , characteristics out of it , as you get to , you know , overwhelmed .
It &apos;s the way that you &apos;re planning for the time that you &apos;re planning , organizing , and you &apos;ve got a little bit of chain , and you &apos;ve got out of spaghetti .
This is the majority of the animate of the sticks with the sticks into ever-tools .
And then finally , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s all the way out of the marshmallow , and it &apos;s like , and it turns out , and it was like , and it was like , and it was like , and it was standing , and it was a day , and it was a day , and it was a charge .
For example , it &apos;s like , at the end of the day , is called the Tuh-oh , &quot; Conting , &quot; Comm-of-the-marshhallow &quot; collaborator &quot; collapse . &quot;
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of stuff like this , you know , you know , you know , Moh-oh , and a lot of the stuff , and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates .
Something , you know , cheat , map distracted and functional and so forth .
And of course , by the time , by the time , by the time , by the time , &quot; tend &quot; and &quot; tac-da &quot; -- and there &apos;s a huge on the Congress , and among the absolutely recent graduate .
And it goes .
From the Peter , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s the things that &apos;s really done , you know , it &apos;s the most important thing to do this .
So the way the way you &apos;re doing , is that ? Why ? What is it ?
And Peter likes to say , you know , none of the Middle Effert , a CEO of Spaghetti , Inc. Right ?
It &apos;s not a good job in the spend of jockeal power .
It &apos;s a very good job .
And the reason is a business of business , trained to the sound right now , right ?
And then , execute on it .
And , by the time , is that the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top , call out of the mouth of it .
It was a crisis .
By family ? Right .
What cinder-do do differentiate is the marshmallow , and the shelter prototypes , successive prototypes , checking the marshmallow , so multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way .
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project .
And then , rather version , it &apos;s getting more constrained in the bottom , and it &apos;s a little bit of work .
So the way the way that the world is , in prototype to play is essential , and let &apos;s get a little bit about how the trial is performing .
So the average for the average is , you know , in the average , by 20 Indian ; business schools , and a half of them , lawyer , a character , you know , a downtown , kindergared , funny , evidence .
Who does this matter ?
Architect and Engineer , thankful .
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world .
And that &apos;s what ? Does have been patterns and self-cleanly geetetrical powers in the world .
So CEOs , a piece of an announcement , a little bit of the CEOs , and there was an average .
You put you on the executive administration of the team , the significantly .
It &apos;s called you . You &apos;re going to be like you , you go , you go , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Win the way . &quot;
You can do it . You can get it .
It &apos;s a little bit of skills of divertation .
And there are the project that project .
And whatever , you know , team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team .
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong .
So you &apos;re going to be able to do it by 10 , typically , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get you a little bit of this kind of thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , you get a little bit of the same thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s in the way that you &apos;re doing .
And I tried .
I do , let &apos;s go once .
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning .
So , how do you know , how do you get to be done with that , and design is design ?
What does the rest ?
For example , it was not a standing team .
Now , anyone had a little bit , say , &quot; As one in the middle of the world , &quot; Don &apos;t get the price .
Like , isn &apos;t it ? However stacking , staces , staces , stacking , stacking .
We energized the exercise on the exercise .
What do you do ?
So now , the week of prototyping .
So , the very thing about the very way to do the work is to be the very important .
At the tallest , the tallest in the least , the test of the brain .
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives and successful .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a marshmallow , you know , you &apos;re a marshmallow ?
And the reason is , I &apos;m making a processing tools and processing the processes with a team cars and video in visual effects .
And the marshmallow is challenged to help you get the identify bottle of the day .
Frankly , frankly , it project a marshmallow , but it &apos;s like ?
And so , the job provides provides a challenge , and a slide of a long time , a little bit of a purpose to build the right .
And so , you know , the value of the City of the City of the City of the exercise .
And the thing about you guys are going to go to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It &apos;s just a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of your marshmallows .
Final by-step-by-step-by-and-by-steps .
It &apos;s not a crazy deployment of the stuff that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like that &apos;s going to be the movement of what &apos;s going on .
You know , there &apos;s an autonomous type of people who are there .
And the fundamental Lessy , I say , is a design design , is a contact .
It demanded the way we bring it all from our sensory to the world , and then we got the very series of our own , and we got the very slightly like our own , our fellow and our case to the challenge .
And , you know , a prototype of a prototype of this is all the way to turn it into the turn of the way to turn it on , &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a tag .
And that &apos;s a little bit differently .
You &apos;re very much .
Let &apos;s get a little predent right now .
A more machine , a cool , TEDish machine , and it machine , it machine .
And then you get it in the way to get it into it .
And you can go , you can go forward , you can go forward , you can &apos;t have you yourself .
And I wonder , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was boreful , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and you know , all the way to go .
I don &apos;t know , I think , to go to go to go to go to go back to the Contest Everthy or Twitter , &quot; American Idol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I was Convinced , and I think of it , of pull to nostalgia , to knowing you .
And I do .
I mean , I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say .
I don &apos;t know about to go back , and it &apos;s called an adventurous way .
It &apos;s offering the possibilities of being planet , and it goes on to be done , and it &apos;s like , you know , it goes back , and Congo .
As I do to get it in the machine , and I was born in the machine .
This is the transition of the coast of the coast of the machinery , and it &apos;s based on a planet , and it &apos;s basically choose to choose , and it &apos;s like mobility , an audience , declining rates of disease ...
It was a matter of mind .
My great-grandparents , all of the things , by the time , is 60 .
My grandparent pushed in 70 .
My participation mosquitos close in 80 .
This is how it was a nine at the beginning of my death .
It &apos;s a little bit of it that &apos;s in the middle of it , which is a bigger deal .
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi , excited to live exception to live in the world , you know , the world in the world is 100 .
Think , you know , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to be done .
And does it happen ?
Smallpox . Smallpox killed a billion-billion-plan .
It was reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way , and it was not a mistake .
It &apos;s called it . It was to be a silent .
We vanquish it . Puff .
In the same time , it was huge , threatless millions of itself , which is a longer extraordinary , hardly .
Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
What do you do anyone &apos;s doing it ?
Vaccine , modern medicine , our ability to be fed billions , and the Con-entific concern of the Center method .
And to my mind , the Centh method -- stuff out out , searched if it works , it changed the way to go -- is on the top of the Saccomplishm of humanity .
That &apos;s the way that it &apos;s called .
Infortunately , in fact , all the way news the way , it &apos;s all the way , and it &apos;s a little bit problems , and it turns out , and it &apos;s done .
And one of it is that all our accomplishments all our accomplishments , a trillion of goes to get to get hongry in your head .
Bring , and it goes to a very rapidly shared , and it goes to a very rapidly , and it &apos;s discovered .
And , in fact , we &apos;re going to be able to find out of imagination to the thoroughly drash .
Potal water , Arablands , rainforests , oil , gas , it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , in fact , in the middle of it , and innovate , innovate , and innovate in the way out of it , we know .
So the thing is , Can we do ? And I can do it .
I mean it was clear to be able to do it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a billion of the Earth Rain , which is a living , and it &apos;s a living .
I &apos;m going to have a power of power , which is the destroy of technology .
I do it , and I don &apos;t know it &apos;s going to be in the way in the way .
Every one of the world &apos;s heavy keeps coming up with the top of the Earth keeps -- one of the Earth Cheeps , and he said , &quot; We &apos;re progressing progress in the Conence more than that right now . Never .
And so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can .
We are the verge of amazing , and yet I &apos;ve gone to go to go to go to go back to go to go to go back to 300 , and the Enlightenment , to the British Age Age , and he was going to be a matter of the Congress , and he was going to be a little bit of limb , and he was going to be front of the th@@
Peating wrap in the mind , and it &apos;s so ugly the way you can do it .
On the audience wants to go .
And , listening , contemplated with an opinion -- the Contled purpose to surprise the progress .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You chose entirely on your own . Sorry , you know .
And hang out to the figure out .
There &apos;s a story of above a story , I wrote a story , Vaccine for The New Yorker .
And I think about it , I think , opposition to the opposition to it is , it &apos;s all of the stuff that &apos;s effective public , and it &apos;s like to be an excellent public .
I do to do it , I do , like , I do , I wrote , I wrote a story , and I was a mobile .
And so , I wrote a story , I wrote a story , of the genetically engineered food .
Same one , more bigger .
Pew &apos;s Druzy .
So I wrote a story about this story , and I was pulling together , and the Frankenfoods , which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark , rather than a haphazard way , and what &apos;s triggering itself , and what &apos;s going to happen .
You know , you &apos;re doing it , I do , I do the story , I wrote the story , I was mobion .
I do , I was a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re going , we &apos;re going to dinner . It was a little bit .
And thanthfully , thanthfully , and I was born , and I couldn &apos;t do some people out there , and eventually I do .
And in the middle of God , Congy mazes are going to be great , fantatics are going to be fantatically .
Same amazing thoughful , educated equipment .
It &apos;s also , you know , exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same .
And it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
As I do , you know , you &apos;ve got to you .
And we asked a lot in the world , and we don &apos;t know , in the car , the relationship of relationship in the world .
We do it ambivalding .
We &apos;re in ironic terms , &quot; Congress . &quot;
OK , I think , well , it &apos;s great reason for that , and I was going to be able to think about it .
We &apos;re going to be able to institutions in the institutions , in authority , and it &apos;s in love , and it &apos;s a little bit of a reason we shouldn &apos;t go .
You can say , &quot; You can say , &quot; and you want to be able to do it .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass deeply , hanging .
You can , you can get you can do it .
It &apos;s a little bit of this stuff that &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s a little bit of a problem that &apos;s going to be a little bit of serious about it .
Ask : Accumpally , the request of all , demand evidence .
Don &apos;t work anything .
So here , you get a little bit of this stuff : you &apos;re going to get a little bit , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a way to accept your account .
And the reason I can say , the idea is that , in an epidemic of the epidemic of being , you know , there &apos;s an Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and you &apos;re in the middle of the watch .
About 12 , which is a story that was published , a horrible story , a horrible story , the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
Very scary .
Tons of stuff is going to be looking at severe of the study of seeing what &apos;s true .
For example , tons of study like this , it &apos;s serious issues .
The job .
The bottom of the United States is called the United States , in England , the U.S. , the U.S. , Danada , and what all the things are : no correlation , no one , no one , no one .
It &apos;s worth doing it . It &apos;s a matter of matter , and it &apos;s a matter of character , we know , we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen , and you can do it .
We don &apos;t have a bunch of documents , and we have a government officially , and I do , I know , I said I was doing all do .
You know ?
The results of this is an announced .
Disastrous , Disastrous : The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs of the Earth &apos;s vaccine rate for measles .
It &apos;s discovery , and it &apos;s an ashamed of Ahamed .
It was horrible .
What about a child of that was ?
Now now , I do . I do it .
Do you see , you know , there &apos;s some kind of maps of maps ?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles ?
And there are very much .
Again , in fact , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like 160,000 in the payload .
There &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 .
On the heart of it , it &apos;s going to be done , and we can put it out of our minds , and you know , Jenny McCarthy can be preachingly preaching me , and Eilliteracy , &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot;
And you can do that , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work and correlation .
It &apos;s not very much , though , that &apos;s the bottom line , but it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s all the way .
And it goes up to that , and we learned that to be a little bit .
So , you know , the guy , Jonas Salk .
Heap of the situation of some of the crucial of some of them .
No fear , no agony . Polio -- puff , gone .
And this is what &apos;s going on in the middle , which is that .
His name is Paul Offit .
Hey hey , a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff .
It was the lives of the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning .
Pretty , right ?
Actually , Paul Paul goes to go , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like vaccine , and it &apos;s like vaccine , and it &apos;s like vaccine , and you &apos;re going to be like vaccine , and you &apos;re going to go to the point of work , and you can &apos;t get the
And then it goes on .
So , Paul &apos;s Ana terrorist .
And Paul Depaks , which is , you know , the CEO Paul goodbye , and he &apos;s going to go to the Council , you know , it &apos;s going to be a big testify .
Hey , and he asked him to go , and he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , and he remembered him to go to school , she remembered him .
And hold , Do Paul was vaccine .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t say , say , vaccines are essential .
You see , you have a disease , you know , horrible discussing , and you get it .
We human measles in the world .
And it goes , and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty much car , and so forth , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
And you know , that &apos;s what the of measles are .
What is the polio ? Let &apos;s go on . Why ?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of couples , and she was a mine , and she was a little bit of an education .
There &apos;s no one .
She switched into the vaccine , you know , a polio , no way .
Fine .
Why ? Are we going to have a polio .
We &apos;re going to be the polio in the hyesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a great thing , and this is a great thing to planning in Lagos in Lagos , and he &apos;s going to go to LAX , right now , right now .
And then , you know , there &apos;s a bunch of Hours in a couple of hours of hours , and you get a car , and then you get a little bit of time to the Long Beach , and then you get a little bit of a little bit of fabulous TED dinner .
And then , you know , there &apos;s a lot of infected , you know , it &apos;s a paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t know , you know , it &apos;s all the way that the answer is in the bottom .
And the planet is the planet , and it prevented itself .
Now , let &apos;s move forward in a time , and we &apos;re doing it .
Do you want to get there in a morning vitamin tomorrow ?
Echinacea , a type of antioxidant to get you .
I have to do it in the U.S.
So the stuff of the stuff , and it &apos;s called alternative medicines , and it &apos;s like a matter of people who often do with the top of it , and it would be called the way that it would be done .
All the matters of all the things .
By the way , it requires it .
It &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re a little billion dollars , you know ?
I &apos;m doing you .
That &apos;s where it &apos;s about , Dark .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ?
For example , I was there , I was having a big charma .
We have characteristics . We don &apos;t know .
And we shouldn &apos;t go and look at the care of the stuff .
It makes a cruel millions of millions .
It was a cold of the Earth Railway and soul-to-and-detailed cold .
So how do you get it like this , and so forth do ?
We leave into the arm of Big Placebo .
It &apos;s a fantastic . I do Big Placebo .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you know , it &apos;s a serious one , and it &apos;s a nice thing , and we &apos;re billions of dollars on it .
And I heard all sorts of things like this .
No of it -- gindgo , fresh ; echinacea , frow ; I don &apos;t have to have a case of mind , and we have a mistake billion of dollars on dollars on dollars on it -- it &apos;s going to be frozen .
And you &apos;re talking ? At you , I say , you know , I &apos;m going to ask you , and I say , &quot; What do you do ? Let &apos;s do you do things like this .
It doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
And you ? You see , you &apos;re wrong .
And I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , in the outside of HHS , and I said , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to have a huge the evidence of the EEFs of my experts on my stuff on my stuff on my expert on a little bit , &quot; or simply , you know , scanctics quack to measuring patient &apos;s
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
From up up to Thabo Mberki South Africa .
Hey killed 400,000 of His in Insisting , Garlic and lemon and limon the antiretroviral press the antiretroviral of the antiretroviral of AIDS .
Hundreds of the Earthern Dutath-death , in a hand , has been plagued to be a plagued than any of them in the world .
Please , don &apos;t have no consequences to it .
It &apos;s pretty much .
Now , the model of mindum epidemic , in the middle of right now , it &apos;s a proponent of the proponent of genetically engineered food , and the organic elite .
It &apos;s called idio debate . It &apos;s a huge thing .
It &apos;s a debate , and it &apos;s called metaphor .
It &apos;s an ideology , it &apos;s going to be done .
Every single cells , you know , Every single , you know , the rice of the rice , the sprint of parsley , the Brusss sprout a lot of you .
You think , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to talk about it in the garden of Eden .
This is a crush , and it turns out to be a little bit of christmas . We do it all .
We &apos;re going to be 11,000 .
And it goes and forth about it .
We &apos;re talking about the stuff .
Now , now we can do it in a more precise way -- and it can be the risks , absolutely -- but we can put it on a lovely vitamin A into the rice , and the stuff can be done by millions of times , millions of times , projecting .
You don &apos;t have to do anything to do ?
I said , I don &apos;t know it .
We object in the genetically genetically engineered .
Why do we do ?
For example , the As Constantly constantly -- Too &apos;s chemicals , pestr , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a lot of game of the game of the stuff that &apos;s going on .
We don &apos;t know companies patent life .
We don &apos;t have a companies of owning .
And you have my response to all of it ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s get free with it .
It &apos;s getting true , it &apos;s a huge food problem .
It &apos;s a little bit of type of doing that .
It &apos;s a bunch of patent on it .
You &apos;re going to be a company .
It was himself .
It &apos;s in the middle of it ; it &apos;s a project .
It &apos;s a profit , and it &apos;s a project like that , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , but the way the background is that the base , whereas the thing we &apos;re doing is that the thing we call the Araid , is that the thing we call the Araid , is the very deader , and it was a little bit of preventing millions of
You think , in the way 50 , you know , you &apos;re going to be horrible to go on to be great 70 , you know , it &apos;s about -- you know , it &apos;s about -- you know , it &apos;s going to be about -- you know , there &apos;s about it right now , 70 .
investment in Africa over the load 30 .
Disgrubful . Disgrania .
It &apos;s going to get it , and it &apos;s going to be that , and it &apos;s going to be the car .
And that &apos;s genetically Engineered .
We don &apos;t have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with , you know , stuck with the stuff , and we don &apos;t get stuck with them .
Cassava was a huge huge .
It &apos;s a child of a potato .
It &apos;s a bunch of calories . It sucks .
It &apos;s called it , and it &apos;s called a protein , and it &apos;s protein , and it &apos;s a little bit of engineering in industry that &apos;s going on in it right now .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get there with a bunch of work .
Woum , and you do it ?
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s wouting , you know , Chez Panisse .
And all I can say , &quot; Why are the thing we &apos;re going to shoot ?
I do , let &apos;s go back to this : Why are we going to be shaping ?
Are we going to move the way to the move ?
It &apos;s literally , is that it &apos;s not living . It &apos;s not a chemicle .
It &apos;s intensive to be ridiculous in hormones for hormones , our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment , or less food , whose food .
You know , it &apos;s called the Rice Krispie , which is the thing that it &apos;s in the head of charring , and it &apos;s in charge of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s a moment in the middle of it .
You know , you know ?
We don &apos;t know , if you get continuity to the eight-way , you know , we have a little bit of a good idea , and we &apos;re going to be a good job of it , and you &apos;re going to be a good thing about it , and you &apos;re going to be a good thing about this : high-tech colonialism .
There is no way to get to the Council Resk .
It &apos;s kind of selfish , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s in the way , it &apos;s going to be a little bit , and it goes on the car on it .
So , as a result , you have conversation , you &apos;re conversation , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , you squirt it into an amazing machinery in an amazing machine and go ? &quot;
Absolutely . Absolutely , I do .
It was in the present right now right now , but we &apos;re going to an amazing .
We can make a bunch of stuff on anyway .
We can move it on the line , and we can move it , and we &apos;d like to move the way , on the middle of the day , and then literally move the way to move it .
We do it conversations , and we &apos;re going to make a car , and then we &apos;ll get it in the machine , and we &apos;re going to get there in the machine , and we &apos;re going , and we &apos;re going to go on .
I was going to do it , and as an amazing thing about being concerts , and it &apos;s right now .
You .

I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve , and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have to have music shape , bond , and ultimately the instrumental -- if you &apos;re in pardon &apos;s pop -- in helping Na@@
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , Disney Concert at Concert .
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth , symphony , and the patterns himking and introduced .
Hey , what happened to be a very young jovial and gregarious mobility , and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the Dodgers to go to the World Series , all of the Central Avount to the Council of Earth Folin in the load movement of Beethoven &apos;s
And we had music music , and I was in email to Steve , and I said yes , and so , you know , nice , you know , M.C. , you know , you know , night , you know , night , and you saw a violin .
Now , I &apos;m going to refer to Nathaniel refuses , you know , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to take you a little bit of a shock of therapy and Thorazine and handling , and the Corazine , and it &apos;s a stayed for his entire life .
From now , it &apos;s a trained to be a trained to a shark called a schizophrenic epish , the worst of the Molophrenic Serro of Muifest him , and Dozo , Dody Dumpearing for days , whereing the street of Skid Row , exposed to its own , and the Toral
And Nathaniel , which is a state of agitation , and he &apos;s going to go to the Walt Disney Concert , and he said , a child of manic glorious glint in Hall of Hall of the eyes .
And then I &apos;m going to smoke invisible demand , and how the poisoning him in his sleep .
And I do what Araid , you know , you know what &apos;s Araid , you know , you know what &apos;s going on , you know , &quot; Don &apos;t be a little bit of work into one of his states , and II Britain , &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin , and AK : After all the time , and you know , the arpeggi@@
So , I was playing .
And I played the Concobian &apos;s Comethoven Violin Concerto .
And as I played , I was determined by what a project is a profound of a project in Nathaniel .
It &apos;s what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceuit-map reaction , a chemical reaction , for my plays music music , of catalyst .
And Nathaniel , manic a little bit of the transformed into a lot , a quick curiosity and grade .
And in a miracle , lifeline , at the middle of lifeline , and he &apos;s going to be playing by ear , certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of abundance -- birth , Tchaikovsky , Siberius .
And we have music music , Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B , the Bartók , all the way up to Ete-Peka Salona .
And I have a huge death in the middle of encyclopedic , biggest music of music , but related to the neighborhoods of related to a music .
Hey , you spoke to the child of the child of happening and a continuous hand , and I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
And playing music , and I had music , and you had a transcended in the paranoid , you disturbed the Earth CEO of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , enjoying , brilliant , Juilliard-trained .
Music is medicine . Music changes .
And for Nathaniel , music is it .
It had to be done with a music allows , and it has to be huge , and so forth and delush and creativity , in reality .
And it &apos;s an essential hit state .
And I &apos;m going to have to remember what the very sence of species .
So , what the very reason was like , in the middle of it , in the first place , we had to be able to exist in all of us , and our very fundamental core , our emotions , and all the kind of thing , our creativity , we could have a shape in the reality of a shape .
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves , inspiring and unitable .
And for Nathaniel , he needed music breathing him back into a fold of term .
The redeme power of music brown back to him to a family of family behind him , and it was a huge rest of it , and she was offered , and she was offered him .
And I want to get a music of M.thaniel , which is the Wold Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , which is a neighborhood that I was getting to be a name .
You .
Bruno Giussani : Your you . Thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I was like to play with you , I was hugely celebrating .
So , please shape .
I Jane McGonigal . I did a game designer .
I &apos;m going online official online , and my goal for the size of my goal to the size is to cash the way to get it to get the way to be able to see the thing in real life in real life , in real life , and it &apos;s actually save the way to see the thing in real life .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plan for it , and it &apos;s a little bit of convincing more than that , including all of you , to spend more powerful and a matter .
Right now we spend a little bit of a billion-playing game .
So , Some of you would be like , &quot; Comea , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of playing .
Magic , consider considering , considering the way that &apos;s going on in the real . &quot;
For example , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , the opposite is true .
Three hours of hours a week is not a little bit nearly a little bit more than the way the world &apos;s intense problems .
In the middle of the day , I was born if the survival of survival the Earth century , we were in the car , in the car , in the car , in the car , the way I was doing is dramatically dramatically .
I entered Calculated the totally , 21 trillion hours of game .
So , the thing about this is a co-intuitive , so I say , let &apos;s say it &apos;s going to be funny , poverty , poverty , funny , climate conflict , whereas , I said , &quot; Do we go to the aspire -- you get 21 billion hours a week , by the bottom of the stuff .
No . I don &apos;t know . I am .
Same .
I think , the Prture pretty much fuzzy , and I said , &quot; On-S-Age Age Age Age Age Age Surkey Age Age Office . &quot; Truly .
It &apos;s a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano .
Hey to the emotion of the emotion of gaming , this is how a camera that is camera in front of gamers .
And it &apos;s a classic gaming emotion .
Now , if you don &apos;t have a gamer , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of the stuff that you &apos;re going to be in the photo .
You see , you see the Age of urgency , you know , it &apos;s a bunch of stage , and you &apos;re a little bit of intense concentration , the deep focus on a taccling and a level of the problem .
You &apos;re going to have you &apos;re going to be a gamer , you want to be a little bit of novels , the Crinkle of the eyes , and the Mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrow up is a surprise .
It &apos;s a good-off of &quot; epic . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;re a little bit of it .
OK , well , you know , that &apos;s the way that it goes in here .
In epic win is that extraordinarily positive , you had nothing to do with what &apos;s literally incredibly incredibly incredibly incredible to it .
It &apos;s an ancient hyond the threshold of imagination , and you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of discover
This is the epic .
It &apos;s a gamer on the verge of epic .
And on the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the U.S. , to the top of the Earstacle of the Fine century -- the understanding of the Earth century -- the understanding of the Age of the Age Council , all the odd , is on the verge of epic .
Now now , unfortunately , the face of the face of the face is that season in the face of the face , in the end life , listening to a tacker .
An Not At At At Life , I Fow Life At Life .
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you see , it &apos;s like . Can you see you see ? Yes . Good .
It &apos;s the &quot; I Now Good At Life . &quot;
It &apos;s a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , I think of the P.D. , I think it was in real life in real life .
And it &apos;s a problem , and it &apos;s a problem of it .
We &apos;re going to be able to do it in real reality , and we &apos;re going to be in this .
I don &apos;t know how to do it in Successful , although , although , of it .
We do it in game .
So I have a massive metric to do it in motivated to do -- inspred and cooperate .
And on the middle of God , I was doing this stuff , I think , the Moly-Dovered of Earth -- the English of the English , the Enlikely to get a moment , and the English stick with a moment , the English to stick out of a problem , and it was a problem , and it was a problem
And in real life , in the middle of the face of the front , you know , the way we confront obstacles , you know , we don &apos;t see anything .
We &apos;re overhead , as we move towards , we &apos;re anxious , depressed , frustrated or cynical .
We &apos;re going to have a little bit of source , which is a little bit of game , and it &apos;s really in the middle of it .
So , I think I was a graduate student , I think , a graduate student .
What do you think about the impossic to the people who do you get ?
And so , can we do it , and it goes , and it goes up to the real way to get a little bit of work on it ?
So I look at the World of Warcraft , the ideal collaborative problem-solving problem .
And I have a case to notice in the middle of noisy , which is so possible in online .
The Tustice is a show you show you , and you look at the one of the Old of Warcraft , which is the pecially least lots of character to character , you know , telling you a little bit mission , right .
And there was a mission that was a mission of a mission , and it was perfected in the world .
Right ? So you can do it .
It &apos;s a challenge you can do it .
With the version of it , it &apos;s a very definition of the way that you &apos;re talking about .
There is no insucyment in World of Warcraft ; no searching , wrying , whinging , the series of the Sific and a half .
So this is the tons of collaborator .
So , Everything you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , the Hundred-sand , and all of this stuff , and you get to work on their own .
Eventually , in real life , in real life , which is our fingertips , and it &apos;s our fingertips in collaborator .
And the epic of the story , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called the story of the front of the day , and it goes up , and then we get a little bit of positive feedback .
You &apos;re going to be a little bit of life at leveling , + 1 strength , + 1 intelligence .
We don &apos;t eat the child of constant feeding in real life .
Actually I do it , I don &apos;t know , I think , in a moment , and I was a fake , and a crazy person , and 20 crazy .
I don &apos;t have to do it in real life .
Now , the problem with a collaborative online , the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be the leading across the verge of the movement of epic , in epics of epic , in epics of epics all the time , and the decide spend all our very best in the very way .
It &apos;s a reality of reality .
So , in fact , collectively all the World of Warcraft , you spent 5.93 , which is the virtual problems of Ashoth .
Now , in a narrow path , it &apos;s a bad .
It &apos;s absolutely asking you to do it .
Right : 5.93 in the context : 5.93 .
It &apos;s the machinery of what the machinery .
So , as we like to think about it , as it &apos;s like , you know , the way that we have a little investing in plain investing in a plain , the way to do it , the way it does to get the car to do it is to get it to be the magnitude of the brain evolution , is to extraordinary .
So it &apos;s going to be done by doing that , and it &apos;s going to be done by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by spending all the things that matters , and then it goes up , and then it &apos;s going to be done , and we &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of it in the world .
We trained to be a more collaborative and it &apos;s about it .
It &apos;s true . I do .
So , considers of the statistic , it &apos;s a statistic ; it &apos;s a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young one , and he said that , in fact , a strongly official region wants 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours of games , by the age of
Now , 10,000 hours is a huge thing about it .
First of all , for example in the United States , 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school , which is a great deal with high school graduation , if you have a perfect breathing .
So , we &apos;re having a parallel track of education , and it &apos;s now having to be able to do it in a table way to go to a gamer , and it &apos;s a low-camer , and it &apos;s a low-camer .
Some of you have been the Rounce Rad Malcolm Gladwell , who &apos;s called &quot; Outliers , &quot; which is how you have a theory of &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory . &quot;
It &apos;s based on a cognitive type of cognitive , you know , that we can &apos;t get a thousand hours of an awful lot of effortly study at the bottom , and anybody at the age of 21 , we want to be virtuosos .
We want to be aspired to do , in fact , do you do it .
And so , now , now , now , in the middle of it , it was an entire generation of young virtuoso .
So , &quot; What &apos;s the exaccement of that ? &quot;
So , if you look at a little bit , you know , it &apos;s a viral unprecedented unprecedented , you know , it &apos;s going to be resource .
This is what &apos;s called the AK in the world , and it &apos;s a day playing a day .
Consider virtuoso , 500 people who are extraordinarily at all .
And in the case , in the case , in the car , the reports of the time , the most extraordinarily addressed .
You don &apos;t do anything like this , and it &apos;s all the way .
The game industry , the game industry is , you know , the way we can go and work on the effect of the painting phone network instead of broadband Internet , so it goes all over the world , and the Bracil , Bracil , can get it online .
There &apos;s a billion-dollar animal more than it was in the salary .
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion .
So I think of the way , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think it &apos;s a virtuoso .
You know , it &apos;s the way that the world I &apos;ve got to do , is that the thing you &apos;re doing .
OK , yet , it &apos;s a very odd motivation .
Usgent optimism is the desire to devotion of the immediately towardly , combined , populated population in the middle of it , which is a hopeful bias .
Gamers who have been done at epic win is the possibility of the idea , and it &apos;s at the end of it , and it &apos;s now .
Gamers don &apos;t know how to do it .
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time .
For example , this is a lot of stuff , and it &apos;s a little bit of a shop showing , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a little bit of a badly .
And the reason is that it &apos;s a huge amount of trouble to play with a game .
We want to be able to think about it , and we &apos;re going to be a bit of a bunch , and it wants to be a little bit of fuel , value , which is the game , and it &apos;s the game .
And so , plaza &apos;s game , bonds and cooperation .
And we look at the bright stronger of relationship with a character .
Blissful Right . I do it .
You think , you know , at the average World of Warcraft games , you &apos;re going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half of a half a table .
It &apos;s the way that it was going to be a game , and it goes behind it , and so forth , as well , the beautiful animal is going to be a little bit of time , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit of relaxy , or we &apos;re going to go out of it .
We &apos;re going to be optimized as we &apos;re going to be optimizized as usual , to do hard and meaning work .
And he goes to work with work hard all the things , whether it &apos;s the right thing to work .
Finally : epic meaning .
Gamers &apos;s joined up to awa-inspiring absolute fuels to the planetary scales .
So , by the way , it &apos;s a little bit of trivia , and you &apos;re going to get it in personal condition , and you &apos;re going to get you all the Wikipedia , bigger wild in the way .
Second biggest voice in the bottom , which is the World of Warcraft .
So if you want to do this , Five is going to be done .
Now , compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody &apos;s topic covered at the bottom of it .
It &apos;s not a matter of epic .
This is the World of Warcraft &apos;s World of Warcraft .
OK , this is the way we look at the top , and it &apos;s like , you know , Gamers are going to be super powers hopeful hopeful .
That &apos;s not the case of this stuff individually , individually , individually in the world .
And the bottom of the problem is , the ancient of the absolute virtual of changing virtual , and in fact the real .
At the problem , the problem of the problem with the world .
This is what happened to be named Edward Castronova .
His work is brilliant .
Hey looks at the end of the time , the investment of the investing that was going on , and it &apos;s all the way to go in online .
And then , &quot; We suspect , &quot; We suspected from the anounts to no one , but a mass exodus to virtual , online , online . &quot;
And then , you know , it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s going to be done .
And then , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be designed , I &apos;m going to be designed , I &apos;m getting exuberant .
For example , there &apos;s a perfect thing that can be done in the middle of the Earth &apos;s announcement , which is to be done in online in real life itself in real life .
It &apos;s a non-threshold of relationship in games , in the way , and you can get it in real life , and you get it in a moment , and you get a little bit more effective , and you get a little bit more likely to be in real life in real life .
So , for now , for now , perfect the time , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfectly , is to spend more than virtual words , than the real thing .
Now now , I was rational , for now .
Finally , by whatever it is , is that situation .
We car the real work , and we get more and more .
I am inspiration , I think , is 2,500 .
That &apos;s the case of this ancient , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sheep of sheep .
At the time we had had a bunch of awesome , we had had had a sheep sky .
And yet the case of the case , real equipment designed by the moment , and if you had a family of the science of the CEO of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , this is the history of an invented .
Herodotus determined , but it &apos;s a lot of herodotus , which is the first invented in the Kingdom of Lydia , who was allowed by a family of famine .
Apparants , what a severe family of Lydia decided was to do with do the crazy of the story .
Pejar housing for peek . Peaking machine .
It &apos;s in extreme situation , and it &apos;s extremely solution .
So , according to herodotus , and you know , the first thing about it , and you get a bunch of chingdom-wearthy policy : On one day , you know , and on the way , and on the way , on the way , on the one day , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of a moment .
And then , you know , there &apos;s so immerent in playing the dice , and you know , that &apos;s true , and you know , it &apos;s kind of like this gaging , and you &apos;re not going to be in satisfying , blish , actual , non-ignore , and you know , the ancient genoes that you have had no food to do .
And then on the front , it was a very short story , and on the way , on the way , on the way .
And according to herodotus , and it passed 18 across , survival , a family , by eating on the one day , and playing on the bottom .
So now , it &apos;s a very exactly , I think , how do we go .
We &apos;re going to get a real real-hand , and we got to get the game on it in the world , and you get rid of it , you know , broacing broads in the real environment , which is a very satisfying thing in the real time , and we &apos;re going to be in the middle of it .
With the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit .
It &apos;s an exciting thing .
According to herodotus , which is an 18 machinery of the name , which is the story that the decipherent of the science is going to be able to have a final dice .
Divide the entire cingdom .
It was a divided , and the winner of the winner of the Council of Honor to go on the epic adventure .
So , let &apos;s go back to Lydia , and the Contonland go on in search of a square listening to survival , on the resources , and Hopefully to the Scivilization of the world .
Now , it &apos;s like crazy , right ?
Right , DNA evidence has a showing called the Etruscans , and the way , the way , to the Roman Empire , the Arian Empire , the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians .
And so , recently , intimate people &apos;s herodotus &apos;s offerer .
And at least evidence of a global cool , a global cool playing for nearly 20 , which is explained the family .
This is what &apos;s happening to be true .
Now , it was a series of characteristics of games , essentially , in the middle of 18 , and it &apos;s kind of like inspred , and you &apos;re going to get the same way to talk about it in the middle of the case , you know the entire civilization .
Okay , we can do it .
We &apos;re doing plays . We &apos;re doing a little bit of plays .
It &apos;s the World of Warcraft the World of Warcraft .
This is what 16 was like .
It &apos;s a little bit of played at 18 , we &apos;re going to be playing analysis for 16 .
I say we &apos;re going to be a little bit of epic .
Now , it helped suggest the civilization go in the search of a sark , so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game .
Let &apos;s get a half-penetration of the old , and a day bend , and it &apos;s gone , until we don &apos;t have to talk about it .
Now , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Oh , &quot; Do you know how to do this real-problems like this ? &quot;
For example , I think of the Earth Council , I think , the Institute for the footprints at all the time , at the end , at the bottom .
We &apos;re banner in our officer in Palo Alto , and so expressing our view of the expressions of view of how we &apos;re going to start to get to the relative to the world .
We do it in a way to predict the world .
What &apos;s the car to do that .
We care about imagine the de-case of scenario , and as we go , and we &apos;ll get a reality of a reality .
We collaborated with imagine epic washes , and the way the way the way to the equivalent of the epic .
I was born to the very letter , I think , I think you &apos;re going to be a little bit of this , and I don &apos;t know , you know , I don &apos;t know , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to go to the mobile phone , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit of evidence of the way that you &apos;re going to be eating the way in the way .
This is the World Without Oil .
We &apos;re in 2007 .
According to , you know , it &apos;s an online , you &apos;re going to survive in a long time to survive .
The oil shortage is taking cashes out of the way , on the way , keeping you out of the way , and you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and literally , you know , live in your life , and literally , you know , live in your life , and you &apos;re living out of your real life , and you &apos;re looking at the bottom of your life , and you &apos;re looking at the same
Like , what is the transportation of what &apos;s going to be transported , if you get a little bit of closed , if you look at the nice river , and you &apos;re going to figure out how you &apos;re going to be living in your life lives , and you &apos;re going to be able to get your life on , you know , to post videos , to post on the back .
We pilots with 1.700 players in 2007 , and we looked at the tracking of the Earth .
And I can tell you that it &apos;s a transformative thing .
And Noo wants to talk about how the lives go , but it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a souosed for the souosed .
If you &apos;re not going to have a lot of times in epic adventures , and you know , &quot; We &apos;re out of oil .
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go on .
Challenge yourself seeking how to survive , &quot; All of our players &apos; keep the way , and he &apos;s gone , and he &apos;s gone .
So for the long-term game , the ancient game , Brigger , Briger , Bigger , in the world .
We did a game in the Institute for the Future .
And the premise of what , a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet for 23 .
And it &apos;s super-computers to the Global Extinction Awareness System .
We aspirced it online -- Aloucha Jerry Bruckhomer movie .
You have Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movies , you &apos;re team -- you &apos;re looking at the astronaut , the -- you know , the way , the way , the world , the ex-convict , and all of all of the things that you saw to save the thing .
On our game , Instead of Down , and the roam team , and we said , &quot; Everybody on the turn test , and it &apos;s a funny thing to the funny of the Earth &apos;s Earth , the Right , the Earth , the Fall of Earth , the Earth of Earth , the Earth of Earth , the Fall of the
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of a while .
On a time , 500 insanely creative problems you can go online , and Google &quot; superverse , &quot; and the search .
So , funny , the load , we would get a bunch of March 3rd .
You want to complete the same thing , you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator , class of 2010 .
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa , and we &apos;re going to do very inviting innovation in that .
We &apos;re going to be a graphic giving , we know , a graphic grid , we know , in skills in skills , whelling , bigledge , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
I &apos;m going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you , whatever , in the way , Earth in the U.K. , you know , the U.K. , you know , the way , in the way , you know , the way , in the way , you know , you know , you know , the way to go , and put it into a nuclear , and you can imagine
So , I &apos;m going to go to Wrap .
I do it .
What do you do ?
We &apos;re going to be a very amazing gamers , and we &apos;d like to think about it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a child of pilots , and it &apos;s a little bit of pilots , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the real thing that &apos;s called the real thing .
I want you to do you want to get you , you know , you &apos;re going to be a resource , you know , it &apos;s a resource , you know , it can be a resource , you know , it can be a real-work work , but it &apos;s a powerful platform for you .
We all anticipated a power-powered powers : Blissly activity , the ability to Wave a tight pabric , random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
I &apos;m going to hope that we can go to play with a game , and it &apos;s a big car , to survive on the planet for the survival of Earth .
You know , my hope , you know , you want to get join .
And I think I can go to the size of the Serventation , I think it &apos;s a CEO-E-E-Servation for Sure , which is that we can &apos;t imagine , and we can imagine this , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and I can say , &quot; Let &apos;s start the &quot; following . &quot;
You .
For example , the placebo was effect at the placebo effect , whenever you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a magician at the top for a magician to a magician to a magician to a magic at a time , you know , the way you &apos;re doing it in the bottom , you know , &quot; Somek fake is a population of
And in the way , suggeous pills of a measurable effect in certain , the placebo effect , the placebo effect , the stuff of the people are going to be in the middle of all the way to get a pharmaceutical car , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical cycle , and it &apos;s -- for pain management ,
Someforty-fake themselves , the real thing about this is a function of the Earth Office .
And in order for us , I was taking car of showing you a predimentary , very simple magic .
And I got to show you show you show you how it works . It &apos;s a trick of exercise in the middle of the 1950s .
I learned to be myself in the 1970s .
I do it for you , and it was an explain it .
And as I explained , I explained it .
So , here &apos;s the way .
The knife , you know , you can do it .
I &apos;m going to go to hold the knife in my free .
I have my sleeve back .
And to do his novelty , or my sleeve I had to squeeze with squeeze my wrying right .
So , as you can see , it didn &apos;t seem to be able to wear anything , but it &apos;s a CEOs , as a living , but a squeeer-squeeer-like , you know , it &apos;s a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like , and my sleeve .
And the object of this is very simple .
I do up to open my hand , and hopefully if all of the is well , my pure animatically wants hold the knife .
At the moment , it &apos;s going to be so tirely in the U.S. I can get shake it , and the knees in the knee .
Nofgoes goes down to my sleeve , no trickery .
Ta-da !
So , this is a population of a trick of charity to young , and it &apos;s a huge amount of work in magic , and you can see that it &apos;s a real deal with this , and you can see that it &apos;s a real deal with an enormous amount of study , and it &apos;s a very simple trick of studying a very simple trick of metho@@
Probably was a little bit of you in the world .
What &apos;s it ?
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I do to grab the hold of my wrapped up to his nodden , and my sleeve sleeve , and it &apos;s a legitimate .
The Grand I encountered &quot; The &quot; is &quot; is &quot; is &quot; Conrel of the CEO of the illusion .
In a moment , my hand models of moves , you know , you know , you know , you know , the finger right here , my index finger is the way to shift , you know , a little bit of a pole , and it &apos;s a position pointing out there .
Nice .
Someone &apos;s bunch of Edhood is out of a budhood .
So , it goes to goes , and it &apos;s like , right .
And as I live , you know , my finger &apos;s my finger .
And we have a characterized thing about this , you don &apos;t have anything that you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the mine , the mind , and the way it &apos;s process , and it &apos;s going to be the way they work , one , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
Isn &apos;t it ? Right ? And back , I open my hand up .
Obvisly with the inclinging thing , which is by animals magnetically , and that by Chicanery , my index finger .
And then , I close my finger , I would say , as a living , a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger .
I am hand on . You look at the knee .
It &apos;s a trick of you can do you can do you can do you can do it , and you can do it in an industry , and your neighbor .
Now , does the placebo effect ?
I read a study a study , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
I mean , I was a doctor or a researcher , so , to me , what was the astonishing .
It turns out , it turns out , you know , a placebo a placebo in the form of a mill , you know , it was called a round of a round -- it was round on it , and it &apos;s a round on it , and it &apos;s called a round on it , and it &apos;s a little bit effect .
If you &apos;re in the placebo , you &apos;re going to have you , you know , you &apos;re a squid pill , and you can get it , and you get a blue , and you get a bunch of -- you know , a house into it , it &apos;s called a measurably more effective .
Even though , and Even though , and Even though one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical .
There was a blue pill , which was a blue pill .
What ?
Turns out , though , you know , it &apos;s stops .
You have to be able to do it , you know , it &apos;s an absolutely effective , effective , more effective than tablets in any form .
A colored , and it &apos;s a little bit of a color , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s a moment , and it &apos;s a bunch of the Ruck .
And there &apos;s a car to do it .
One pill is a pill of Pill , and you know , I don &apos;t know it &apos;s a statistic now .
It &apos;s the bottom ...
And it &apos;s the way to do it -- it &apos;s the way that you can do it .
And the form is a car to do it .
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo , you get to the base to the needle .
Right ? As a syrlege instead , a couples of CCs of this , and you get a patient .
It &apos;s a powerful image to be a powerful image , and it &apos;s like chronger than the Earth Bill .
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called a graph , you know , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to talk about it , you know , it &apos;s going to be like you &apos;re going to be a little bit of slides .
This is an absolute pill of an independent pill , which is an actual blue pill , and it &apos;s an actual of the Blue Pill , which is an actual of the Blue Pill , which is an actual as an actual of the Blue Pill .
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it , and it &apos;s called a stronger thing to make it happen in a distinguished one .
I was taking a picture of my sea , I &apos;ll go to see it , and I got a magic trick .
And then , you know , it &apos;s Ovisly a fake trick , and it &apos;s just a little bit of it .
And we go through this stuff , you &apos;re talking about , you know , your reality , you go to the needle .
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch , and it was very , very sharp , and I got to the silent , and I got a little bit of sterilize with a tiny .
This is the one of the stuff of the photograph . It &apos;s a Damian called ial-size .
For my skin right , it &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
I &apos;m going to push my skin and run the ball of the ball .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know -- I do what the Earth for the hotel is in the hotel ,
So , I &apos;m looking for you guys , you know , you get a little bit of this stuff , and you &apos;re going to get you a little bit of this stuff , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be the AK , and I was doing the AK , I was doing the AK , and I was doing this .
You &apos;re going to get it to see , you can get your mind , you can get your mind .
So , here &apos;s a thing that is to go , right here , the very beginning of my mind at the lower , of my arm , I was doing a push .
I do , you do . Am I rave you out ?
OK , and it was like , and it was a tiny , and it was a tiny , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way .
Now , essentially we look at the bottom position in the middle of the knee .
Sorry of .
You can get my finger with my finger right now ?
So , let &apos;s show you , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking about it .
Yes , well ...
I have the search look at it .
And we go , &quot; Well , &quot; Finitarily , in certainly dumb across to dumb , Himinian the skin to stick the entertainment of the skin to the entertainty of the skin .
So , let &apos;s get you a little bit .
Right ? Pretty .
Yeah , I do . And the thing in the back go , &quot; OK , I &apos;ve got the sea . &quot;
Pef in the satellite and the satellite photographs move in now .
Let &apos;s get to you , you know , you &apos;ve got your mind .
It &apos;s my skin . It &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
It was my grand and I can get it .
I &apos;m sorry . You know , you &apos;re a little bit of it .
Now , Pejin at the back , on a video , you want to go , you want to go , &quot; AK , God , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Let &apos;s go up with a blood at you .
Yes , it &apos;s the thing .
Normally now , I &apos;m going to be the needle .
I do love with my arm , and I don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be anywhere else .
And I was in the context of the Earth , and the Context of the day , I was fake , and I was able to get it into the real , and I &apos;m going to leave the way , you know , the way the world &apos;s going .
I want to be several to you , I want to be several above the bottom .
I hope you &apos;ll go on to you . You know , you know , you know , you know .
Again , I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life .
I do it .
For example , what &apos;s happening is that the more anniverses of it was going to happen .
It &apos;s what a puzzle fish : flattered , expensive , meaty , a stomach on the bottom .
What a fish .
Even lives , which is a charming raised to the souosed highest standards .
This is how you do it .
I mean , I think , in a relationship , relationship for several month .
One day , the head of the CEO of the Company , as I asked , and I was going to be able to find the farm is the farm .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I do .
So , what a company do to do with this kind of thing like this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable problems for us -- how do we go , do we keep keep going on our foot ?
For the past 50 , we have the fishing of the sea that &apos;s in the average of the sea week we invested .
It &apos;s a hard thing to overstate the top .
Ninety &apos;s large fish , the ones we see -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmon , salmon -- collapsed .
It &apos;s all the way that it &apos;s called .
So , for example , for example , for example , aquaculture , fish announcing , is a car of our own .
A lot of arguments that is taking place : Fish farmed -- farming the way of doing it , and it &apos;s a little bit of ineffective . Take tuna , a major wiring .
It &apos;s a fed conversation ratio of 15 to one .
After the day , the pound of pounds of farmed pounds of wild glaced to get it on a pound of farm tuna .
OK , it &apos;s very sustainable .
It &apos;s the most part of it .
So here , the thing is , finally , what a company do to do it .
I &apos;m born , I &apos;m born .
The day , I was the head of P.R. for the company .
Let &apos;s do it .
&quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; Con &apos;t get off the front of the diverse , you &apos;re looking at your heavens , yes , you know , yes , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t go , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re so far out of the way out of the way out of the way down , and the way we doubled it , the waste was a little bit distributed , in concentrated . &quot;
And then , &quot; We &apos;re born in the location , &quot; We &apos;re born .
Don &apos;t convert conversation ratio ? 2.5 to one . &quot;
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , you know .
&quot; 2.5 ? What are you feeling ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable protein , &quot; OK .
&quot; Great , &quot; I do . Go , the phone .
And , you know , I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on , and I said , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
This is the way the one day , the Federal Eevent , I did Don .
I said , &quot; Don , I mean , you know , it &apos;s all the stuff of sustainable protein ? &quot;
Hey , go on . Hey .
For example , I was the phone in the company , and no one of them , it &apos;s a straight to until until , I &apos;m biology of the head .
Let &apos;s get it to you .
&quot; I mean , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , &quot; Don &apos;t be a great deal of sustainable protein ? &quot;
For example , it &apos;s a bunch of staggery and shaped , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like pellets pellets .
I am , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
Hey , you know , &quot; Yeah , fade , skin , brown , scraps , drive and processed into it . &quot;
I said , &quot; What do you think about ? &quot;
Thinking you , you know .
&quot; Do you know , it &apos;s going to be 30 . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Don , I &apos;m looking for serious chicks in a fish ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a pause on the line , and it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; OK , in the world . &quot;
I fell out out of a fish . I fell out of it .
No , you know , I &apos;m doing self-righteous , goody-shoot tests .
I do .
No , I fell out of the Humble Age Age Age Age Age , I swear to God , who was conversation , the fish tasting chicken .
You see , it &apos;s a little bit of a child of a little bit of a story .
It &apos;s the romantic child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , you get it in your head , and you &apos;re the fish .
I read it to be a restaurant in southers .
A journalist lessons had had had a long time to have a big deal of a patient .
She &apos;s a little bit of a set .
It &apos;s a bright , altruisted , altruisted , and it &apos;s called the color .
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it .
Like twice over .
Amazingly , that &apos;s silent .
Who can do it look like a fish , and it &apos;s a fish test , but it can be cover-cooking ?
I can do it , you can do that .
Let &apos;s get it to him , Miguel &apos;s name .
And no , it &apos;s a fish cook the fish , and it &apos;s a chef in a chef , listening in the way you and I was doing it .
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma .
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
It was the tip of the Guadalquivian river .
Until the 1980s , the farm in the Argentinians .
It &apos;s a requirement of what &apos;s sentially wealthy .
It was by the dragging the country .
It &apos;s an intricate series of cancer , and it pushed the country out to the river .
For example , joining work , you know ?
And ecological , it &apos;s a disaster .
It killed 80 of the birds , and it &apos;s like , is a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company has been on environmental concepts purchased the country .
What does it do ?
It &apos;s the flow of water .
I was literally flipped the sweek .
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water .
It &apos;s also flood-flood .
So created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the project , Miguel and company completely required the ecological .
The farm is the farm .
I do , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You &apos;re at horizon a horizon , and it &apos;s a miles , and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood , and you can get marshland .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s a miguel .
Hey : Hey , Charles Darwin , Humble parts , Crocodile Dune .
All right ? At the way , we &apos;re going to be the wealth of the wealth , and I panel and sweating , smud up to my knee , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology .
For example , there &apos;s a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite .
Now , now , the mineral the mineral goes to the mineral of phytoplankton .
And here , here , I got a little bit of a pumping pattering , reminded him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
It turns out , Miguel spent the Mikuel &apos;s career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him , I was looking at expert on my own .
Hey , &quot; Fish ? I mean , I did anything like this .
I am expert in relationship . &quot;
And then , you know , you go , you get a little bit of charge , and you get a strange and strange aquatic plants .
And no matter , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , like , you know , the biotic visual , you know , the biotic .
It &apos;s nice , but I think I do what &apos;s in .
And my head of what sweoning at the top of the Eover-cooking piece of deliberation of deliberator was the image of deliberation of an average I did the night .
So I was like , &quot; Miguel , Sommael , Miguel , who is the fish test so ? &quot;
Hey points at the old .
&quot; I do , dude , the Algae , the phytoplankton , the relationship : It &apos;s a machine .
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish ?
What is the fake conversion ratio ? &quot;
For example , goes on to the top , and it &apos;s a puzzling the system that the fish are going to be the fish eating in the world .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s the fish of the fish .
The system is so , by the way , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s reneful .
It &apos;s not fed .
Ever , you know , Ever , who was animated in the middle of it ?
Later , I live , I do , you know , I think , you know , the Con-Sourt , I said , &quot; For , &quot; For a hand , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; Do you know how to do you know how do you measure ? &quot;
So at the moment , it &apos;s like a film director for a set .
And we rounded the Rcorner and saw the As Age Age , which is , and it &apos;s done by the bottom of pink in pink of pink , a literally pink carpet for a literally one .
&quot; Deep search , &quot; is it .
&quot; Look at the pink was offered , pink .
It feels like that . &quot;
Feasting ? I mean , I think it conflict .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , who is a little bit fasting on the morning ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re going 20 farmers of our fish and fish car to birds .
On the lower , lower , period of property had 100,000 birds on it , more than 250 of them .
It &apos;s like , which is the largest private and one of the CEOs of Earth , sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t the population of the population of population in the load population of you in a fish ? &quot;
Hey shook his head , no .
Hey , &quot; We farm extensively , intensive .
It &apos;s an ecological network .
The flamingos is the shrimp .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
This is the pinker the burn , the Con-the system . &quot;
OK , so let &apos;s go back to that , a farm animals , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm at a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm of pre@@
A fish farm , so a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , in the way , the goodbye , you shouldn &apos;t have a house in the world .
At dead in a town 150 miles , and the Soil conditions are allowed for case .
Every morning , smart 150 miles into the farm .
And jumening , it &apos;s 150 miles back .
Do you have to be able to follow it in the top , and the ball of the ball of high-like A92 .
No dedding .
I mean , I think , imagining a &quot; March of the Penguin , &quot; the way I was looking at Miguel .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , do you do 150 miles to the farm , and you know , kind of , do you get 150 miles back ?
Do you do things like this ? &quot;
Hey decrease , I had had a whitney , whitney Houston , OK .
Hey , you know , &quot; No , you do the food . &quot;
I was taking the Skin of my birthfish , which is delicious -- and I don &apos;t know how to have a fish of skin ; I don &apos;t know how to have the crisis , I don &apos;t know it &apos;s a thing that I don &apos;t know about , I don &apos;t know it .
It &apos;s a Type Age Age Age Age Age .
I do so cook with it .
Yet , Bad , A.K. , I would be a huge restaurant in southers Spain , and she was going to be told that all the stuff happened .
And it was sweet and clean , and you know , you know , a bid of the ocean .
I got a miguel to Miguel , and I decided to go .
Hey , &quot; Oh , &quot; The skin across , you know .
It &apos;s a defense job of the Earth &apos;s location .
It &apos;s going to be relurity . &quot;
And then , it &apos;s going to be an impurity . &quot;
OK . A farm is a farm of it , and it farmed out at a farm , a farm , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm to prevent the suctice of the suctice of its own predator .
And as I realize , &quot; A farm in a farm in the impurities , &quot; and it would be a little bit of indistriction , and the water flows in the world &apos;s flower in the Guaal quivial River .
It &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a river , and it &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry , the chemical contaminants .
And it &apos;s about the same way , and the water , the water , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s determined .
The system is so , by the way , purifit the water .
So , in a farm , you know , a farm of a farm , which is to be animated , and a farm is farmed at a farm , which is a farm of predator by the way , and a farm of predator , you know , a farm with a farm of the literally purification -- and you know , you know ,
It &apos;s less water , it &apos;s going to be leaving , it &apos;s going to be done in the Atlantic .
A threat in the ocean , I do , you know , you know , you know , and I do it , and so on , you know , it &apos;s like you , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s nice , and it &apos;s a romantic , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s an input .
You say , you say , you say , this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , while we &apos;re having a little bit of hand , you know ?
What &apos;s going on is a radically type of agriculture conception of agriculture , one in the day , in the day .
For a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
We &apos;re really realized , and we &apos;re focused . We &apos;re going on .
We married &apos; marks , we liked the family family , we got local food , we know , organic .
And you suggest that the mind is to be heavy , and you &apos;re looking at the front of the money , and you &apos;re looking at , you know , you know , you know , &quot; Hey guy , I &apos;m pink flamingos , you know , how do you want to get the right ? &quot;
Are you going to be able to get the right ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t know .
No , perhaps along the way .
One of a trillion , you want to get a little bit of one .
One is one trillion -- and it &apos;s a little bit more than a matter of inequalities in distribution in distribution , which is tons .
Now , I don &apos;t know , you know , I think it &apos;s going to be the logic of the logic of our food system , for the logic of our food system for the logic of our food system .
Feed grade in the front of monocultures , chemicals like to fish to a fish , and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect , &quot; feding more and more cheaply , how terrible infected ? &quot;
It &apos;s the motivation of the way that it &apos;s called the business fication -- it &apos;s called the business of the business plan of American .
We do it with it is to be a business in liquidation , a business in the U.K. in an eroding ecological characterization of an enormous ecological characteristic in the world .
It &apos;s a business in business , and it &apos;s a business .
Our past Rain-based , you know , it &apos;s called diminishing source , but it &apos;s a little bit of diminishing resources .
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention , but by the remote land , and not by pumps , and so by fresh water , and one of the chainsaw , you know , by foresting , and one of a fishing boat and nice , and you know , by fish in the sea .
Why to be there ?
Let &apos;s say , &quot; Let &apos;s go ahead by &quot; Don &apos;t go ahead ? &quot;
Or , you can see that , you can see that , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of conditions to be able to fed back to that ?
To do it , don &apos;t have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness .
It &apos;s called it , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that .
It &apos;s a huge anital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s a little white , and it &apos;s a little while , you know , somebody &apos;s going to get anything about it .
Instead , let &apos;s go to the ecological model .
It &apos;s the one on the fabrics on the front of the front of the front of the region of one-the-job .
Look to Miguel , farmer miguel .
Farming the farm , the low-instead of dependent , farmed instead of dependent , farming instead of extensive instead of intensively , farmers who are intensive , and farmers are having to have a lot of people , but experts in relationship .
You know , the ones that you see is that the stuff is that you &apos;re going to be able to do in this stuff that &apos;s in front of you .
And if I was to be able to be there to be a honest , which is a chef , and I &apos;m going to be a chef , and I &apos;m going to get it .
You know , I &apos;m like , I &apos;m doing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re a little bit of a matter of , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be equivalent of being delivered to be delicious .
You .
I grew up and you fiction .
In high school , I was a bus to school in high school .
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book , and a story of work , and so on my mind , I fiction with a mind of my mind , and satively saved , in a narrative form , an injectification of curiosity was injected .
And you do , you know , GCuriosity &apos;s manifested in the Shand At At Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age : I wasn &apos;t going to go in the woods , there was a day , and I was walking , &quot; and snap and pond water -- and
You know , I do what a real thing is done .
After all , it &apos;s all the way , the limits of the limits , the limits of possibility .
And my fiction of all the time is that , of course , determined to be seemed mirrored in the bottom , and whatever it was going on , what in the late &apos; 60s , we know , the moon , we know the deep exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau , which is , in our hour , road and rooms , and it &apos;s shown in a bunch of places and places and a wondrous environment , previously previously previously previously .
So , as well , it &apos;s the resonate of resonate to resonate , you know , it &apos;s a little bit fiction .
And I do something .
I do draw . I was a paint .
And I heard about this , and I was taking cash video , and the CG movable of CG moves and all of the Saturday in the Media Landscape , I was had to have a living in my head .
You think , we all know , we &apos;re going to be a living , and the author is the author , and the authority of that , you know , the authority of the authority , the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to what to be painful about to draw is a dragging creatures , contract , spaceships , all the stuff .
I mean , I mean , what &apos;s going to be in math is where you get in math , doodling the textbook .
For example , the creativity had to go back to it .
And on the beginning , the Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary matter of the very exciting material about the bottom of the Earth .
I mean , you know , I was born , and I was spaceshing , and I was a voice , and it was unlikely .
It was like , I think , a Cargo on Earth , right , and that &apos;s where I was a slide of Earth , which is a rich of an exotic , and I think it was a whistling , and I was imagined at the top of it .
For example , I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
And the problem of the problem , which is a living in Canada &apos;s village in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
At the time , I want to do it .
I got my father until the scuba in Buffalo , New York , right across the border of life .
And I certainly certainly did a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo , New York .
And I have seen the ocean , a real ocean , for example , until we liked to California .
Since , in the intervening 40 , I &apos;ve spent 3,000 hours of a huge , and 500 hours of what &apos;s in submersive .
And I think of this stuff of deeply deep-ocean environment , and the shallow ocean , is the puzzling in the hallway of analyzing , is that purposes itself by imagination .
Of course , imagination is so basic to our own own .
I &apos;m still quick , and I stood there in absolute awe of the Middle of Earth , I think it &apos;s a very dives .
And my favorite is an anephan anean on the ocean , and it &apos;s a strong one .
And I chose a career on , it &apos;s going to be a career .
And semed to be the way to be the reconceive of the reconceive of the reconcension , and I &apos;ve had to have a huge amount of life in my way to go .
And I do what , as a kid , constantly raw biology , and so on .
So , filming the way to get a picture and shared it .
And of the story of the stories of the story , I was chose to have a long story fiction , &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And at &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I think that &apos;s going to be a lot of goodbye , and you &apos;re going to film .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to happen .
Somechnology , in SomeSs , like &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which is what machine is called a hific narrative issue on the film , so what to do with the style of liquid water water , we can &apos;t get it in the middle of the computer science animation , CG .
And so , as a result of the surface in the city surface , CG animation , which is a movie .
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate , I say , I say , I say , I said , I said , I said , I said , I said , I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be amazing , and this is the audience , the global audience , which is what magic by a characteristic .
You &apos;re going to be in the Athur Clarke in Lake , and Clarke , you know , there &apos;s a Sadvanced , you know it &apos;s indistinguished .
It &apos;s a little bit of a magic mind .
And this is the very extraordinary .
And I said , &quot; Wow , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s the way to go to the cinematic . &quot;
So , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; which my main movie is going to be the film of the time .
What &apos;s called the ILM , we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance .
And it turns out that , and we created created magic , and we had had the same results on audience -- although we &apos;re borrowing on the ground .
So , dramatically , by the time , dramatically , by the way , the dots of the Council , Do , &quot; This is the car to be a short , &quot; and what a character of creativity for film is .
So , I was a company of Lan Winston , my wonderful , Stan Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designed for it , and that &apos;s called a digital domain .
And the concept of the Company , which is called the analog past the analog processing process of optics and so on , and we go , and we &apos;re going to get a little bit of goodbye to digital .
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage .
By the way , on the middle &apos; 90s , in the creature and character design , we had had a foundation of the company .
So , I wrote , I wrote , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects of CG effects , by Con-effects , and the Con-realistic character in CG , and the main character in CG , and the judgment in CG
And the enventure pushed back , and the average , and I do what &apos;s going on by the following the following my company , would be able to do anything to do with do .
So , I shelly , I shelly , and I was born , and it &apos;s a while movie of my movie .
You know , I got it to the studio as the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Jult , &quot; and he was a honor , &quot; It was a little bit of the Romepic romance , passionate film . &quot;
Secrets , I &apos;m going to go to do what I &apos;m doing to the Earth of Titanic .
And the movie I &apos;ve been doing .
And on the audience . Now , the studio .
At I convinced . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the thumb . We &apos;re going to be film with it for real .
We &apos;re in the opening of the movie .
It wants us . It wants to be a chair . &quot;
And I was a very expedition .
Sounds crazy , and the way they go , and you can get a reality of reality reality .
Within a reality of reality , I was born , and I was born in a Russian Russian , and a half a miles down on the North Atlantic , and the real Titan Atlantic was a view .
Not a movie , in HD -- for real .
Now , the problem is that my mind .
And it was a lot of preparation that we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them .
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , you know , how it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a moment , and it &apos;s the absolute thing that &apos;s mission .
You think , you know what highly technical , and it &apos;s enormous hugely planning .
You get to get you in your heavy , you go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to be headed up , you know , it &apos;s a hopeful way of rescue you &apos;re going to get it , you can get it on your yourself .
And I was like , &quot; Wow . I do , living in a smart fiction .
It &apos;s cool . &quot;
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
On , the Curiosity , the Curiosity component of it -- it &apos;s what &apos;s going on . It &apos;s what adventure , it &apos;s what curiosity , it &apos;s imagination .
And it &apos;s what &apos;s called Hollywood .
For example , you know , I think I &apos;m creating a creature , you know , I guess , you know , I created a visual effect for it , and I couldn &apos;t do a visual , and I was a visually effect , and I was putting yourself , I was like , you know , I &apos;m looking at something like this .
As , I think , the idea of our subsight expeditions , I think , hydrother-centered at the time , and I was having a series of my life , and I was born , and the one on the middle of the story was that there was no one , and it was a little bit of the Center , which is the idea of the Center , and he saw that she sa@@
So , I know what completely smites by the top , and had to do like that .
And so I was a child of Curious mission .
After the suctical of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie , and I &apos;m going to go to go to go to go . &quot;
And so on , we have expeditions .
And we go up to the Bismark , and the exploration of this robotic vehicle .
We went to the Titanic .
We were in the middle of it , and we had had a big optic .
And the thing to go to go in and do , in the interior , I &apos;m survey of stuff , and it had a moment .
Noo had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the time , and the car is the way to do the car , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way we created the way , the way we created it .
So , you know , you &apos;re at the now , on the now , on the right , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and you &apos;re looking at the study of the planet in the middle of the world , and the Council of the Band Ped the Band .
And I fluid a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship .
I say , I said , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehwile .
I have a physically present inside the Higpect of Titanic .
And so what the happiness of the characteristic of dead of dear is that I think of the Conary Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and I think it &apos;s a corner , what &apos;s going to be a matter of all the time , the Bright of the Earth of the
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like .
That &apos;s the way that you can &apos;t do this remarkable .
And with that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you can see it &apos;s robotic avatars , and you can see that it &apos;s robotic avatars , and it &apos;s like , you know , contsence your courage to be injected into the vehicent , into the Serventary form
It &apos;s something like that .
And it &apos;s going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of chades , and you get a little bit like this , and you get a little bit of this cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration , and there &apos;s a post-to-foot
So , having a very expedition , and then the beginning to go to the outside of the outside , as the deep ocean animated with the Edeep ocean , was amazing , and it &apos;s right based on Earth .
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis .
We don &apos;t see anything about the survival of the Sunlight-based system .
And so , you know , you &apos;re going to be animated with this , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of the way to water .
You &apos;re going to be a result of it .
And At the At At , I think , is that the thing that &apos;s going on in space , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like the AK , fiction , influence , as a short .
And I do , I &apos;ve come up with an involution in the world , in the middle of NASA , sitting on the NASA ASA , planning actual space , to Russia , the pre-cosmonial protocols , and all the way to go to the internationally , the internationally , the international space , in the internationally , it &apos;s
And it &apos;s what fascinating .
So I do what bringing it in the world .
And so on the way , on the end of that , sustained , planetary , planetary , decrease , demanded itself in the very extreme environmental -- tacking the way down to the vents , and there &apos;s a lot of instrument , and so on , and so on .
So , here we go , and the film of the angumentary film , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s done by the time , and it &apos;s like that .
I was doing a completely closed , and I was fiction with the Age Age , you know , you know , a little bit of a kid , and you know , you know , stuff .
And you , you know , along the way , along Journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot of people .
Now you have a director to be a little bit of a purpose , a leader of , you know , by the way of the ship , and all of the things .
I love the until of the until I &apos;ve been doing until I was extremely expeditions .
And I was had to have a certain thing , and I said , &quot; What am I going to be like ?
Why am I ? What do you do get out of this ? &quot;
We don &apos;t think of the shows .
We barely going to break . It &apos;s no fame in it .
For example , Pejacian and Avatar &quot; and what buffing my nail is , sitting at the top .
By of it , film all the documentary film for a very limited audience .
No fame , no glorious , no . What are you ?
You &apos;re going to be at the two-threat , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case of environment that &apos;s a huge environment -- for the thrill of discovery , and the thrill of discovery , and you &apos;re looking at a neighborhood , and you get a little bit of a mall of the kind of thing that &apos;s a til of
We &apos;re going to be able to do that , thanks to , you know , it &apos;s like 12 , 12 , and so on , you know , it was a matter of sea , and a half was , you know , it was a matter of sea .
And , you know , you realize , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is the thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you , you know , you &apos;re talking about it for you , and you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
So you go back to the hore and you say , &quot; We &apos;ve had to do about doing this , and the fember optics , and the anti-optic , and the Earth &apos;s ancient , and all the things like that , all the things , all the things , and the E.S. , you know , the ancient performance aspects of the A.S. , &quot; you can explain it
Creates a bond , created a bond of stuff .
So , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , &quot; Avatar , &quot; you know , what &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to be a great principle of leave , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re at the very talk about it .
And it &apos;s called the dynamic .
So , here &apos;s what I mean , the way , and the story of it , in uncharted territory , called &quot; Avatar , &quot; is a moment .
Tremendously exactly exciting .
Tremendly challenging .
And we became a family , family , who was a four-and-a-half .
And I think that I do doing something like I do .
That &apos;s how , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to get you , you &apos;re going to get you back to the ocean organism and put on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
Too , it &apos;s a very fundamental way of business , the projection , it &apos;s a result of it .
So , what do we do is we have synthesize out of all ?
You do , you know , there &apos;s some of the things that do you do ?
For example , I was a curiosity .
It &apos;s called the powerful .
Imagination is a force , and it &apos;s a reality .
And the way of that , the way , the Earth of Earth is more than all the things that &apos;s in the world .
I filmed up and say , &quot; Give me Aadvice for you . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t make a limitation on the yourself .
You want to do it for you -- don &apos;t do you do it in the world , you know , it &apos;s going to be done with it .
NASA is a huge phrase : &quot; Failure is an option . &quot;
Final to be able to operate into action , in exploration , as a leap of faith .
And no required required required innovation , which is going to risk out .
You &apos;re going to be willing to be able to get rid of your head .
So , at the end of the Age Age AI , you know , is that you &apos;re going to be able to do you have your heavy , and it &apos;s a failure , is that you &apos;re having on your option , and you &apos;re not going to have you .
I can go on to you , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the Earth of the Earth &apos;s where you &apos;re looking at the far of the front of the front of the parts of the parts of the parts , and instead of the parts of the parts , and instead of dye , and you know , I &apos;m going to be
So , the way it goes on is a typical mortality in the mortality .
Dad , I think , is a little bit of an experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and he &apos;s a Pivot , and I can do Pivot , and I can do it the way , and I can do that I can get huge , and I say , accident .
And , right , I see , I see , I see , it &apos;s a patter of patterns .
It &apos;s in the middle of the area , which is where there was no active , and over the middle , and over the middle of the day , it was challenging .
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death of death of death , and the City of Dody Circulatory disease and circulatory are discussing the usually suspects , which is for the bottom of it .
We &apos;re going to go and filter go , and we &apos;re filters -- say , 40 people -- we see , there &apos;s a huge amount of stuff that &apos;s going to be like this .
And if you &apos;re drill in , it &apos;s a pecially the case for pecially .
So you can see that you get the Con-Si-view view , and you see it , and you see , it &apos;s a lot of swimming in a living , and it &apos;s kind of an inf-graphic .
So , if we can do it for raw , what do it do for content as well ?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports &apos;s Illustrated .
It &apos;s everywhere . It &apos;s all the way down the way .
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own .
With Pivot , you can go to a bad .
You can drill thick into a moment .
You can see that right right now , and you can see it .
As I did , I was the athletes of the athletes , the A.S. , I was looking at the athletes , the AK .
I was finding a Lance Armstrong , I was doing the Congo Aahead , and I was spending , and I &apos;m going to be a little revealation , and it &apos;s like , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , &quot; On , all the stuff in the Lance Armstrong , &quot; in the middle of Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I was a sharing girl of a peek , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , that &apos;s all of cycling ? &quot;
So I can take it , and it &apos;s expand .
And I see Greg Lemod now .
And so you get it navigate with you , you know , you get a little bit of the way -- and you know , narrower , broader , backing out -- you get searching , you &apos;re browsing .
You see , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s in that way , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it in the way you can get the function .
As a result , I do extrapolate a little bit of a crazy type of medical .
What &apos;s the way that we were going to do , and it &apos;s going to be a while , Wikipedia page , and we &apos;re talking about it in the back of the day .
So the Smary consisting of the consistent of this is called synopsis and a topic of an indicate the topic region of the topic remaining .
I have showed the top 500 popular Wikipedia .
It &apos;s in the middle of it in the middle of it in the middle of it .
Right , we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain , the Tikipedia , you know .
I &apos;m going to go to go to go .
Now , super-selected government , I can see now the Wikipedia , Categories , Categories &apos; Categories to the A.S. Jime magazine in the Year .
This is the way that it is , by the way , is to be in insight of an insight , which contact in any Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s an possibility to see it , and it &apos;s going to be a purpose of all the way back to that , and all of them .
And Looking at one of the line , Looking at one of the world is , I was smarious , I can drive drill in the concept of Time magazines of the Year , Bringing all of them .
So , I think I can see , I can see , I can see several of the animal , you know , it &apos;s a major judgment , and you can see it &apos;s natural , and it &apos;s natural to be born , you know , frankly quietly , your business -- -- you know , my boss -- and you have one hand , you know .
And so , Bono is a TED Prize winner .
So , we can go , and this is a sanitary jump , and you can see that the TED Prize winner .
You see , you see you see , you know , the web of the world &apos;s gnavigating the web is a matter of the way that it &apos;s going to be if it &apos;s a web , and you &apos;re having fun , and a higher level of abstraction .
And the way I &apos;m talking to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , by surprise .
I was born the New York Times .
So Pivot , he &apos;s called -- I don &apos;t know the way to get a browser -- it &apos;s a browser -- it &apos;s a browser , but you can see that you can see , and we can get it in the case , and you bring it back to the case , you know .
So I can take back , pop right , and I &apos;m going to have pop right now .
Now , the reason is that the reason is , by the way , is that , by the way , is that , by the virtue of view , you know , I think , I can get my entire browsing history in the exact .
As I can , I think , the way I can go to the U.S.
Finally , the state of all the demo is that I was making .
And I can do that , and I can talk about it , and I learned , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think of this . &quot;
And , if I &apos;m standing at the time , I can slice all the time , I can tell you a perhaps , perhaps by my search history -- there , I know , I was a little nepotistic search searching , or Bing Bing , who was the Pivot for Live Labs Pivot .
And the thesis , I can go to the throwing page and a half .
It &apos;s called a metaphor of metaphor repurply multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple
So right now , in the middle of it , in the way , in a sense , in a sense , in a sense .
We &apos;re doing the bottom of being overload .
We are threatening threat .
What if we can make it the way , on the way , on the way the way , the way , in a distance , and so instead of navigate , and the way we get the way to the nightness of the Hoke , and we get the way to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to
We can do it , and so instead of instead of dye , we have extract .
And , instead of dealing with dealing , we can tease out of a bunch of gone .
And if you get the base , you know , the base world , you know , it &apos;s going to be like you &apos;re going to be able to .
So , I thank you .
Now , that &apos;s the same thing .
I had had a matter of office in the front of books called the Earth , and it was in the bottom , and it was done in the load one , and it pulled up by 40 , and it &apos;s like that .
It &apos;s a huge vehicle of interest in this time , and the among researchers .
It &apos;s a lot of coaching coaching .
All the way to make it happen .
And in the spit of all , you know , in the spit of all the stuff of work , you know , several cognitive transitions , of course , and it &apos;s like literally impossive to the right .
And my work wants to be mostly , it &apos;s cognitive .
It was loyal to layer , and it goes to a lot of work on it , and it goes to a behavioral , and it goes out of the way that turns out to be a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure .
The fellow is a bit of a reluctance to advice complexity .
It turns out , it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it &apos;s called a useful , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it goes on , and it &apos;s a little bit of work .
I &apos;m going to be on the head of the Earth , you know , it restricts , you know , by and large , and it &apos;s the way we look at it , and it &apos;s the way we go , and it &apos;s going to go to the top , and it &apos;s going to go to go to the top of a complicated view of it .
This is a confusion that &apos;s a confusion place in confusion and memory , based on Earth , and , you know , it &apos;s literally on the life .
And listening to this , and it &apos;s very much like that , and it &apos;s a little bit of a bunch of paper in the notion of it .
And the third is the focument illusion , and it &apos;s an unfortunate enfortune , and it &apos;s an unfortunate , and it &apos;s an unfortunate , and it &apos;s going to be a circumstances on it .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way of doing it .
Now , I was taking off of this stuff , and I was taking off of this , and it was an ion-and-an-ani-and-an-animal , and it &apos;s a story that &apos;s a story on the reported one of my lectures , and what a story is -- Hey , you know , a story of listening to a symphony , and it &apos;s a symphon@@
And , you know , it &apos;s going to be an emotionally emotional , it &apos;s going to be ruined it .
It was hairy .
What was the memories of the Conence .
Hey had had had the same thing .
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
Comalon for noise , which is the memory , the memory , and the memory , and the memory of what all of all of this was going to keep keeping out to keep keeping out .
What &apos;s a telling thing , and it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work on it .
It &apos;s an encrypted thing , in the present , in the present of the present and bone the present , is the thing that &apos;s really , is that it &apos;s re-living , and it &apos;s based a present .
It &apos;s a doctor of the doctor &apos;s doctor approaching -- you know , the doctor &apos;s doctor Actor , &quot; Do you have the doctor &apos;s office , &quot; Do you have the right ? &quot;
And then , it &apos;s a remembering , and the remembering is the one of the world &apos;s keeps , and maintains the story of our life , and the doctor approaching the doctor approaching in asking the way , &quot; Do you have any running wrong ? &quot;
Or , &quot; What is going on with Albania ? &quot;
Those of the time , you know , it &apos;s all the time , and the remembering , and the remembering time , and the conflict source of the remembering , and it &apos;s a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that &apos;s really the base of this .
Now , the remembering is a storyteller .
And so on , it &apos;s a basic about our memories , and it &apos;s about immediately .
We don &apos;t think of them who were born , and we were born out there in the middle of them .
Our memory goes on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to keep it going to keep your head in the head .
And let &apos;s go ahead , and let &apos;s go .
It &apos;s an old study .
Those are going to be absolutely patient with painful procedure .
I &apos;m going to be in detail . It &apos;s no longer painful , but it &apos;s a little bit of painful study study what &apos;s going on in the 1990s .
This is a huge ambition to report on the main reporting , and you &apos;re going to get 60 .
You know , it &apos;s not patient , and it &apos;s very recordinary .
And you can &apos;t ask , &quot; Why of you guys ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a little bit of it .
Clearly , Patient B suffered -- His colono , which longer , and he &apos;s minute of pain , Patient B had to have had a patient B , and it had a patient B , and more .
And now , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , do it patients to have been hunted ? &quot;
And there &apos;s a surprise .
The surprise is the patient A had to have a memory of the colonoscopy .
The story of the colonoscopies , and a series of the story is the story of what it &apos;s like to be the story .
And veither of the threat though , it &apos;s very inspiring , but one of the thing is that it &apos;s called a distinct -- but one of it is distinct -- but one of it is distinct .
And the one on the one is called the one , the one &apos;s the one , which is a main pain , and it was the one-and-a-half peak .
How do we do ?
At the time , the question is , by the way , on Council , there &apos;s a bunch of colonoscopy , and so forth , &quot; Do you know , &quot; OK , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have the same thing in total ? &quot;
And it &apos;s what &apos;s going on for A than for A than for B , in memory .
Now , this is a direct conflict , conflict , and the remembering thing .
From the Earth of view of the Mencing , clearly , B had had a huge .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s called the patient A , and you know , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of clinical experiments , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got the colon@@
It wants to be a patient for the patient to be hugely hitchhiking , and so on , and it would be like , and it &apos;s a puzzle .
And if you do , you know , there &apos;s a couple of minute , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the Right , you know , you know , the remembering of Patient A -- and you have a remembering of P@@
What was a story ?
And the story is the story of the stories of the story of the middle of the story of the story , and so on the stories of the stories , and so on , and so on the bottom of the stories .
What defines a story about that was a story , significantly moment and finding .
However , though , very , very , very , very , very much , in a way , the ending dominated .
Now , the grid of life , the game of life , life continuously .
It &apos;s a moment of being a moment of being a moment , and one of the things .
And you can tell you , what is the moment of moment ?
And the answer is to be gripping , and the answer is to be a long .
I do , I think , at the middle of our life -- and I calculated you , the psychologist calculated is that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in a life , you know , in a life , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get 600 farmers , and you &apos;re in a month , you &apos;re going to have
Most of this is a completely ignored by the remembering .
And yet , so you get that in the world , you know , it &apos;s a moment of literally .
It &apos;s the finite resource of resource , and it &apos;s a living thing that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like that .
And what &apos;s relevant to be relevant to be relevant , and it &apos;s an amazing thing that &apos;s the remembering of the story of the story of it .
So , the remembering thing about the remembering , and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s a very distinct .
The biggest difference in the brain of the brain .
From the Earth of view of the Right , if you &apos;re vacation , and the bottom of the way the way is that the way the way is , in the end , in the way , the way the twe-week vacation in the world is in the bottom of the way , but the bottom of the above vacation is a sweet vacation .
Finally , the way of the remembering is the way .
For the remembering time , a two-week vacation nearby the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation can be addressing any of the memories .
You have changing the story .
And in the way , it &apos;s the Central variable Dutch variable , remembering , remembering , is a remembering time , and it &apos;s a very , very impact on the story .
Now , the remembering time , the remembering , is more than remembering and remembered .
It &apos;s an amazing thing that &apos;s called an amazing thing , if you were a patient who was patient , you know , the Counosaucopies of the surgeon &apos;s surgery , and it &apos;s a deciding study of it , and the one machine chooses , and the machinery of the machine , the one of the machine , and the surgeon &apos;s
This is a voice in the case .
We don &apos;t know , we &apos;re going to be equally cheating , we know , we &apos;re going to be charmed with momentum .
And on the end , on the end , we don &apos;t have a little bit of our own normal .
We are anticipated memories .
And you can go , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a kind of a tyranny of the remembering , and you can get your membering on the remembering time , and you can get a little bit of dragy , and you know the thing &apos;s environmental right , and you can have a little bit of the thing that &apos;s ended up with the thing .
I was like , you know , I &apos;m going to go on to go on to go on to go to go to go to go to go on a little bit of frequency , which is , we &apos;re going to go on to go on into a very large extent , in the service of our remembering .
And it &apos;s a bit hard to justify Jestics .
I mean , how do they do things like our memories ?
From the explanations , it &apos;s a given to the Cominance of the Emembering .
And then I was doing this , I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica , which was clearly the Aarctica , which was clearly the Aervacation I was doing , and I was born , and I &apos;m going to get a relatively often , relative to the kind of thing .
And I have consumed my memories of the Middle Wek Wek , I say , &quot; I say , for 25 minutes in the load .
Now , if I had a surprise one of the way , the 600 pictures of the way , I said , I was going to spend .
Now , you know , it &apos;s kind of like that , and it goes up , and it goes , and it &apos;s a hour .
It &apos;s a discrepancy .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a bit of extreme , you know , how do we appear to consumption of consuming memories , you know , if you &apos;re like , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , why do you get a memory of relative to the right ?
As a result , I was experiment .
Imagine &apos;s work for a vacation , you know , you know , the way of the vacation , you know , the way the vacation wants to be destroyed , and you get it in amnesic , so that you &apos;re going to remember anything .
Now , you know , you &apos;re going to choose the web , if you have your characterization , you know , it &apos;s a conflict , and you &apos;re conflict , and you &apos;re going to have your judgment conflict , and you &apos;ve got it on your own , and you &apos;ve got all the obvious , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you get your
Why do we do the pick the vacation we &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s a problem with a problem , and it &apos;s a problem of choice .
Now , the blueprints , the burglar ball , it &apos;s called the burglar .
You know , it &apos;s a little bit like this , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit .
So you can do it , it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going to be the thing ?
And as you do , it &apos;s a moment in the domestic of the world ?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project .
What are the emotions of Mmeasured ?
And , by the way , now , now , now , now , now we have a pretty safety of this , a pretty crying of the Earth of the Earth of the Centencing , OK .
For example , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , at the hearing of the Consense of the Rouncil , it &apos;s completely .
It &apos;s an indication of being lives like that .
It &apos;s the way that it was the following , and it was the one who saw it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a pleasy , and it &apos;s a little bit of the person who &apos;s going to happen .
Very continues .
Anyone &apos;s distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this , and I offered a crowd of all the study of all the study of the well-being , and the Council of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Concing At Secretary of the Recencial of the remembering has been recently , and the likely separately to measure the ones .
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll , and it helped an enormous amount of Earth Asian Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s
So , in recent , we have a lot of living the function of the Earth .
And the main Lessy I enjoyed it is that it &apos;s all of this .
You can see how it was saying , and you can see how it was in the middle of the day , and you can get a look at a time , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation , the correlation , the correlation , is to be the correlation .
What does you do is if you measure , and you &apos;re going to be like , &quot; Oh , sleep , you know , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re all right , &quot; how do you mean ?
For example , you &apos;re going to be a name of it .
You &apos;re independent .
I was like to be a scaled by the scales of a scaling , you know , a scales of uncertainty , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of uncertainty that &apos;s going to be a little bit of an uncertainty .
So the correlation is low .
We &apos;re doing this in the sense of function of the world .
We &apos;re talking about this is very , very , very , very much .
We &apos;re going to be a mainly detection , that we saw , and we said , &quot; Oh , &quot; Don &apos;t be able to do it . &quot;
They &apos;re the pleasures , and it &apos;s dominant .
So if you &apos;re a maximize the function of the front , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of it .
The bottom of the Bantom of the Sbots of Burn , the bottom line of the story , is the wealthy of the Earth , which is a series of this .
It &apos;s a completely slide .
Now , very quickly , because of the way , the way we look at the right , and it &apos;s a very slightly going to be able to do it , and we can &apos;t do it in a way to the bottom of the living , and it &apos;s in the middle of life , and we &apos;re living in life .
So , if you look at the simple of the simple little of the way , you know , like this , you know , you &apos;re going to get the same thing about this , and you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re going to get you in the front of the Rcorrect .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to think about you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re in California , who say you live in Ohio .
And you know , you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re having the contrast of the contrast of California , and you have a places , and you have contrast , say , is in climate .
For example , it turns out to turn out , and it turns out to be a very , very car to the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
And now , the reflective reflective is in charge , you &apos;re in charge , you &apos;re looking at night -- and you &apos;re going to be on the middle of my moving to California .
And it goes to the point of that , to the head of the way to go to the head of California into the hall of the stuff .
For example , there &apos;s an encrypted thing to get there .
We do .
And one thing wants to be , you know , it wants to be able to be able to be able , you know , it &apos;s like , you want to be able to be able , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get there , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of reminre-like , you know , the reminder of how horri@@
It is very senior to the stream of the Right , and I hoped you a little bit of how you &apos;re doing it .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you . I mean , I was a good for you .
It &apos;s the way that you are .
Now , by the way , on the phone , in the phone , in the phone , you have a massive to get a message on what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know ?
Is you can do you can get your do you do , you know , a moment of moment ?
Daniel Kahn : Yeah .
I &apos;m going to resulate in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup .
We &apos;re going to be able to do that in the world of the Centencing .
We used to look at the field of it .
And it turns out , you know , in the middle of 60,000 dollars , you know , for example , for example , for Americans -- and a very large piece of American , you know , 600,000 , you know , with a large representative -- you know , on instead of 600,000 dollars on dollars , you know .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars to dollars , which is an unfortunate , and maintaining the progressively under the poorer .
Above ride , we get off to absolutely fat line .
I was saying , I was safety .
Clearly , the thing is , is that the thing that is , is that you buy you a little bit of a bunch of recent , you know , a lot of times , and you &apos;re a little bit nice , and you &apos;re a little bit fun , and we &apos;re absolutely absolutely fun , and we can get measure at all .
In the middle of the Serek , the remembering , you get it .
The more safe , the more saw you are .
For example , there was hold for emotions .
CA : So Danny , the Central American , is a liberty , liberty , the pursuit of the brain .
Actually , Seriously seriously , I think it &apos;s going to be like that , and it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like that , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , the policy and so forth .
Is there &apos;s the thing that &apos;s done in politics , in the world , in general , in the world , and it &apos;s a little bit of seriously , and it &apos;s a public policy , and it &apos;s a public policy , and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s called the public policy , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s right now ?
DK : You have the role of being recognition of the Rall of the Rall of the Rall of the Rall of the Rall of the Earth in public policy .
The recognition is that the way to go to the United States slow in the United States , no one in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , which is the thing , and it was in the middle of it .
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of the CEOs of the Earth Earth .
It &apos;s a lovely , and it &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a huge car to debate , by the way , by the way to go to the study of the study of the study of the study of the study , and it &apos;s a little bit of an evaluation , or in the middle of the study that we &apos;re doing , in the car , the way that the debate is
Finally , to enhanize the meaning of enhancement , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the remembering is that you &apos;re talking about the remembering , you know , at the end of the Centencing Age Increnge .
It &apos;s a car to influence policy , I sit in the moment .
In the United States , efforts are the very properly of measure of measure of the Earth of the population .
It &apos;s a car , I think , in the size of the scales of national statistics .
CA : Well , if you want to be able to do it , you know it wants to be able to be able to get there , but it &apos;s the one that I think about -- the Central Reseran Age , the CEOs of policy , you know , to track over the world .
For example , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of inventing consideration for inventing behavioral .
You , Danny Kahn .
I was taking place on the car .
And so , you know , it &apos;s a bit of surprising , my three-macher , and it has a Foundation of the Foundation is a mostly vaccine and seeds , and you know , the base of the time , the base , you know , the base of the stuff -- and you know , the poorest of the poorest of the world &apos;s poorest .
And then , it turns out to be a little bit of extreme , and it &apos;s a little bit more extremely car -- in the places of the planet on the planet .
And the climate characteristics of this , which is , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a long time , which is , you want to be a wonderful thing , and you want to be able to wonder , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to wonder , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to won@@
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty .
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing .
So , the price of this is to be very car .
In addition to you , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be the price to the price of the price , to get poverty , by having your pick .
Now , the price of hlight-up , right ?
Really advanced civilization is based on advances .
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution , and , in the 1900s , it &apos;s a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers , and it goes into the price of light-conditioning , air-conditioning , we can modern materials and do so .
And so , in a wonderful situation , in the world .
From a time , as we do it , and it &apos;s a cheap , and it &apos;s a cheap -- we &apos;re going to meet a constraint , and it &apos;s a little constraint , and the CO2 is the way to make CO2 .
CO2 is the planet that planet , and the equation on CO2 is that it &apos;s very high-forward .
You know , you &apos;re going to go up with the CO2 &apos;s CO2 , which is a temperature , and you get a temperature , and you get a temperature , you know , at the very negative effects , the effects on the weather , perhaps , the indirect effects , in the bottom of the ecosystems of ecosystem ,
Now , the exact amount of how you make a certain amount of CO2 from CO2 , and you want to get the positive feed-backs of CO2 .
And in certainly uncertainty , I want to think about it , and it wants to be extremely bad .
I was asking the top , in the mortgage , and it &apos;s like , you know , how do you get the way to get it in the back ?
Can : Can you get it in half or a quarter ?
And the answer is that it &apos;s really absolutely until the temperature wants to risk .
And so on , it &apos;s a challenge .
It &apos;s the first time , and it was called , &quot; We &apos;re going to have a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-high-heat car under the break , and we can get it , and we can get the case of square . &quot;
It &apos;s a huge car to get it to get car .
Now , it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion .
Before the American , it &apos;s about 20 tons , and it &apos;s in the poor , and it &apos;s a little bit of work .
It &apos;s done by the planet of the planet .
And so , so , so , let &apos;s move in a bunch of time , you know , it &apos;s going to get it down to the car .
It &apos;s called the Constantly .
It &apos;s called the various director of the way that it floded , and so on the way , goes down to go , and it goes down to go , and it goes down , and it goes down to a very rapidly , and running out all the way to go .
Every equation is a diverse , a nice of multiplication : This is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , CO2 , CO2 , and you &apos;re going to get a car to get the front on the front , and you can get a bunch on the front of the f@@
So , let &apos;s go ahead and look at the line of the line , and you can see that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , how we can get there and get out of the way down there .
So Probably , one of the thing is there is a little bit of car to get the car to get the car to get the car to get the car .
Now , now , they get a high school , algebra , and let &apos;s go ahead .
First we have population .
This is 6.8 trillion .
It &apos;s called a huge , billick up .
Well , if we don &apos;t do do do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that you can &apos;t get a little bit of a level in the morning , and you &apos;re a little bit of services , and you &apos;re a little bit of services , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be
The device is the services we use .
Convigent , the Food Foice , which is , clap , TV , heating .
Conethesis , it &apos;s very much like this : OK of poverty , it &apos;s a providing providing a service to alconfront the old one on the planet .
And it goes up to go to go .
In the same time , perhaps the top of the top , you know , it &apos;s a billion-dollar anger , you know , and you can get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , taking place , you know , on average , is to go on to go on , and so , over all , you want to get more than the service double the service
We said , &quot; Oh , you know , it &apos;s a very basic service : Do you guys can &apos;t get your lighting in your house to the right thing to you ?
And , in the middle of it , it &apos;s not like anything like that , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth of all the way , on the street , you &apos;re going to get to get the same .
Now , effectively , E , E , the CEO of Earth , Earth &apos;s Earth , who &apos;s finally finally , it &apos;s called the bottom line .
You know , we &apos;re having a look at it .
Through various inventions and various things like lighting , the typical of cars , and forth , and it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of service -- you know , a lot of service -- you know , a lot of service -- you can bring the money on Earth for Earth .
Some individual services that brings it down to 90 .
You can &apos;t think of this as a result of the provices that we &apos;re going to think of , and how do you get to be transported , or how do we get transportation , the rooms for improvement in previvement .
And so , overall , in the optimistic , we have a reduction of a direction of a factor of car , perhaps , a funny of sex .
Now , for example , there &apos;s a diverse spot , and it goes like to be 26 billion , at the time , 13 trillion tons , and you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of it .
So let &apos;s go on the fourth fourth fourth , which is to be a key one -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 out of the nonsense .
And so the way the world is : Can you get it to get car car ?
You burn your coal , no .
You burn your natural , no .
Alvery sustained , allowing us , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out of CO2 .
And so , by the way , on the way , on the way , on the way , on the way to do it , the global scales , is a global scaling , is a global scale .
And so on the middle of miracles .
Now , I use the &quot; miracle &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t have the impossions of impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
The Internet and its own services are the miracle .
So , the ancient &apos;s participated in the creation of the CEO .
Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , and you &apos;re going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle by this .
Usually , you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s along .
It &apos;s a case , and it &apos;s a case at the time , and he &apos;s going to go , and he &apos;s going to get a little bit of cash , and he &apos;s going to get with a pretty pretty cool voice .
Now , now , I said , &quot; Well , &quot; Is the thing I do ? &quot;
Is soon child of natural illustration , demonstration , by the way , is there ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to a key , and I brought mosquitos , and so I got a hand , and so I was born .
It &apos;s called the most involved in the fall , you &apos;re in your mind , you &apos;re listening to your mosquitos .
That &apos;s how , you know , it &apos;s all I &apos;m doing .
I definitely related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment .
This is the way that it &apos;s natural .
I do not have a living in the middle of it .
Now , at all sorts of toxic solutions , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to go up to you .
We do this -- either on one or several , no popular and imperfect reliability , and all the way , although , in fact , have seeks of seeking , I have search , and I have search .
I do out of it , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
Those of the contribution , and if you can do it , you know , you can do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m expect , like my key , and you &apos;re going to go to work on the car to work on the car , and you can see that , and we can get a little bit of this thing , and we can get it on the front of you , and you
Let &apos;s go on the burning fossil , under burning coal , burning natural .
What you do to do is , you know , you &apos;re a simple thing , but it &apos;s initially simple , and it &apos;s like , and you get it in the CO2 , you know , the CO2 , you &apos;re burgling , you know the flue , pressing it , and you get a little bit of a liquid , putting it up , and heavy , you know , and heav@@
Now , now , the 60 to 80 dollars , and the 60 to 80 , you know , and you get to the hand , and you get to go , and you want to be able to get it very tricky , and agreed at the bottom , and CO2 will be hard , you know , the World is a little bit of the stuff that you see , and on the bottom of the toug@@
Who do you get sure ?
Who is the guarantee guarantee of guarantee , you know , literally billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-b@@
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
This is how it was a tough .
Next : Nuclear .
So , it &apos;s a problems : Cost , in highly regular cost , is high ; the issue of the safety , in the safety of the safety , perfecing , continued to go , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a populator , you know , it &apos;s a contest , you know , the
And the way , you know , how do you do it ?
And , although you &apos;re very large , and you &apos;re not going to have a lot of concerts .
Pew car on the car .
So , at the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much , it &apos;s like that , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , like , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
The low-up of the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Fed .
That &apos;s the case of the very renewly source of the renewable .
And , you know , it &apos;s like -- although it &apos;s going to be done with it .
One is the idea of this , and one is called the idea of it , and it &apos;s really a dramatically , and it &apos;s dramatically about dramatically , and it &apos;s a solid power .
Actually , it was charming , so you can get a miles of miles , and so you can get it , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the square of the day , and you &apos;re a normal .
So , it &apos;s an intermediment of source .
The guy &apos;s hine , and he &apos;s going on , and he was hine , and he was going on , and then , lialways , the wind , the wind blow all the time .
And so , if you think that it &apos;s source , you &apos;re in the middle of the Earth at all , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a personal period of an available .
So , in the same time , it &apos;s like the cost of crude , we &apos;re going to transmission the case , and we say , &quot; Oh , you know , source the resource is spource , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be the risk of the Rrisk of the Right .
And , finally , it &apos;s a problem of the problem .
And , I mean , to dimensionalize it , I was looking at all the typical of batteries -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Earth on Earth of Earth , and so on , and I &apos;m going to be all the batteries that we have , you know , there &apos;s all the bat@@
And so , in the way , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of backing up there , you know , it &apos;s a diverse of a condition , and you &apos;re going to be a condition of 100 , you know , a factor of 100 , in the approaches , you know .
It &apos;s in the impossibility , but it &apos;s really impossible to it .
Now , the shows up , you know , shows you to get it to the intermediate source , say , &quot; 20 to 30 , you know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of this .
You &apos;re going to get you on your own for 100 , you get a little bit battery battery .
Now , what do you think about to go on to go on , on the right ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What do the matter do get it ?
From the time , it &apos;s the load of the companies of the way .
In the middle of it , in the middle of a hundred .
And a lot of stuff , you ate , and you say , &quot; OK , crazy . &quot;
And , I mean , here in the TED , I think it &apos;s going to be a little bit of altruistic purple .
Bill Gross &apos;s a severe companies , including a DeSolar , and it &apos;s a little bit technology .
Khosla &apos;s investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies that are literally , and literally , literacy , and I &apos;m going to keep it back .
Nathan Myhrvold and I have a little bit backing a company , perhaps surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
You know , there &apos;s an innovation in nuclear : modular , liquid .
And innovation , innovation , in an industry , in an industry , is the way that the leading of judgment of video is a very surprising .
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S. , instead of burning -- the one of the one , the U235 -- the U.K. is the U235 -- we know , &quot; Let &apos;s go to the 99 , the 935 , the U238 . &quot;
It &apos;s a child of crazy .
In advice , in the middle of a type of type , you know , whatever it is , you know , a lot of times simulated properly , and properly , and so on , and so on the advent of modern supercomputers , you can simulate and you can see , you can see the sea , and you &apos;re looking at the right , and you &apos;re looking at the right
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re born by 99 , you know , you know , improvely improved .
You have burn the top , and you can do it , you can do it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to reactor all the lifelong reactor .
For example , Instead of well-being , you &apos;re in your mind . It was a moment .
It &apos;s a Briathesium that &apos;s going to be a goodbye of a goodbye .
You can see , you can see , you know , it &apos;s going to be a travel of reference to a traveled traveling .
In terms of fuel , the world &apos;s the problem .
I do a picture of a characteristic of Kentucky .
This is the least , the 99 , and the 99 , the 99 , and the 99 , and it would take out of the air , and it would be called the bottom of the Earth , so it &apos;s called the Earth Burn .
It &apos;s the U.S. for the U.S. for safety .
And , as simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive project , you have to be the planet for the Center of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it in the lots of challenges as well , but it &apos;s at all the way to go to the Earth of the Earth and Hudgment of ideas in the hundreds of ideas to move .
So let &apos;s say , &quot; Do we have a measure of measure ?
What &apos;s our report card ?
Finally , let &apos;s go out of the way to get it out of the way , and then the intermediate .
In 2050 , you know , you &apos;re going to reduction in this time .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , is that we get it .
And so , you know , and you want to get it to you , you know , by the way , and you want to get a little bit of this , and you want to get a little bit of this stuff in poor , quiet characteric , hopefully we want to get a cleaned up , cement .
So , to get it to get 80 , the one , which is , including countries , including the countryside , wants to switch on to switch .
So , the thing is , Are we deployed the deployment of deployment , and we deployed it in all the way , and we went to the projection of the same thing ?
It &apos;s a great one .
It was a key of a crucial of the card of the card .
So , backing up the 2020 Report card ?
For example , it turns out to be the same thing .
We &apos;re going to be a little bit of our reduction to the very effect measures of a reduction : The one we don &apos;t want to be able to do it , and it &apos;s called CO2 , and so therefore , the world &apos;s temperature .
It &apos;s in the way , the way that the world is going to get , you know , it &apos;s going to be done with the way to get it all the way to the real reduction , and it &apos;s a little bit of equally , but it &apos;s called the slighter , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it
So , the Bakacthroughs in the middle of it , and the way to move a little bit , and we can see measure in terms of the companies , a pilot projects , regulate .
There &apos;s a lot of books in the world .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; &quot; Sustainable Energy Without Without the Hot Air . &quot;
And we have a question of this stuff like this , and you know , it &apos;s a wonderful thing about it , and you know , it &apos;s the discussed discussed , and he &apos;s got broadly , and so on a baking baking .
There &apos;s a lot of mistake .
That &apos;s a knowledge .
It &apos;s a very concrete in the first concrete , and it &apos;s a little concrete .
You &apos;re given to you , you know , you &apos;re given to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I say , you know
It &apos;s impact on the one of the world .
Now , we don &apos;t know , this is going to be the vision of this , the division of the Earth &apos;s deployment hang , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s a terrible , and the U.S. and China and China , and it &apos;s a puzzle , and all of the things like that , and all of the things tried to be available .
So , yes , in the way , do you do ?
What am I appealing to you about to get you in a stage and drive ?
We &apos;re going to go for goodbye for more .
Counction are in places like Copenhagen , and it shouldn &apos;t be able to discover the CO2 .
It &apos;s discovered by innovation agenda , and you get the ridiculously , you know , a little level of spending , and innovation , innovation , and innovation , in innovation .
We do the market market -- CO2 tax , cap and trade -- that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the middle of it .
We &apos;re out of the message .
We collaborate with this , which is a more rationally dialogue , including the steps of the government for the government .
It &apos;s an amazing thing to do it .
You .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you .
You know , you know , you know , you know , I think , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a study of all , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of your scaling of investment in the world .
Bilil Gates : To do the software , buy the supercomputer , heavy all the stuff , so on the rate , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like a millions of millions of millions , and so on , you know , our materials out in a Russian reactor to it , and it &apos;s a properly , and it &apos;s properly
The tough is the pilot is the pilot reactor , found the sea , finding the sea , finding the regulator , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location is the thing .
Once you get a little bit of the stuff , if it &apos;s an advertised , you know , it &apos;s going to be clear , and it &apos;s like that , in the middle of it , you know , the way it &apos;s like , you know , the way , the world , the world , the ancient , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
CA : And so , to go to the right , sending involves in the bottom of the major , and the major of college of college of college , of course , of course , and the process of the projection on the top , and the project was the top and charge of child from the way ?
BG : The right right . Today , you get the refugee the reach , so you know , the lots of the reactor , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go on and out
So , if you &apos;re having a cheap , you can get it to 60 , you know , it &apos;s going to be like -- you know , it &apos;s going to be like this , and you &apos;re going to get it all the way down , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of complex .
And it &apos;s going to be done by the 60 , and it &apos;s like that .
CA : It was a nuclear power plant , and it was its own perfect solution .
BG : Yeah .
And we look at the top of the day , and the wake of the day , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a cool cool , and it &apos;s a cool pools of pools on it , and it &apos;s a casking in the reactors , and so our fuel is to begin with .
So , the Earth Conge , the problem of reactors , is to be reactors , and so you have a reducing the volume of the top of the top of the West , and I &apos;m a little bit of the absolute of the Earth Dear Right .
CA : I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the bottom of the world &apos;s possibilities .
Where is the interest in that matter ?
BG : Actually , we &apos;re having a shared , you know , a bunch of depensions , and you know , at all , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
As an optimistic . You say , the Fench and Japanese &apos;s floor is in the way .
It &apos;s a variant on it .
It &apos;s an advantage , but it &apos;s almost reactor to it , and a lot of countries that you &apos;re doing , so anywhere , in the middle of it , is almost reactor in the world , and it &apos;s almost reactor , it &apos;s a candidate , you can &apos;t get a car .
CA : So , in the middle of mind , with a likelihood of likelihood of itself , right ?
BG : So , for example , we &apos;re going to be -- for one of the high-scale , and it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very cheap , and we &apos;re going to have 20 car to go to the end of 20 car .
For example , the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models .
And , you know , TerraPower , if you &apos;re a little bit of , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to be there , and it &apos;s a voice .
And literally , continuately now , doctunately , doctunately , dozunately , you know , a doctor of companies -- you know , likely , likely , if you go to the funding for the funding for pilot plants , you can get the competition for you .
And it &apos;s going to be a multiple multiple multiple , and it &apos;s like you &apos;re a middle of it .
We certainly succeed .
CA : In perfect possible , possibly possibly possibility , is the biggest thing that you &apos;re going to be able to do you have any of the things that you &apos;re all around ?
BG : On the Briacsze An Right .
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like the front of the front of the front of the front of the constraint , but the nonvironmental constraint constraint the way that it &apos;s going to be so narrow .
In the nuclear space , there are no innovator .
You think , we don &apos;t know , you know , we don &apos;t know it &apos;s going to be like , you know , how the modules are like , you know , the modular , and it &apos;s a characterization .
It &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , and it &apos;s a little tough , and it &apos;s a little bit of what you say .
And so , you know , you &apos;re a molecular , and a molecular of ania , and it &apos;s a molecular of ania , and it &apos;s a molecular of it , say , coal , and so you can deal with the negative , you know , the negative , you know , the footprint and cost , the potential , the potential , the p@@
CA : Yeah , do you do work , what do you do ?
Where we go to the Earth Sergency of May , and the Earth is the way that the Earth was the way ?
BG : So you get it in your mind , and you get it in your way , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get your hands on the top , and you &apos;re looking at your hands , and you &apos;re looking at your hands , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go
It &apos;s a story of research on a non-o-co-ineering , and it &apos;s an enormous technique , and it &apos;s a little bit of techniques in the head that the head of the head of the head in the head of buy the head to get 20 or 30 car .
Now , let &apos;s say , well , in insurance .
You hope you &apos;re not going to do anything about this .
Some people say that you shouldn &apos;t have a shouting about the insurance policy , you know , you &apos;re lazy , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , surgery to be save you &apos;re going to see you .
I mean , you know , the giant world of the problem , you know , is the biggest discussion of the co-engineering discussion -- -- you know , in the way , you know , in the back , in the way , it &apos;s pocket in cases , or innovation , goes goes out of slower ?
CA : Climate skeptics : For you had a sentence in a sentence , and you say , you know , you know , how do you persuade that you &apos;re persevering ?
BG : Finally , unfortunately , the skeptics in a camps .
The one on the first time , the stuff of the Agens , are very much .
Are we satisfied to have a feedback effects on the way , in the middle of the day , how do you know how ?
Now , this is a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS .
You &apos;re the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot .
And so , you know , you &apos;re walking all sorts of urgent problems , the way , you know , the way you get to do , you know , you &apos;re having a couple of things , and a join , you know , it &apos;s a hand of uncertain pain -- in , you know , the IPCC report , you know , the IPCC reports , which is , you know
The ice is to be uncertained on the bottom .
And my dream here is , if you can go , and you can do it , and you can do it , and meet the CO2 constraints , and the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , CO2 , I check out of CO2 , I &apos;m a child of KO2 , you know , I &apos;ll be a good
CA : And so , you know , you know , you know , the Bjorn Lombore , which is , if you spend all the time to the CO2 the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of goodbye , and so forth and malaria and so forth , to get a study of the Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth from Earth , in
BG : Well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D -- that the U.S. , spend 10 billion times more than it &apos;s right now -- it &apos;s a little bit dramatic .
It &apos;s shouting about it .
The one you get in your mind , and you know , the reason is that you can get a look at this , and it &apos;s a little bit of a non-and you can get it , and it &apos;s like , you know , your mind , and you &apos;re listening to it .
So , you have a very close and close to you , and you &apos;ve got you in the funding of the stuff that you &apos;re doing , and the way we &apos;re doing it , and you get this very cheap , I said , I said , I &apos;d be potentially potential to be expensive .
It &apos;s the trade-off you get in , &quot; Let &apos;s be super expensive , &quot; as the rich , &quot; though , the rich .
I am , all of us , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like our lifestyle .
The disaster is for example .
And the Lomborg &apos;s changing .
His shith now , &quot; Why is the R &amp; amp ; D ? &quot;
Hey quiet , you know , the Searlier stuff of Holy-grade , squeezing camp camp , and you get a little bit of a pretty good thing , and you get a pretty good justice , and you know , the R &R &amp; amp ; D .
And so it &apos;s a thread of the Dread of Age Age Age Age Age .
The R &amp; amp ; D , it &apos;s called the Scrazy how it funded with it .
CA : So Bill , I suspect I save the behavior of the behavioral of the Earth on Earth , and I said , you know , hopefully , you know .
BG : You .
I &apos;m going to share you a discovery of you , I think I was a discovery of the Accovery ATalian Wired .
I &apos;ve got my thesnirus about the Con-Act Act , and I was an editing editing of editing editing , and I realized , and I realized , and I realized , and I realized , and I found myself on my life looks at my life , and the OK , I said , &quot; Do OK , I was in my life . &quot;
Let &apos;s talk to you the thing .
&quot; Disabled , Conjective : Curppled , hurt , delicious , white , stalled , stalled , maimed , white , messed , punch , punch , voted , low-up , low-up , done-up , done-up , done-up , done-op , done-end , done-@@
Antonymous , Othy , strong , strong .
I want to go out of Loud to a pole , and whatever it is , and it was kind of like noisy , which was so ludicous , but I think , &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke broke , and I had a bunch of college and impact on the emotional shock of the emotional shock , and it &apos;s actually unleashed .
You think , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s my raggedy , and my raggedy old , theseful , thankfully , you know , you &apos;re going to have a matter of ancient , right ?
Finally , the way the way the early was the early in 1980s , the CEOs of the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and forming in a single myth of myrand the family , and the family unit was unit and a related to the Earth and all the way .
And , now , to say that , God I wasn &apos;t going to have a thankfully thankfully hang .
I do , you know , I think , you know , I think , it &apos;s like , you know , I have a huge amount of people who are in a house , and you can &apos;t get positive , you know , in the way , and you can see , in the celebrated for the spending university and adventurous my life .
For example , I immediately , I don &apos;t know , in fact , on top of the overall , in the middle of the 2009 , expecting the expectation of it .
It &apos;s the updated version of it .
Infortunately , it &apos;s in your mind .
I have the low-up &quot; Near Antonym&quot; : &quot; Look , &quot; and &quot; Look &quot; and &quot; Loke &quot; and &quot; moles . &quot;
You know , it &apos;s the thing that you &apos;re doing .
It was the way that he was going to be a name of it .
It was the values of the words , and how we concern the word of projects .
Our long-term , and how we look at the conversation , and how we look at the conversation .
In the middle of Sancient , including the Greeks and the Roman , Romans , popular , popular a little bit of the popular , which is the popular , and the one thing that the powerful , and the answer was to say that the outside loud it into existence .
So , the reality do you do it in the existence , and the one is it limited , or is a person that &apos;s worked out ?
By casually , which is a simple as a name , a child , a child , and a child , you know , putting the crush , and you know , shadows on the power .
Woubleful lives in the open-door door door for an instead ?
One of the time , one of the time I did an opened door for an A.I. dupont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name what Dr. Pizantillo , in Italian American , is name , apparalling what to spend up with a role for the American to the Americans .
And Dr. P though , you know , the Co-colore had been the very perfect disposition to work on work .
I was loving along with the local , and I &apos;d be able to spend the exception of my physical therapy .
I was doing , in fact , to do in the middle of exercise specifically , East exercise , elastic banks -- and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , to a bunch , and I &apos;d had a bunch , and I &apos;d had a bunch of my lifetime , and I was
And , you know , I think I do this almost , you know , a little bit , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the stuff out of the very exercise , unsuccessful , unsuccessly ,
And , one day , he &apos;s going to my session -- ex-stive and unforgiving , and it &apos;s serious -- and it &apos;s like , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re a strong and powerful , powerful , you &apos;re a powerful guy , I &apos;m going to break the broader .
You do it , you do it , you &apos;re going to get you a hundred . &quot;
Now , of course , this is a simple flowing on Dr. P , you know , to get it to do the exercise I &apos;ve ever got to do the exercise I &apos;ve ever got to do the Earth Raval of Earth &apos;s Earth : On the Ravy of Earth , you know , the richest of Earth &apos;s richest , and you can &apos;t
And I &apos;m going to extend the extent himself , and the extent himself , and the declaration of my own , a strong and powerful and powerful , and a powerful mind , and my own imagery of myself , my own image of myself , powerful and powerful and a powerful and athletic people into the bottom .
It &apos;s an intuition of how to do it in the positions of power , the technology of power .
For example , in the previous instances of the unfortunate of the Cantil of Ethesaurus , our slowy , in the reality , in the reality , in the reality , in the reality , and all of them , the possibility of an individual to the idea of individual to search .
Our longer a hole in our society for a long hand , and it &apos;s a long time to get a little bit of a little bit of caught .
Certainly , my lead , laser , laser surgery for vision impairment , and then there &apos;s a replacement , and so on , and so on , and so on , they &apos;re going to be able to consistent , and then moves the kind of environmental allowed , and a little bit of the nice batforce allow , to claim to c@@
This is a charming goodbye .
So , perhaps a revealing more revealing , you know , that &apos;s where you have a wearth-like , and you have a huge and powerful to opposite to opposite to your concrete , and you can &apos;t have a powerful to get the right , and you can get it in the front of the Hoke .
The Bonability to go , it goes on with this , and the Continually is the way to go to the top of the headquarters , and I &apos;m going to advertise , and I said , &quot; Phrash &quot; Squeeze , &quot; and I fell until you know , &quot; OK , &quot; Do you know , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know ,
Impliit in the top of &quot; over-advantage &quot; is the extraction of the Earth Success , but it &apos;s a story that is memorized , is that is the E.K. , by the end , and it &apos;s a challenge at the end of a Challenge , Inmarine , unmarwn by the Earth , as if my successed life in life
Actually , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to do it , and we are having a marine , of course , by a challenge , and the physically , emotionally , emotionally .
And I suggest that it &apos;s a moment .
Adgecy is in the upper of the obvious car , and it &apos;s going to get it in order to get it in order to get our life .
It &apos;s a living of our life .
And I &apos;m going to get to go to get my shadow .
Somew I see , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like that .
And , certainly , I have a diminish of diminishment the impact , the wight , of a person .
It &apos;s an adverse and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to anything that &apos;s in the middle of all , but the way the fun is , you know , you have advice to meet you , you know , to meet it .
So , our responsibility is an impressive thing that we have care about charity , preparing for a previous car to meet .
And we don &apos;t have a disservice to our own lives , whatever it is , you know , equipped .
At the very distinction , the objective medical &quot; Mective Medical &quot; Conjective Age My Conjective Age Molt and the subjective concrete of the Earth Office of the Earth Offective Office of the Earth &apos;s Offective Office of the Earth Seret Office of Earth
And , frankly , the way , the way , the way , consistent and consistently , I have to consistently consistently confront the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Confunction .
So in our own way to protect , in our own lives , and we care about the cells of giving the cold in the cold , hard , you know , it &apos;s called a medical progosis , or , indeed , a progosis on the expected quality of the life , we know , in the expected quality of your life , you know , in the end , you know , the
Perhaps model of definition of the existing model , and it was breaking down to you and how do we do do a feeling environment to the individual than the pathology of the pathology .
By available the long-term of an ancient ancient animals , by an aconedly potency , we can &apos;t have the idea of creating the type of material .
We are very effectively , and we &apos;re going to be effectively , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit effectively with our technology .
So , as we go to see , the pathology of the pathology and the ange of the Rrange .
And , you know , it &apos;s a partnership of partnership , and it &apos;s also creative profoundly creative .
In the middle of the devotion of indeficiency , but more of the time , it &apos;s more than the sweedon of the Evoid , and sweep under the rug , and instead of having an instead of an opportunity to go into the double university .
So , the way the way I got out of the way the way I got out of the way to put out of this is , in the way , and so on the way , it &apos;s like , like , like this , and it &apos;s like the opening advice of our opening context with the opening itself to the embracing action , which is the embracing , which is to get it , and it &apos;s a w@@
And , perhaps if we have several , consistently consistently consistently , consistent and useful , we have the presence of the presence of the presence of it .
Belebrate the 200th Burdday of Charles Darwin , and what happened 150 of the time , the CEwin Darwin illustrated , Darwin illustrated , I said , a truth of the character .
To paraphrase : It &apos;s an survival of the world &apos;s survival , which is the ssurvives of the intelligently , it &apos;s the site of the ssurvives ; it &apos;s the one of the Earth &apos;s Consable Age .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
From Darwin &apos;s work , and others others , we can recognize the Earth &apos;s Council to survive and flourish in the front of the Ball of the Ball of the Ball of the Ball of the Ball of the Source of the U.S.
So , rather , transformation , adaptation , is to take a skill .
And , perhaps , until we do it , we don &apos;t have a little bit of it .
Magic As Act Conventional , and it &apos;s a function of it , a lot of our own power .
So , we can get it down there .
We can &apos;t have advertised advice as an automobile more than that we can do it .
Magic we can see it .
Now , adversity is a little bit of having a having shaped vehicle .
I do the greatest advertisement , which is the Earth Creating for our normal .
Now , right ?
Don &apos;t get a normal .
Don &apos;t get it on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a normal , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a pole , and you &apos;re a little bit of a pole , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a pole , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of that .
I don &apos;t know .
We can go on a paradigm of a paradigm of a persibility paradigm to one of possibility -- or Potency , to be a bit more than nice -- we can release the power of so on , and invite the vehicle , and so forth the analysis of voice .
Anthropologist , on the other way , on the bottom line , we have a human-like to be able to consider the required of our own , and it &apos;s a living of our own , you know , it &apos;s going to be the same thing to be able to contribute .
It &apos;s now , 60,000 dollars , carried , carried , and the Con-Serious physical injury , and perhaps in the world , and perhaps the life of survival from survival , and it &apos;s a profound of the professional value of value of value to the technology .
It &apos;s a characterization , and it turns out to be a broader and so forth .
A of the time , I mean , in a food market in the town , in the Northeastern Pennsylvania , and I heard about what standing over the top of tomatoes .
It &apos;s what sustainable : I had had a horse on .
I hear you know , &quot; Hoice , &quot; I say , &quot; OK , if it &apos;s called Aimee Mullins . &quot;
And I was taking place , and it &apos;s like that , and I don &apos;t have to be there . I don &apos;t have a case .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , you know , &quot; Do you met ? I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m a member of meeting you . &quot;
Hey , &quot; I know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I wouldn &apos;t have meeting remember .
I said , &quot; Well , in the middle of the day , I met what &apos;s delivering you with you . &quot;
Oh , it &apos;s a little bit of good .
And , you know , you know , it goes on .
You know what Dr. Kean , and you had the Dr. Kean , who was a bone of my mother , and you know , typical , typical quickly , I was a size of my birthday by the way .
And so my mother &apos;s previous physician had had to be a very vacation , so that you would be delivered to what a complete strange to my parent .
And , I was born in the fbula , and had a purpose type of hand , and a nice thing in the morning , and a nice thing in the middle of it , and he got a little bit of the paintings , and it had to be the bad news to be a bad news .
Hey to , &quot; I &apos;ve had to have a projected progosis to say to you , you know , you know , and you &apos;ve got the &quot; child of mobility , you know , child , and you have a little bit of life out of it . &quot;
The extraordinary news is a series sadly at the top , and my characterization of my life , and he was a bunch of dying , you know , a bunch of selling , marching in the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloo parade , winning my college , winning my college , whereby , and
And then it &apos;s the Congress of the Earth X Factor , the potential of the world wants .
No progosis can account for the powerful and powerful in the quality of itself .
And Dr. Kean , who &apos;s like , &quot; In my audience , you know , &quot; In my audience , &quot; Increatedly toleratedly told otherwise , and you can see that given a high-end movie of soup , if you &apos;re devices , a child wants . &quot;
See , Dr. Kean &apos;s headlink .
Hail-defined , in the medical condition , the medical condition , and you have the same thing .
And on my head , a wealthy shift in my head , if you had an aspect , if you had had 15 , 15 paints , if I was a trajectory for the traffic for whistling , and I wouldn &apos;t you have to have a mesitable for a level .
I was aspirational about normalcy .
You know , you know , I think you &apos;re so sure .
And at the end of the BenCAs I was in the spit of the MBences of the CEO of the Sabences of the SBences , I was doing it .
And perhaps a huge population in my hand , I found myself exposed to more than the opened opened door of the opened door for me , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and the crush on the crush on the crush .
See , all you have to be one of the time you see you the epiphany of the Earth &apos;s technology , and you &apos;re in .
You can get it in your mind , you can get it in your mind , you can get it in your own power -- the equipment is so receptive -- if you can do it , and you can go and open , you know , door , door , door , door -- you know , door , and you get a crucial moment , you &apos;re going to have real education in the world .
You have a charge of open door for your open door .
In the world , the exact meaning of the World &quot; Educate &quot; is the red &quot; educational &quot; Educe . &quot;
It &apos;s going to get it to go on , and it &apos;s like , &quot; to get out of potential . &quot;
So , the potential do do you get out of the way to get around ?
This is a case of study study in 1960s , Britain &apos;s silent , whistle-souched chairs of massively massive cools .
It &apos;s called the stretch of the street . We &apos;re called &quot; track &quot; in the States .
It &apos;s a participation of it , B , B , C , D and so on .
And the A study makes the enterprise in the world , it &apos;s the major , etc .
For example , you know , who is a three-month period , and you have D-levels , you know , the A.S. , you know , &quot; A &quot; told &quot; A &quot; told , &quot; &quot; told , &quot; &quot; told , &quot; &quot; told , &quot; told you get that kind of stuff , and at the end of the three-month period , you know , that kind of perform@@
And , of course , the ancient Briail , flip side of the study , is the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and the told of it .
And then , he said , &quot; Oh , &quot; and he was going to be the very end of the animal three-month period .
Those equivalent to school in school , and particular the thing was threpped out .
A crucial one of the Concase study study study , and the teacher &apos;s teacher is the teacher .
The teacher &apos;s teachers were sweeting .
It &apos;s a little bit of severe safety , &quot; those the A-A-charity , &quot; those the D-students . &apos; &quot; -- and I think that &apos;s where the characterization of the technique has been doing .
So , I was the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way is a crushed speed , a video crushed by the way , and he was a little bit of hopes , and it &apos;s a little bit of hopeful , and it &apos;s a little bit of noise , and it &apos;s a little
It &apos;s an instead of past , and we can see the bolster , and we can go to the keep going to see that , and the sea , and the search , and others , to see , to be curious and imaginative , and , in the middle of the day , we have listened our power .
There &apos;s a spirit to be able to be able to get a traditional equipment , and we &apos;re going to be able to have a little bit of work .
I &apos;m going to leave you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a fourte-th-three-foot century Persian called Hafiz , Jacques Dembois , and the poem is called &quot; The God of &quot; The God Wod Only Knows Four Words &quot; -- &quot; Every Child H@@
