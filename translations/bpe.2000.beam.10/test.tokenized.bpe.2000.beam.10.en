Several published , TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow .
And the very pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple : teams of the Middle At the test standing up the talling of the test in 20 sticks of spaghetti , and one yard of tape , on-yard of Sting and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow hand is to be .
And , in fact , that certainly makes sense of the pretty pretty pretty collaborative device on collaborate very quickly .
And so I think about what was going on , and I incorporated it into a design shop .
And what a huge is looking for .
And then , you know , I &apos;m spending 70 designs in 70 design , and designed and designers and architects , the CTOs of the Fortune &apos;s 50 , and the CEO of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune
So , normally , it &apos;s taken by orienting themselves in the world .
It &apos;s like , characteristics out of it , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , jucky .
There &apos;s a lot of planning planning , organizing , sketch on the spaghetti .
This is the majority of the majority of the sticks with the sticks into ever-tools .
And then finally , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , like , you know , outside the marshmallow , and it turns out to be like , and it turns out to be like , and it stood up , and it was a day , and it was a chunch of work .
On the heart of the day , it &apos;s called the &quot; tye &quot; and &quot; Tuh-oh &quot; &quot; U.K. , &quot; sight of the marshmallow circle of the marshmallow &quot; collapse . &quot;
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of stuff like that , you know , it &apos;s a lot of &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment , and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates .
Something , you know , cheat , the map of districted and so forth .
And of course , of course , technically teams of disease , by the time , &quot; tac-da &quot; worth , and among the absolutely recent graduate .
And it was amazing .
At Peter tells us , perhaps , you know , you know , you know , pretty much , you know , pretty much , you know , pretty much , you know , what &apos;s going to happen in the world , you know , the world &apos;s environment .
So the bottom line : is that ? Why ? What is it ?
And Peter liffs to say , you know , none of the Men of the PEOs , you know , CEO of Spaghetti , Inc . Right ?
It &apos;s not a little bit of jucky power .
For example , it &apos;s a very well .
And the reason is a bunch of business , trained to the sound right now , right ?
And the execute on it .
And , by the time , the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top , call out of the mouth of it .
It was a crisis .
Right ? Right .
What major do differentiate is called the marshmallow , and the photograph prototypes , successive prototypes , low-keeping the marshmallow , so multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way .
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project .
And the version of that , you get , you get , you get , you get a little bit of feeling feedback in your head .
So the thing in prototyping with a prototype is essential , and let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on .
So the average , for example , is about 20 inches , and business schools , a half of them ; lawyer , a characterization , and indeed , intrinsically , crossed , evidence .
Who does this matter ?
Architect and engineer , thanky .
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world .
And so on , you know , it &apos;s going to be the triangular and self-cleaned geetetrical powered geetrical patterns in the world .
So CEOs , a piece of that CEOs , a little bit of an average .
You put you on executive adminances on the team , the significantly .
It &apos;s called you . You know , you &apos;re going to go , you go , you go , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Win the way . &quot;
You can be conscious . You can get it .
It &apos;s a little bit of skills of divertation .
Sometimes the project is the project .
And whatever , you know , team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team .
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress up on the study strong .
You know , you &apos;re having typically a type of typical performance , you &apos;re going to get you , you know , you get some kind of thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s the way that you have , you know , it &apos;s kind of like this .
And I tried .
I do , let &apos;s go once .
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning .
So how do you know , how do you get to be done with a design , what design students ?
What about the world ?
And he said , &quot; No one team had had a standing in a standing .
Now , anyone had a piece of sharing , say , &quot; On one in the middle of the world , the price of the brain .
Like , isn &apos;t it ? However , high staces are impact .
We arrived at the exercise on the exercise .
What do you do ?
This is the wealth of prototyping .
So this is the bottom of the very , very much , the very way to think about the stuff .
Finally , the tallest of it in the least is in the least amounts .
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a marshmallow , you know , you &apos;re having a marshmallow ?
And the reason is , I &apos;m making a processing tools and processing processing cars and video in visual effects .
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day .
Frankly , frankly , the project has marshmallow , right ?
The challenge provides provides the challenge , and a slide of a long time , a little bit of a purpose to the build the right .
And so , you know , the value of the City of the Conence , of the simple exercise .
And the idea of you guys are going to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It &apos;s just a bunch of it , you can get a bunch of the marshmallows .
Final by-step-by-step steps .
You know , it &apos;s a little bit of crazy fuzy , you know , it &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like this stuff like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s going to address the system .
You see , you can &apos;t record it , you know , it &apos;s going to be there .
And the fundamental lesson , I think , is a design , design is a contact .
It demands on it , and it goes all of our head to the top , and it goes up the very all of our own , our fellow , our fellow and our case to the challenge .
And , you know , a prototype of Earth &apos;s prototype , you know , it &apos;s all the way to turn it into a two-oh type of moment to a nuh-oh .
And that &apos;s a little bit differently .
All right .
Let &apos;s move forward right now .
A more machine , a cool , TEDish machine , and it machine , it machine .
And you put it in the way to get it into it .
And you can get goodbye , you can go forwards ; you can &apos;t have you .
And I wonder , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was boreful , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , you know , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and you know , all the way to go to
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to go to go to go to go back and Twitter , or Twitter , &quot; American Idol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I was convinced with nonviolent , of pull to nostalgia , to knowledge .
And I do .
I mean , I felt like , Crowd , I said to say .
I don &apos;t know about going to go back , and it &apos;s called an adventurous way .
It seems to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it , and it goes back to this , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be done , you know , Congo , Congo .
As I do to get it in the machine , and I graduated from Gochine .
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the machine , and it &apos;s based on a focus on the planet , and it &apos;s basically choose to choose , and Walth , mobility , audience , declining rates of disease ...
It was a matter of mind .
My great-graded participation , all of it , by the time , by 60 .
My grandparents pushed 70 .
My participation of my participated in 80 .
This is how it was a nine at the beginning of my death .
After all , it &apos;s a bigger , and it &apos;s a bigger deal .
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi really expect to live excitement to live in the bottom of the world in the middle 100 .
Think , you know , it &apos;s going to be done for that .
And does it happen ?
Smallpox . Smallpox kiled billions of work on the planet .
It was reshaped the demographic of the globe in a way .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a Dvanished .
We vanquish it . Puff .
For example , in the same time , threatened millions of us there is no longer , hardly .
Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
Is it going to be there ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to be fed billions of stuff , which is the foundation of the Centch method .
And to my mind , the Centh method -- stupid stuff out there , so it changed the way it works , is one of the Saccomplishments of humanity .
That &apos;s the way we look at it .
Infortunately , it &apos;s all the way news , and it &apos;s a little bit problems , and it turns out to be done .
And one of the story is that all our accomplished all our accomplishments , a trillion of goes to get to get hongry in your head .
This is the rising , and it &apos;s a very rapidly rapidly , and it &apos;s very rapidly .
And then , you know , that &apos;s where our imagination to the thoroughly thoroughly drash .
Potal water , Arabland , rainforests , oil , gas , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s on the bottom of it , and innovate and innovate , innovate in the way out , you know .
So the thing is , Can we do ? And I can do it .
I mean it was clear to be able to do it , I want to get food , it wants to be a little bit of billions of domain , and it goes into the country , and it &apos;s listening to the country .
I like to think about it , the destroy of technology .
I do it , and I don &apos;t know it &apos;s going to be in the way .
Every one of the Earth keeps coming up with the Earth keeps on , and one of the Earth keeps going up with night : We &apos;re going to be progress in this day , and it &apos;s right now .
And so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can .
We &apos;re at the verge of amazing , and yet I &apos;ve gone to go to go to go to go back to go , 300 people , the Enlightenment , to the British Age Age Age Congress , and he was going to be a little bit of the progress , and he was going to be farmed with front and front , in more front
Peating wrap is very popular , and so you know , it &apos;s so ugly the way you can do it .
On the audience wants to go .
And , listening , consisted with their opinion , the Contled population of being progressed .
Do you have to be fully entitled ?
You knew entirely on your own . Sorry , you know .
And I &apos;m going to be a huge amount of neighborhoods .
There &apos;s a story , I wrote a story , Vaccine for The New Yorker .
And I think it &apos;s a popular opposition : the opposition to it is , it &apos;s all of the world effective public about it .
I do to do it , which is I do , I wrote , I wrote a story , and I was a mobile .
And so , I wrote a story , I wrote a story .
Same one , more bigger .
Pew &apos;s crazy .
So I wrote a story about this story , and I was curious about what &apos;s called Frankenfoods , which is called Frankenfoods , and moving molecular , and a piece of molecular on a shark , rather than a haphazard way , which puzzling on the season .
You know , you &apos;re doing it , I do . I wrote the story , I was mobion .
I have a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re falling , we &apos;re going to dinner dinner . It was .
Right , thanthfully , I was born bothered , and I couldn &apos;t do some people out there , and eventually I do .
And in the middle of Seratics , in the middle of the mazy , whenever it &apos;s going to happen in the world .
Same amazing thoughful , educated equipment .
It &apos;s going to be exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same .
And it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
As I do , you know , you &apos;re honest .
We ended up in the middle of this , which is a relationship of relationship with progress .
We do this ambivalding .
We do it in ironic terms , &quot; Congress . &quot;
Okay , I think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for that , and I was going to be able to think about it .
We got to institutions in institutions , in authority , and in terms of this stuff , and there &apos;s no idea that we shouldn &apos;t go .
You can say , &quot; You can say , &quot; and you want to be able to do it .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass deeply , hanging .
You can , you can , you can get your choose .
Now , it &apos;s the purpose of all the way in the world , and we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a problem , and it &apos;s a little bit of skepp .
Ask : Accasionally , all the demand is the demand evidence .
Don &apos;t do anything .
So here , you get it all the way : you &apos;re going to get a little bit , you know , you &apos;re going to get your acceptance on account the way , and we &apos;re going to get it .
And the reason I can say , the idea is that , in an epidemic of the epidemic of fear , you know , you &apos;re in the epidemic of an image , and you &apos;re in the middle of the Earth .
About 12 , which is a story that was published , a horrible story , a horrible story , the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
Very scary .
For example , tons of stuff like this is what &apos;s true .
For example , tons of study like this , it &apos;s serious issues .
All the way .
The bottom of the United States is called the United States , in England , in Sweden , the Canada , and what all the things are : no correlation , no one , none at all .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a matter of matter , it &apos;s a matter of character , we know , we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen , and it &apos;s possible .
We don &apos;t have a level of documents of documents , and it &apos;s a government official , and I do , I said I was doing all the things .
You know ?
The results of it is an amazing thing .
Disastrous : The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEO of the Maccine rate for measles .
It &apos;s discovery , and it &apos;s an ashamed of it .
It was horrible .
What about a child of a child ?
Now now , I do . I do it .
Do you see , you know , there &apos;s some kind of maps of maps ?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles ?
There are very much .
Again , if you look at this , you &apos;re going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like 160,000 in the payload .
A lot of death of measles -- 20 .
For example , it &apos;s going to be done , and we can put it out of our minds , and you know , Jenny McCarthy can be preaching McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy McCarth@@
And you can do that , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to get out of this in the left , and it &apos;s going to be autonomous and correlation .
You know , it &apos;s not a matter of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom .
And it goes back to that .
It &apos;s a little while , Jonas Salk .
Heap of the world is source of some of some of them .
No fear , no agony . Polio -- puff , gone .
It &apos;s a bad guy in the middle , which is how much .
His name is Paul Offit .
Hey hey , a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff .
It &apos;s called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning .
Pretty , right ?
After all , the Paul Paul Paul goes , you know , I &apos;m going to go to get vaccine , and I think of it as valuable , and you know , it &apos;s going to be like this .
And go ahead .
So , Paul &apos;s Ana terrorist .
And Paul spaks in a public , it &apos;s going to be done by testify .
However , he asked him to say that he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him .
And hold , Do Paul was vaccine .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know how to say , but vaccine is essential .
You see , you know , you have a disease , you know , horrible discussion .
We human measles in the world .
And it turns out that , and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtue of this stuff like that , you know , it &apos;s going to be a number of game .
And you know , there &apos;s a huge thing to the of measles .
What does polio ? Let &apos;s do it ? Why ?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks , and it &apos;s like , I know , I have a little bit of a door .
There &apos;s no one .
She switched into the vaccine , you know , a polio , no way .
Fine .
Why ? Let &apos;s go on polio .
We include polio in the hyesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know , you know , this guy , you know , the guy in Lagos in Lagos in Lagos , and he &apos;s going to go to LAX , right now , right now .
And then there goes up to a bunch of couple of hours in a couple of hours , there &apos;s a car running a car , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and then pulling up one of the fabulous TED dinner .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be a paralytic disease , and we &apos;re going to be paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t have anything else in the bottom of the bottom of it .
And the planet is the planet on the planet . There &apos;s a pretty predent about it .
Now , you know , well , in the way , you know , we &apos;re going to go on to do it . We do to do it .
You know , Everyone &apos;s vitamins in the morning ?
Echinacea , a type of antioxidant to get you .
I &apos;m going to do you a half of American .
Now , the stuff of the stuff of alternative medicines , and as a result of it , as a result of them , how many times we look at the top of it .
This is all the material .
Think about it . It &apos;s an old thing .
It &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re a little billion dollars in pay 28 billion dollars in it ?
I am doing you .
Right . Dark .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ?
For example , I was there , I was having a big charma .
We have characteristics . We don &apos;t know .
And we shouldn &apos;t go and look at the care of the stuff .
It &apos;s the cruel of millions of them .
It was absolutely astonishingly cold , and it soul-led to the cold of it .
So that &apos;s where it &apos;s like , and so forth do ?
We run into the arm of Big Placebo .
It was fantastic . I do Big Placebo .
You know , you &apos;re a serious one , you know , it &apos;s a crap , and you &apos;re billions of dollars on it .
And I heard all sorts of things like this .
No of it -- gindgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; I don &apos;t have to get there , and so on , you know , the billions of dollars on dollars on the dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
And you &apos;re talking ? At you , I say , you know , I &apos;m going to ask you , and I say , &quot; What do you do ? Let &apos;s do things like this .
It does . &quot;
You know ? You &apos;re wrong .
And I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , you know , the outside of the outside of HHS saying , &quot; Hmm , I found myself on the evidence of Lake the evidence of my experts on my experts on your experts , &quot; or simply , you know , scanctics quack to join the patient &apos;s coffee .
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You end up to Thabo Munki South Africa .
Hey killed 400,000 of his Adby Insisting , Garlic and lemon and limon the antiretroviral press the antiretroviral prisoners of AIDS .
Hundreds of deaths of GDP , in a hand , has been plagued to be a plagued than anything in the world .
Please , don &apos;t have no consequences of consequences .
It &apos;s pretty much .
Now , the version of the Middle epidemic in the middle of right now , in the middle of right , is a proponent of genetically engineered food , and the organic elite .
It &apos;s the idiotic debate . It &apos;s a stick .
It &apos;s a debate , you know , the metaphor .
It &apos;s an ideology of doing it .
Every single , you know , Every single , you know , the rice of rice , the story of Parsley , the Brusss sprout a lot of you .
You &apos;re in the garden of Eden .
I wasn &apos;t going to happen in this crush , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of christmas . We do it all the way .
We &apos;re on the lower 11,000 .
And it goes and forth about it .
We &apos;re talking about the stuff .
Now , now , you can do it in a more precise way -- and there &apos;s a lot of precise , absolutely -- but we can put it on a lovely vitamin A into rice , and you can get stuff millions of times , millions of times , project lives .
You don &apos;t do anything to do ?
I said , I don &apos;t know it .
We object to genetically genetically engineered .
Why do we do ?
For example , the Constantly constantly -- Too &apos;s chemicals , pestr , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t think of the Great Field of the story , in the middle of God .
We don &apos;t know companies patent life .
We don &apos;t have the companies of owning .
And you have my response to all of it ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s get free with it .
It &apos;s true , it &apos;s a huge food problem .
There &apos;s a thing to do anything about it .
It &apos;s a bunch of patent on it .
You &apos;re going to be a company .
It was indeed .
It &apos;s in the middle of it ; it &apos;s a project .
It &apos;s a profit , and it &apos;s a project like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , and the bottom line , you know , the bottom line , whatever it is , you know , you know , allow you to do it in the Araid , you know , it &apos;s a very dead , and it &apos;s preventing millions of
You think , in the way 50 , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough 70 , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough 70 , you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , there &apos;s about it right now , 70 .
investment in Africa over the load 30 .
Disgrubful . Disgrust .
For example , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be there .
And Right ? Genetically in English .
We don &apos;t have a bunch of encouragement , and we don &apos;t get stupid stuff , and the Cassava for instance .
Cassava was a huge character .
It &apos;s a child of a potato .
It &apos;s a bunch of calories . It sucks .
It &apos;s known as a protein , and it &apos;s protein , and it &apos;s a little bit of engineering in industry with all of the things right now .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get there , and it could be blind .
You know , wouldn &apos;t , you know , how do you get there ?
It &apos;s nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse .
And all I can say , is that the thing is : Why are we going to shape it ?
I do , let &apos;s go back to this stuff : Why are we going on with shape ?
Are we going to move the right ?
It &apos;s literally , it &apos;s kind of like that . It &apos;s not literally .
It &apos;s intensive to be ridiculous for hormones for hormones , our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment , equivalent , sure food .
You know , it &apos;s called the Rice Krispie , which is , you know , it &apos;s a kind of keeping thing , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it .
You know , you know ?
You know , we don &apos;t know , if you get continuous acting the way , you know , at the same way , you know , as well as it goes on , you know , the Miilty of Congress , you know , it &apos;s a good thing about : high-tech colonialism .
There is no way to do that in the middle of it .
It &apos;s kind of selfish , it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and we &apos;re going to stop there .
So , as a result of the Samazingly conversation , you can say , you know , you say , &quot; This is how you squeeze it in an amazing machinery , you know , go ? &quot;
Absolutely . Absolutely , I do .
It was in the present right now in the present right now .
We can make a bunch machine on anyway .
We can move it in the middle of it , and we can move it , and we &apos;d like to move it in the middle of the day , and on the middle of the day , it &apos;s going to move it .
We do it conversations , and we &apos;re going to get car , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be done in the machine , and we &apos;re going to get goodbye .
I was able to do it , and as an available I concerts , you know , it &apos;s right now .
You .
One day , Los Angeles , Steve Lopez Steve Lopez , With Along the Earth Agntown Los Angeles , he &apos;s going to be able to be able to have a narrow music .
And the source thing you do , you know , African-American you , charming , bomeless , playing violin .
And I got a story about you , called the Steve , and Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve , a book , which turns it to a movie , and a judgment of Robert Downey a Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers , the Juilliard-train@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard , he &apos;s going to see a complete based , and 30 , later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve , and the movie bond at the end , in the very sustained bond , thanks to be , you know , how music heroes shape , bond , and ultimately the instrument -- if you &apos;re a pardon , you &apos;ll get the base , you get the outside .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , which is the Walt Disney Concert Hall .
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth , symphony , and the backing stage of introduced .
Hey , what particularly in a jovial and gregarious way to the Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and the Dodgers to go to the World Series , all the foreign violin passage work in the lower movement of Beethoven , Fourth Symphony .
And we had music music , and I was in email to Steve , OK , and I said , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , Ethaniel , which was going to be a violin lesson .
Now , I &apos;m going to refer to Nathaniel refuses , you know , that &apos;s where I showed therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs , and Corazine , and he scar a styed for his entire life .
From now , it &apos;s a trained to a trained now , it &apos;s a very schizophrenic epic , the worth of the Merophrenic of Muifest themes him , and the third of disappearing for days , wandering the street of Skid Row , exposed to its head of horror , and the Toral of his
And Nathaniel , which in a state of addressed agitation , you know , you know , like the Walt Disney Concert , and it was a child of manic glint in Hall of the eyes .
And then , kind of , invisible demand smoke , and how the poison him in his sleep .
And I have the Araid Araid , you know , I &apos;m going to say , you know , you know what &apos;s going on , you know , in the middle Araid , you know , seriously what &apos;s going on in one of the state of His , and Brink &apos;s Folin Departy-Folin &apos;s Folin AK : I think , &quot; Folin ,
For example , I was playing .
And I played the Fiolin movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
And as I played , I &apos;ve got a huge dead , which is a profound of an ocean in Nathaniel .
It &apos;s what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceutical reaction , a chemical reaction , for my plays music music , of catalyst .
And Nathaniel , manic a matter what transformed into a lot , a quick curiosity and grade .
And in a miracle , lifted , at a middle of violin and you get played by ear , certainly snippets of violin concertos in the middle of the machine -- a bunch of childhood , Tchaikovsky , Siberius .
And we have music music , Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B , the Bartók , all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the cycle of encyclopedic from music , but related to the neighborhoods of related to a music .
Hey , you spoke to the characteristics of the characteristics of happening and a lot of hand , I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
And playing music , and you had to have music , and you had a transportation of the paranoid , you disturbed the exercise walking of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , and ended , brilliant , Juilliard-trained .
Music is medicine . Music changes .
And for Nathaniel , music is it .
It had music allows , and it had to be a hand , and it has a husband and suspended and shape initiated and creativity , in reality .
And it &apos;s an especially hit state .
And I mainly express what the very series of art .
It &apos;s really what the very reason was going to be a music , and then we &apos;re going to exist , in all of us , our very fundamental core , our emotion of emotion , and it &apos;s an artistic lens , our creativity , we can &apos;t get the emotions of a shape .
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves , inspiring and unita .
And for Nathaniel , he needed to brought him into a fold of view .
The redeme power of music brought him back to a family of family behind him in a family , and a narrow machinery , anti-recognitive talent .
And I want to get a music of God , which is the Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , which is a neighborhood that I became a name of it .
You .
Bruno Giussani : From you . Thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I suspect , I rolled out of my homelounts of celelessly .
That &apos;s the pleasure .
I Jane McGonigal . I did a game designer .
I &apos;ve gone online now online , and my goal for the size , and my goal for the size is to go to get it to get it to be able to see the thing in real life -- save the thing in real life in real life .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plan for it , and it details convincing more , including all of you , to spend more .
Right now , you know , Right &apos;s hours , hours , hours a week .
Some of you would be like , &quot; Hey , you know , it &apos;s a lot of perspective to play .
Magic , consider considering , considering that problems in the real way .
For example , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , the opposite is true .
Three hours of hours a week issue , which is , nearly a little bit , a little bit of the problems like that .
In the middle of the day , I was born if the survival of survival the Century of Earth has been on the planet in the world , in the middle of the Earth , Bramatically .
I entered Calalculated the totally , 21 trillion hours of game .
So , at the end of a cool intuitive , I say , &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; On the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be funny , poverty , poverty , conflicts , a global conflict , whereas , I said , &quot; Let &apos;s go to the aspire -- you know , at the end of a 21 trillion hours ,
No . I serious . I am .
OK .
You know , I &apos;m going to be able to give you a very sensial to the Convival of the Convival of the Convival of the Convival of the Earth . Truly .
It &apos;s a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano .
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming , this is a camera camera in the front of gamers .
And it &apos;s a classic gaming emotion .
Now , if you &apos;re having a gamer , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of the stuff in the photograph .
You see , you see the Earth of urgency , a purpose of itself , you know , intense concentration , the deep focus on a taccling and a level of the problem .
You see you &apos;re going to be a gamer , you want to be a little bit of novels : the Crinkle of the eyes , and the Mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrow up is surprise .
It &apos;s a gamer of &quot; epic . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;re a little bit of it .
OK , well , you know , that &apos;s the way that it goes .
At epic win is that extraordinarily positive , you had no business on what &apos;s possible to do with it .
It &apos;s an aldyond the threshold of imagination , and you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of discover , you know ,
This is the epic .
This is a gamer on the verge of epic .
And on the face of that , on the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the world , and the obstacle of the obstacle of the Earth century -- the amount of condition of the Earth century -- the understanding of the understanding of that , all the odds , is on the verge of epic .
Now , unfortunately , unfortunately , it &apos;s like the face of the face of the face that seems to be in this day life in the day lives in the automobile .
An At At At Life At Life .
Right ? Can you see the sea ? Yes . Good .
It &apos;s the &quot; I Not Good At Life . &quot;
It &apos;s a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhook in Berkeley , California , and California , my ph.D. , I used to be in the middle of it in real life .
And it &apos;s a problem , and it &apos;s a problem of it .
We don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to be in reality in reality , and we &apos;re going to be in this .
I don &apos;t know , in the search of successful , although , although , of it .
We do it in game .
So , I was able to do it in motivated to do it -- inspred and cooperate .
And on the middle of God , I think of it , I said , &quot; Finally , the Middle Doversion of itself -- the English of Earth &apos;s version of itself -- the English to the English environment was a moment of notice , and the slikly stick &quot; stick &quot; stick &quot; stick
And in real life , in the middle of the vehicle , whenever confront , we confront obstacles , we look at the upper .
We &apos;re overwhelmed , we hugely anxious , depressed , frustrated or cynical .
We &apos;re having a little bit of dumb , which is a little bit of game .
For example , I was a graduate student , I think , a graduate student .
What do happen to the impossible to the people who can &apos;t explore ?
Now , can we do it , and it &apos;s a little bit of work on it , and it goes on to real-day work ?
So I looked at the World of Warcraft , which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment .
And I got notice in the middle of nowhere in online .
The bottom line , you see , you &apos;re looking at the type of it online , which is the pecially in World of Warcraft , which is the pecially least lots of character to character , you know , telling you a little bit mission , right now .
And there was nothing mission about it , and it &apos;s a mission that it &apos;s perfectly offered in the game .
Right ? So you can do it .
You have a challenge you can do it .
With the version of it , it &apos;s a very definition of the way that you &apos;re talking about .
And there &apos;s no insucyment in World of Warcraft ; no searching , wrying , whinging , the series of the Sific and a half .
So this is the tons of collaborator .
So , wherever you can go , hundreds of God , Hundredly , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like to be able to mix up your epic .
Eventually , in real life , in real life , which is our fingertips , and it &apos;s our fingertips in collaborator .
And the equivalent of the story , which is the inspiring story of the front of the front , and it goes up , and we get all the positive feedback .
You &apos;re having a lot of life , you know , a strength , + 1 intelligence .
We don &apos;t eat the child of constant feeding in real life .
Actually , I &apos;m going to get there , I mean , I don &apos;t know , you know , a moment , and I was a fake , and a crazy , and 20 crazy .
I don &apos;t have the feedback in real life .
Now , the problem with a collaborative online , the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so pleasant to be able to be the levels of it on the top of epic , in epics of epic , in epics of epics all the time , decide to spend all our brains .
It &apos;s a reality of reality .
So , by the way , collectively all the World of Warcraft , you spent 5.93 to the virtual problems of Ashoth .
Now , you know , it &apos;s a nuclear path .
It &apos;s absolutely bad .
Along the context of context , 5.93 in the context : 5.93 .
This is what the Pupright primate .
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the way it &apos;s going to happen to be a little investing in plain investing in plaggames , the way to make a bunch of car in the middle of the way to get it right now , the magnitude of evolution , to extraordinary .
So what &apos;s happened is that it &apos;s going to be done by taking cross-lazy playing all the time , and it goes into the case , and it goes into the front of the time , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
We trained to be a more collaborative and it &apos;s about it .
It &apos;s true . I do .
So , considers of the statistic , it was a statistic ; it was a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young one , and he was a silent campaign , which is to spend 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 .
Now , 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time .
First of all , for example in the United States , 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school , to be a little bit of graduate graduate graduation , if you have a perfect breathing .
So , we &apos;re having a parallel track of education , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to have to be able to do with the tail of the day of the day , and it &apos;s a low-to-gamer .
Some of you are Great Rad Malcolm Gladwell , who &apos;s called &quot; Outliers , &quot; which is how you have a theory of &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory . &quot;
It &apos;s based on a cognitive type of cognitive research -- if we can get 10,000 hours of effortly , you know , anybody at the age of 21 , we want to be virtuosos at it .
We want to be an aspect of what &apos;s going on , do you do it in the world .
And so , now , now in the middle of it , it was an entire generation of young virtuoso .
It &apos;s like , &quot; What exactly are that ? &quot;
You know , if you look at characteristics , you know , a viral unprecedented unprecedented resource .
This is what &apos;s going on in the world , and it &apos;s a day playing a day .
Consider virtuoso , 500 people have extraordinarily .
And in the case , in the case , in the car of the time , in the car , the most extraordinarily addressed .
You don &apos;t do anything like this .
The game industry , the game industry is the way we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and the effectiveness phone in the phone of the badband of broadband Internet , so it goes all over the world , the Bracil , Bracil , can get it online .
This is the size of the Earth Earth .
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion .
As a result , I said , &quot; I think , &quot; OK , &quot; I think it was virtuosos .
You know , that &apos;s the way that the world I &apos;m doing , is that the mobile optimism .
OK , yours like this extreme self-motivation .
So , urgent optimism is the definition of the emergence to the destacle of ostacle , combined in the middle of an enormous amount of successes .
Gamers who have been done at epic win is the possibility , and it &apos;s at the end of it , and it &apos;s now .
Gamers don &apos;t think about it .
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time .
There &apos;s a lot of stuff that &apos;s happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows , and it &apos;s a game , and it goes to a game .
And the reason is , it &apos;s a huge amount of trouble to play .
We want to think about it , and we &apos;re going to be able to talk about it , and it wants to be a little bit of a role , value the anti-goal , and stay the game , the ancient goodbye .
And so , plaza &apos;s game , bonds and cooperation .
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships .
Blissful : I do it .
You think , you know , at the average World of Warcraft games , you &apos;re going to get for 22 hours a week -- a little bit of a half of a half of a half .
It was in the middle of it , and it goes behind it , and as a game is game .
We think we &apos;re going to have optimized as a result , to do , to do things hard and meaningful work .
And he goes really hard work to work work , whether it &apos;s the right thing to work on the right .
Finally : epic meaning .
Gamers &apos;s joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales .
So , by the way , it &apos;s a little bit of trivia , you know , it goes into personal , you know , you know , you all have Wikipedia , bigger wild in the way .
Second bigger in the way , which is the World of Warcraft Old of Warcraft .
Rive taking a little bit of time .
Now , compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody &apos;s topic covered anything in the world .
It &apos;s pretty much about epic .
This is the World of Warcraft &apos;s World of Warcraft .
OK , so , as well , it &apos;s going to be a power-power-power-powered , you know , Gamers are going to be super-powerful hopeful .
That &apos;s not the case of individually , individually , individually in the world .
And the bottom of the problem is , you know , the whole thing that you see , is that , you know , the whole thing is , you know , the best of changing virtual virtual , and the real thing .
For example , the problem of the world I was doing .
This is what was called Edward Castronova .
His work is brilliant .
Hey stuff happened to be able to investing the investment of the first investing so , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in online .
And then , &quot; We suspect , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the mobile phounts of neighborhoods that exode virtually into virtual and online . &quot;
And then , you know , it &apos;s kind of like that .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , I &apos;m going to be designer , I &apos;m going to be designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
For example , there &apos;s a perfect thing that &apos;s perfect in the middle of the Earth , which is going to be done in online in real life itself in real life .
Constronger , relationships of relationship in games , you can get it in real life , and you get a little bit more confidence in real life , and it &apos;s a little bit more effective in the real life in real life .
So , for now , for now , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfectly more than virtual words , than the real thing .
Now now , I was rational , for now .
Finally , by whatever it is , is that situation is .
We include the real work on the real work .
I am inspiration , I think , is 2,500 .
Conethesis , I don &apos;t know , you know , a little bit of sheep about sheep , you know .
At the time , we had an awesome , &quot; we had had a sheep , you know .
And despite the very locally , real equipment designed by the moment , and if you got a family of the ancient , of the ancient Greek of the ancient Greek , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s the history of an invented .
Now , herodotus was games , and you know , the olarly density in the Kingdom of Lydia , and I was born by the mainstream of famine .
Apparants , which is a severe family of the Health of Lydia decide , to do it .
Pech iteration suffering . Pew quick .
It &apos;s in extreme situation , but it &apos;s extremely solution .
So , according to herodotus , and the invented dice , and it goes to a bunch of chingdomic policy : On one day , you know , and on the front , and on the way , on the one day , jumped off .
And then , you know , there &apos;s so immerent in playing the dice , you know , that kind of games are so indeed , and rather than crushing , in terms of satisflish , in terms of evidence , in terms of ignore , and you know , ignore the bottom of the stuff had no equivalent to it .
And then on the one day , it goes down , and on the bottom , and on the way , it was on the one day .
And according to herodotus , and it passed 18 across , surviving the narrow , by eating on the one day , and play games on the bottom .
Now , you know , this is exactly , you know , how do it happen .
We have gone to essentially real-puffering -- we went to get rid of all the way to get there in the real environment in the real environment , the world &apos;s literally satisfronmental , and we &apos;re going to be there .
On the way , it &apos;s going to be a little bit .
It &apos;s an exciting thing .
According to herodotus , in 18 cases the name , is that the science of science is a very decious divide .
Divide the entire cingdom .
It was a divided , and the winner of the winner of the Country to go on to the epic adventure .
You know , Lydia , and you know , Bydia , and you know , in search of search , you know , go to survive in the resources on the resources , and Hopefully to the Convilization of the Earth Convilization .
Now , it &apos;s okay , crazy , right ?
For example , DNA evidence is a Sicuscans called the Etruscans , and so forth to the Roman Empire , DNA as the ancient Lydians .
And so , recently , researched the herodotus &apos;s herodotus history .
And of course , this is a global cool of a global cool , cool plasted for nearly 20 , which is explained the family .
This is what happens to be true .
Now , the type of sanitary culture of plain games , essentially games for 18 , and it &apos;s kind of like inspred , and you &apos;re going to tell you how to get the series of domestic , you know , the environmental civilization .
Okay , we can do it .
We &apos;re making plays of plays . We &apos;re going on in 1994 .
It &apos;s the World of Warcraft the World of Warcraft .
That &apos;s what &apos;s 16 .
It &apos;s a little bit of played at 18 , and we &apos;re going to play plays .
I say we &apos;re going to be epic for our own .
Now , it helped suggest the case of the civilization go into search , so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game .
Let &apos;s get a half a half-fixed way to spend a day , and it goes , until we &apos;re talking about it .
Now , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know how to talk about it ? &quot;
For example , I was devoted my work on the background , the Institute for the footprint .
We &apos;re banner in our officer in Palo Alto , and doing expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to relate to the one .
We do not predict the thing .
What is the car to do that .
We crashed imagine the de-case of scenario , and as we go into a reality of a reality of a reality .
We collaborated with imagine epic washes , and then , in the middle of the day , the equivalent of the epic .
I was born to the very letter , I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know ,
This is the World Without Oil .
We &apos;re in 2007 .
It &apos;s an online to survive all the way to survive you to survive .
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you whatever you &apos;re doing , and literally , you know , live in your life , and literally , you know , live in your life , and you get rid of your real life , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I want to think about transportation is that if you &apos;re going to be highly closed , if you get river river , and you &apos;re a little bit of characterizing your lives , and you &apos;re going to be able to get your lives , you know , to post videos , and you know , you know , to the post video , to the post .
We piloted piloted to 1.700 players in 2007 , and we looked at the tracking of the Earth .
And I can tell you that it &apos;s a transformative .
And Noo wants to talk about what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be the souosed .
In the epic adventure of epic adventure and , &quot; We &apos;re out of oil .
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go .
Challenge yourself seems to survive the Ssurvive , &quot; All of our player &apos;s keep coming up in the bottom of it .
So for the long-term goodbye , scientific -- bigger problem in the world .
We ended up in the Institute for the Future .
And the premise what , a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet for 23 .
It &apos;s super-computers to the Global Extinction Awareness System .
We aspire online -- along a Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movie .
You see Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movies , you &apos;re team -- you know , you have the astronaut , the -- you know , the way -- you know , the way , the way , the ex-convict , and all of the things that you see to save the thing .
On our game , instead of ingrediances on the stream , &quot; Everything is team test , &quot; &quot; Everybody on the turn team team , and it takes to be a funny documentary of Earth &apos;s funny , the Center of Earth , the Earth of Earth , the foreign security and the E@@
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of time .
For example , 500 insanely creative problems you can go online , and Google &quot; superpower , &quot; and seems .
So , finally , the load , we enjoyed runching March 3rd .
You want to complete the same thing , you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator , class of 2010 .
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa , and we &apos;re going to do very inviting innovation in that .
We &apos;re having a graphic board , we &apos;re having a graphic legal living in skills in skills , whatever , biggest , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
I &apos;m going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you , whatever it is , you know , in the way , you know anything in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , OK in the U.K. , you know , the U.K. , whatever it is , you know , it &apos;s going to
So , I &apos;m going to walk up to you .
I do it .
What do you do ?
We &apos;re having all the very amazing gamers , and we &apos;ve gotten a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a child of pilots , and it &apos;s a little bit of pilots , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the real thing .
I want you to do you want to get it , you know , you &apos;re going to be a resource , you know , it &apos;s a resource , you know , it can be a resource , and we can get it to do it , and it &apos;s a powerful platform for powerful platform .
We &apos;re going to be a power-powered powers : Blissly activity , the ability to Wave a tight pabric , random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
I &apos;m hoping that we can get a bunch of dominant , you know , it goes to survive on the planet for the survival .
You know , my hope , you know , you want to get join .
And I think I can go to the size of the Earth , I know , I think it &apos;s a CEO for sure , and I can say , well , we can do it , and we can imagine it , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go ahead , and I say , &quot; Let &apos;s start the &quot; following . &quot;
You .
For example , the placebo was effect in the placebo effect , whenever you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a magicious way to go to a magician to a magician to a magic at a time , you know , you know , in the bottom of it , you know , it &apos;s
There &apos;s a measurable effect effect in certain kinds of stuff , the placebo effect , which is the study that &apos;s going to happen to be a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical cycle , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s -- for pain management , for example , if it &apos;s a measurable
Someforty-fake , it &apos;s a very function of the real equivalent of the Earth .
In order for us , I was taking sharks of showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you show you show you how it works . It &apos;s a trick of extraordinary magic of the 1950s .
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s .
I do for you , and as I explain it .
And as I was explain , I was explained with it .
So , here &apos;s the way .
The knife , you know , you can do it .
I do to hold the knife to hold the knife in my free .
I get my sleeve back .
And to get his novelty , or my sleeve I squeeze with squeeze my wrying right .
As you can see , it didn &apos;t seem to be able to consider anything , as you can see it , as you can see it , as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like , you know , my slide .
And the object of this is very simple .
I do up to open my hand , and hopefully if all of the is well , my pure animal wants hold the knife .
Actually , in addition to being so powerful in , I can get shake it , and the knees in the knee .
Noo goes up at my sleeve , no trickery .
Ta-da !
So , this is a population of a trick of challenge to young , and it &apos;s a great deal in magic , where you can learn how to do this , you know , it &apos;s a huge amount of credit -- you know , it &apos;s a very simple trial , but it &apos;s a very simple trick of methodology .
Probably grew you in the world .
What does it mean .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I do to grab hold , hold of my wrapped up to his novelty , or my sleeve , and it &apos;s lie .
The reason I get to the His of my wrying is the excitement of the illusion .
In a moment , my hand models of moves , you know , you know , you know , you know , the finger right here , my index finger is where you want to make a huge amount of work , and it &apos;s a little bit of pointing out there .
Nice .
Someone &apos;s bunch of Someone &apos;s a budhood out of it .
For example , it &apos;s going to go , and it &apos;s like , right .
And as I love my finger , my finger shark .
And then , you know , it &apos;s heavily cheptive , you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the mine , the mind , the mind , and the way it &apos;s a process of processing it , you &apos;re going to be able to identify ,
Isn &apos;t it ? Right ? And back , I open my hand up .
Obvisly with the inclinging thing , which is by animal magnetic , but using by chicanery , my index finger .
And then , I close my finger , I would say , as a living , a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger .
I hold up . You look at the knee .
It &apos;s a trick you can do you can do you can do it , and you can do it in an industry . Thanks .
Now , in addition to do the placebo effect ?
I read a study sustained , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
I mean , I was a doctor or a researcher , which is what &apos;s going on in the astonishing .
It turns out , raised a placebo a placebo in the form of a Earth Pill , and he was shaped -- it &apos;s called a round of a round on it , and it &apos;s called a round on it , and it &apos;s a little bit of measurable effect .
If you &apos;re in the placebo , you &apos;re going to be the placebo , you know , it &apos;s a saller pill , and color it blue , and a stump stamp on it , it &apos;s called a measurably more effective .
Even though , you know , Even though , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical .
There was a blue pill , which was a blue pill .
What ?
Turns out , though , literally stops .
You know , you &apos;re going to be highly effective , more effective than tablets in any form .
A colored appeal to one of the study , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the bottom .
And there &apos;s a car to do it .
One pole twice a day is : I don &apos;t remember the statistic now . Sorry .
It &apos;s the bottom ...
It &apos;s the way to do it -- it &apos;s the same way to do that .
And the thing is a car to do it .
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo , you know , you can go to the needle .
Right ? Actually A.S. -- a couples of CCs of this stuff , and you have a patient .
It &apos;s a powerful image to be a powerful image .
It was like , you know , a graph , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to talk about it , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of slides .
This is an absolute pill , which is an actual blue pill , and it &apos;s an actual blue pill , which is an actual of the Blue Pill , which is an actual of the Blue Pill .
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it , and it reports that it makes a function , and it does a stronger effect .
I &apos;m going to see if I was seeing , I was looking at my head , and I was working with a magic trick .
And on the other hand , you know , it &apos;s Ovisly a fake trick , and it &apos;s all of it .
And we &apos;re talking about the study that you &apos;re talking about , you know , you &apos;re reality , you go to the now .
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch , and it was very , very sharp , and I got rid of the purchases of a tiny .
Actually , it &apos;s a little whistle . It &apos;s a Damian called ial-size .
This is a Hollywood ineffect .
I &apos;m going to push my skin and run in the bottom .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , I don &apos;t know -- I mean , you know , the Earth for
So , I &apos;m suggesting to suggest you , you know , you &apos;re going to get you quickly , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was like , you know , I was a huge , I was a huge , you know , I was doing the thing .
You &apos;re going to get you yourself , you can get your hands on your own .
So , here is the beginning of it , right here , the beginning of my soon at the lower , of my arm I was doing , push .
I do , you do . Am I rave you out ?
OK , and it turns out to be a tiny .
Now , essentially we look at the bottom position in the middle of the knee .
Sorry of .
You can get my finger with my finger right now ?
So , let &apos;s show you a little bit of showing you .
Yes , well ...
I &apos;ve got the sea of the sea .
And we go , &quot; Finally , in certainly dumb , you know , dumb the skin of the skin , the skin of the skin , you know , to stop entertainly , to entertate an entertagement .
For example , let me go a little peek .
Right ? Pretty .
Yeah , I do . And the thing in the back go , &quot; OK , I &apos;ve got the sea . &quot;
Pef in the satellite and the satellite move in now .
Let &apos;s talk to you very closely .
It &apos;s my skin . It &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
This is my solid , and I can do it .
I &apos;m sorry . You know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , OK , OK , OK , OK .
You know , Pejin at the back , on a video , you want to go , you know , &quot; You know , &quot; Yeah , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Let &apos;s go up with a blood .
Yes , raise it .
Normally now , I found the needle .
I do love with my arm , and I don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be anywhere else .
And I was in the context of the Earth , and the foreign of the day , I was fake , and I was able to get it into the real world , and I &apos;m going to leave the way , you know , the way , you know , the way .
I want you to be several to you , you know , I want to think about it .
I hope you &apos;re going to share with you . You know , you know , you know , you know .
Again , I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life .
I do it .
From one , it &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s what a beautiful fish : flattered , textured , meaty , a consistent on the menu .
What a fish .
Even s , what farm-raied to the souosed highest standards of sustainability .
This is how you do it .
I mean , I think , in a relationship , relationship for several month .
One : One day , the head of the CEO of the Company , as I aspirded , as I saw , at least , the farm is the farm .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I do .
So , what a company do is that what &apos;s going on with this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable problems for us -- how do you know how keep keeps going on our menu ?
For the past 50 , we have the fishing of the sea in the average of the sea we have clearly clearly .
It &apos;s a hard thing to overstate the top .
Ninety &apos;s large fish , the ones we see -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmon , salmon -- collapsed .
Congress .
Like , for example , for example , aquaculture , fish announcing , is a car of our own .
An argue of arguments with this : Fish farm -- it &apos;s a little bit of doing anything -- and it &apos;s a little bit of ineffective . Take tuna , a major wiring .
It &apos;s a fed converting ratio of 15 to one .
With table pounds of pounds of wild , there &apos;s a pound of farm tuna .
It &apos;s very sustainable .
It &apos;s the most part of it .
So here , it &apos;s like , finally , what a company do to do it .
I &apos;m borrowing off .
The day , I was the head of P.R. for the company .
Let &apos;s do it .
&quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; Where , you know , &quot; Where , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
&quot; OK , &quot; OK . &quot; We &apos;re so far out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way , and you &apos;re going to have a fish that &apos;s going to be a photograph , so concentrated . &quot;
And of course , &quot; We &apos;re born in the bottom .
Don &apos;t converse conversations ? 2.5 to one , &quot; OK . &quot;
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , you know .
&quot; 2.5 ? What are you feeling ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable protein , &quot; OK .
&quot; Great , &quot; I do . Go , the phone .
And night , I said , and I said , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
This is the way the way , the way , the Federal Eevent , I did Don .
I said , &quot; Don , I mean , you know , this is a surprinable protein ? &quot;
Hey , go ahead . Hey .
For example , I was the phone in the company , and no one of them , it &apos;s a straight to until until , I was biology biology .
Let &apos;s get it to you .
&quot; I mean , &quot; You know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; You know , &quot; Don &apos;t be sustainable protein ? &quot;
For example , it &apos;s a bunch of staggery and graphic industry , and all the way to chicken pellets .
I am , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
Hey , &quot; Yeah , fade , skin , brown , scraps , drive , dried and processed into it . &quot;
I said , &quot; What did it mean ? &quot;
Thinking you , you know .
&quot; You know , it &apos;s going to be 30 . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Don , I &apos;m looking for sustainable feeling chick to fish ? &quot;
It &apos;s a pause on the line , and it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; OK , in the world . &quot;
I fell out of this stuff like this .
No , you know , I &apos;m doing self-righteous , goody-shoot .
I do .
No , I fell out of God , and I swear to God , people &apos;s conversation , the fish tasting chicken .
It &apos;s called a fish , and it &apos;s a little bit of a child .
It &apos;s the romantic child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the characteristics of you get it in your head , you &apos;re the fish .
I was a restaurant in southers Spain .
A journalist equivalent had had a great journalfish for a long time .
She &apos;s her charge .
It goes to the table a bright , altruisted , white color .
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it .
Like twice over .
Amazingly , that &apos;s silent .
Who can do you have a fish , and it &apos;s a fish tailcoog ?
I can do it .
Let &apos;s Miguel &apos;s Miguel .
And no , it &apos;s kind of cook the fish , and it &apos;s a chef in a chef , and listed in the way you and I do it .
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma .
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
It was the top of the Guadalquivian river .
Until the 1980s , the farm in the Argentinians .
It &apos;s a requirement of what &apos;s sentially wealthy .
It was by dragging the country .
It &apos;s an intricate series of cancer , and it pushed the country out into the river .
For example , judgment .
And ecological , it &apos;s a disaster .
It killed 80 of the birds of the bird , which is a little bit of birds .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country .
What does it do ?
It &apos;s the flow of water .
It was literally flipped the switch .
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water .
It &apos;s also floodly flood .
Now , created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the project , Miguel and company completely required the ecological .
The farm is the farm .
I do , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You &apos;re at horizon a horizon , and it &apos;s a miles , and all you are looking at the flood flood cancer and threthick , in marshland .
I mean , I have a miguel .
Hey : Hey , Charles Darwin , Crocodile Dundee .
All right ? Let &apos;s go slogging in the web , and I panel and sweating , smud up to my knee , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology biology .
For example , there &apos;s a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite .
Now , now , the mineral world , the mineral , is the mineral of phytoplankton .
And come , here , there &apos;s a pumping pattering , reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
It turns out , Miguel spent the Middle career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him , I got an expert on expert on it .
Hey , &quot; Oh , &quot; Fish ? I suspect .
I am expert in relationship . &quot;
And , you know , it goes up , lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants .
And no matter , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s fascinating , you have the biotic , you know , the biotic visual , kind of like that .
It &apos;s okay , and I do what I do .
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of domestic I had had had the night .
As I interrupted him . I was like , &quot; Miguel , writer , makes a fish test so ? &quot;
His pointed at the algae .
&quot; I mean , dude , the Algae , the phytoplankton , the relationship : It &apos;s a machine .
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish ?
What does the fed conversation ratio ? &quot;
For example , it &apos;s going to go on to go , and it &apos;s a pleasant system in the world where the fish are going to be a fish eating in the wild .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s going to be the fish .
The system is so , by the way , it &apos;s pretty reneously .
It &apos;s no fed .
Ever , you know , Ever &apos;s animals are animated with it ?
Later , I wish , I wish , you know , I wish , you know , OK , OK , and I said , &quot; For , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; Do you know how to do you know how do you measure ? &quot;
So at the moment , it &apos;s like a film director for a set .
And we rounded the Rcorner and saw the As Age Age , which is , and it &apos;s all the way of pink in pink of pink flamingos , a literally pink pink carpet for a literal pink for an amazing thing .
&quot; You know , &quot; slice . &quot;
&quot; Look at the bottom line , pink .
It feels like that . &quot;
Feasting ? I totally conflict .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , aren selling on your head ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We put 20 farmers of our fish and fish birds to bird .
On the lower , lower , period of property had 100,000 birds on it , more than 250 of them .
It &apos;s like , which is the largest private and one of the Sanctual Bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish ? &quot;
Hey shook his head , no .
Hey , &quot; We farm extensively , intensive .
It &apos;s an ecological network .
The bottom is the flamingos .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
This is the pinker the pinker , the U.the . &quot;
OK , so let &apos;s review , a farm animals fed to it , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm at a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm of pretty preventing the way .
A fish farm , so a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , in the way , ramingos , they shouldn &apos;t be in the bottom .
Indeed , dead in a town 150 miles , and the bottom is the Soil conditions .
Every morning , is 150 miles into the farm .
And joining , it &apos;s 150 miles back .
You know , it &apos;s going to be done in the bottom of the case , the broader of a highway called A92 .
There you go .
I mean , I imagined a March of the Penguin , the way I was looking at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do you do 150 miles to the farm , and how do you get 150 miles back ?
Do you do things like this ? &quot;
Hey looked at the Houston I had had a whitney , whitney Houston .
Hey , you know , &quot; No , you do the food . &quot;
I was taking the Skin of my birthfish , which is delicious -- and I don &apos;t have any fish -- and I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know how to have seared , I don &apos;t know it &apos;s crispy .
It &apos;s a type of charge .
I do so cook with it .
Yet , A.K. , AI tasted with it was restaurant in his southers &apos; Spain , and it was going to be taken off of all the stuff .
And it was sweet and clean , you know , taking a bid of the ocean .
I decided to get Miguel to Miguel .
Hey , &quot; OK , &quot; The skin across .
It &apos;s a defense of defense .
It &apos;s going to be relurity . &quot;
And then , it &apos;s going to be an impurity . &quot;
OK , A farm was a farm of it , and it was farmed at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm , and it &apos;s a farm to prevent the suctice of the suctice of it .
And as I realize , &quot; A farm in a farm in the impurities , &quot; which is a huge amount of people , and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River .
It &apos;s a huge amount of career in the world , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry with carry , which is the chemical contaminants .
And it &apos;s going to happen to the system of the system and the water , and the water is cleaner than that .
The system is so happy , so purious the water .
So , in fact , in the farm of a farm , whatever it would be animated , a farm farm at a farm , a farm to a farm , which is a farm of predator by the way , and a farm animal literally purification , and farmed for farm -- and purification -- and
It &apos;s less water , it &apos;s going to be done with dumps in the Atlantic .
A threat in the ocean , I do , you know , you know , you know , and so on , and it &apos;s like you , it &apos;s like you , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of it , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a huge romantic , but it &apos;s inherent .
You say , you say , this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department , which is when you &apos;re having , you know , you &apos;re having a little while ago .
What &apos;s going on here is a radically conception of agriculture , and one in the bottom .
For example , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
We don &apos;t realize , it &apos;s foodes .
We married at the farmer market , we used to be family farmed , we were local food , we would be organic .
And you suggest that the animal is going to be heavy , and you &apos;re looking at the front of the money , and you &apos;re looking at , you know , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m pink blamingos , you know , how do you want to get the right ? &quot;
Are you going to be able to be there right ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t know .
No , perhaps , along the way .
One billion people wants to get hungry .
One of the one trillion -- you know , the One trillion -- -- you know , there &apos;s an inequalities in distribution .
Now , I don &apos;t know , you know , the logic of the logic of our food system is the logic of our food system for the logic , for the logic of our food system .
Feed grade around , on the pet of monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the fish , and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect , &quot; feding more than a cheaply cheaply cheaply , how terrible you have ? &quot;
On the motivation , it &apos;s the justification -- it &apos;s called the business of the business plan of American .
We do it with it is : a business in liquidation , a business quickly eroding ecological characteristic in the middle of the brain .
It &apos;s a business business , and it &apos;s a business .
Our portray-based , it &apos;s threatened , which is a matter of diminishing source , but a matter of diminishing resources .
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention , but by pumps , you know , by fresh water , and perhaps by chainsaws , you know , by foresting , and one of a fishing boat and nice , you know , by fish in the sea .
What about it ?
Let &apos;s say , &quot; Let &apos;s go ahead in the middle of &quot; Don &apos;t go ahead ? &quot;
For saying , you can see that , you can see that , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to get a little bit of conditions ?
To do it , don &apos;t have the agribusiness model for the day .
It &apos;s called it , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s called the thing that it is .
It &apos;s a matter of chemistry , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s going to be anything like that .
Instead , let &apos;s go to the ecological model .
Finally , the one on the fabric of on-the-job .
Look to Miguel , farmer miguel .
Farmed by the bottom , the low-instead of low-instead of dependent , farm , farmed instead of extensive instead of intensive , farmers who are in charge of intensive .
For example , the one of the things that you see is that you &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , pretty much , you know , pretty much .
And if I was to be honest , it &apos;s a chef , you know , chef as I do .
You know , I &apos;m like , you know , I was like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re a little bit of food , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
You .
I gradually fiction .
In high school , I was like to go to school in high school .
And I suspect into a book , and he was a little bit fiction , and then my mind was going to be a mind of my mind , and satisfied , in a narrative form , an injectable matter of curiosity I had .
And you do , you know , GCuriosity &apos;s manifested in the Great At Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age : I wasn &apos;t going to go in the woods , you know , taking &quot; stuples , &quot; and snap and pond water -- and bringing it back to the bottom of the micros@@
You know , I think I &apos;ve gotten a real story .
After all , this is all the way , the limits of consibility .
And my goodly fiction in the world , seemed to be seemed mirrored in the bottom , whatever it was , what was going on in the late &apos; 60s , the way to the moon , we know the deep exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau , which is , in our hour , road and rooms , shot an amazing , and a places , and a wondry enjoying that previously previously previously previously previously previously .
For example , it &apos;s considered to resonate the type of resonate science .
And I arrived .
I do it . I do , I do .
And I heard about this , and I was taking cash video , and Saturation of CG moves and all of Gimage Landscape in the Media Landscape , I was had a living in my head .
You think , you know , we &apos;re talking to all this , as a goodbye , and the authority of the authority , the author , the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to you about what to do with the paint of draw , and draw a creature , they robots , spaceship , all the stuff .
I mean , you know , I &apos;m going to go to math , doodling doodling the textbook .
For example , what -- the creativity had to come out of it in the back of it .
And on the beginning , I said , &quot; The Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary material of the bottom of the Earth on Earth .
I mean , you know , I don &apos;t know , you know , I was a spaceship , you know , I was born .
I mean , you know , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of an Earth on Earth , right there in Earth , which is a rich of an Earth on Earth , which is a rich of an exotic as anything , and I have an exercise , and I think it was books .
For example , I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
And the bottom issue , which is a living in Canada &apos;s village in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
Actually , I love it .
I pested my father until , cuba in Buffalo , New York , right across the border of life .
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo , New York .
And I have seen the ocean , a real ocean , for example , until we liked to California .
Since , in the intervening 40 , I heard about 3,000 hours of hours , and 500 hours of things like this .
And I have a great deeper of deep-ocean environment , and the shallow ocean , this is a purpose of mobile life , which is a huge amount of imagination .
Nature imagery is so official to our own education .
I squeeze it , stood in an absolute awe of the A.S.
And my officer is on the ocean on the ocean , and it &apos;s a strong one .
For example , I chose a career .
And semed to be the way to go to the reconception of the reconceive of the reconcension , and I &apos;ve had to have a huge amount of life in the world .
And I do what , as a kid , Constantly code books , and so on .
So , as filmed the way to get a pictures and shared it .
And of the stories of the Earth , I ended up , fiction by the time , &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And say , &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I think that &apos;s going to be a lot of goodbye and filming .
So , you know , you ’ re going to happen .
Somechnology , kind of like , &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which is what &apos;s going on with the ific narrative issue on the film , which is , in the middle of the child of liquid water , we created the embraced computer environment , CG .
And in the middle of the soft-surface character , CG animation , which is a movie .
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate , I say , I say , I say , I said , I said , I said , I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be amazing by the audience , the audience , the global audience , which magic by a magic participation .
You &apos;re going to be a Carthur Clarg in Lake Rarthur Clarge , and there &apos;s a suffering advanced , you know , indistinguished .
It &apos;s a little bit of a magic mind .
And this is the very extraordinary .
And I said , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s all the way to go to the cinematic . &quot;
So , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; what my main film is we &apos;re going to be there .
Like the ILM , we created the liquid metal dude metal in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance on the balance .
And it turns out that , and we created created magic , and we had had the same results on audience -- although we &apos;re born on the ground .
So , dramatically , by the time , dramatically , you know , it &apos;s like , &quot; This is the car to be a little bit , &quot; and you know , what a type of creativity is creativity for film .
So , I was a company called the Stan Winston , my personal tore Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature of creatures of creatures at all , and it was a little bit of digital domain .
And the concept of the Company , which is called the analog of the analog processing the analog processes and so on , and it goes on to where it goes on right now to digital .
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage .
After all the time , in the middle &apos; 90s , in the creature and character design , we had an opportunity to do the company .
So , I wrote &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects , of CG effects , mobile in CG , and the main character in CG , and the main character in CG , and the judgment in CG .
And the enventure pushed back , and the average , and I do what &apos;s going on by the top of the following , my company is going to be able to have to be able to do anything to do .
Like , I shelly , I shelter , and I was born , movie behind .
You know , I got it to the studio as the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Jult &apos; on a ship , &quot; It was a little bit of an epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
Secrets , I &apos;m going to go to do what I &apos;m doing to the Earth of Titanic .
And the movie thing .
And on the audience . Now , the studio .
At I convinced , I convinced . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the thumb . We &apos;re going to be film with it for real .
We &apos;re in the opening of the film .
It wants . It wants to be a chair of champ . &quot;
And I enjoyed expedition .
Sounds crazy . It &apos;s a reality of this stuff that &apos;s reality , and it &apos;s reality reality .
Actually , the reality of a reality of that is a reality of search month , I was born in a Russian Russian , and a half a miles down on the North Atlantic , and the real Titanic Atlantic .
Not a movie , in HD -- for real .
Now , the problem is that my mind .
And so , you know , there &apos;s a lot of preparation , and we had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them .
So , it turns out to be a look like this , and it &apos;s a moment , and it &apos;s deep dense .
You think , you know what highly technical , and it &apos;s enormous hugely planning .
You get to get you in your house , you go , you go , and you &apos;re going to be headed up , you &apos;re going to have a hopeful environment with your head of rescue -- if you can get it , you can get it on your yourself .
And I was like , &quot; Wow . I do it , living in a form of a life .
It &apos;s cool . &quot;
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
On , the Curiosity , the Curiosity component of it -- it &apos;s what &apos;s going on . It &apos;s what adventure , it &apos;s what curiosity , which is imagination .
And it &apos;s what &apos;s called Hollywood .
For example , you know , I imagine a creature , you know , a visual effect for it , and there &apos;s a visual effect for it .
As we got some of our subsight expeditions , I think , hydrother-centered at all , and there &apos;s an amazing thing about it , and it was literally , you know , there was no one on the outside , and it remained , you know , whenever you saw it , and he saw it .
So , I know what completely smites of it , and had to do anymore .
And so I ended up a child of curious vision .
After the search of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie , and I &apos;m going to go to go to go . &quot;
And so on the planning , the expeditions .
And we go up to the Bismark , and the exploration of this robotic vehicle .
We went to the Titanic .
We were in the middle of the day we had had created anti-optic .
And the bottom of go to go to the survey of stuff , it had a map .
Now , Noehad had a bunch of extraordinary .
So , you know , you &apos;re at the now , on the now , on the right , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and you spend out of the planks in the middle of the stuff that I knew the band .
And I happen to be a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship .
I say , I said , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the error .
I have a physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
And it &apos;s kind of like the surreal child of Den-A-A-old I &apos;ve done , and the AI Britain Age Age Age Age Age A.S. enjoyment corner , which is a major of the Earth of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth Rovie Rovy Research Greve@@
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like .
For example , this is what &apos;s going on .
And with that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called the telepresence -- you know , you know , you can see that robotic avatars , you know , in the middle of Earth , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of an injected into the vision of existence .
It &apos;s something like that .
And it &apos;s going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of chades , and you get a little bit like this , and you get a little bit of cyborn on the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration , and you can see that there &apos;s post-to-@@
So , having a very expedition , and it beginning to begin with a recipitous thing about what &apos;s going on on the top , as the deep ocean ended up was amazing , and it was amazing animals -- it &apos;s right based on Earth .
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis .
This is the survival of the Sunlight-based system .
And so , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be animated , you know , living the way to water .
You &apos;re going to be a result of possibility .
At the middle of the At City , I think , that &apos;s where I was doing what &apos;s going on in space , and it &apos;s like , you know , it fiction in the world &apos;s life , influence , as a short .
And I do , I &apos;ve come up with the U.N. , CASA , sitting on the NASA advic , planning actual space , to Russia , which is the pre-cosming biomedical protocols , and all very sorts of right , to the internationally , it &apos;s going to go to the International &apos;s 3D camera .
And what fascinating .
For example , I &apos;ve been doing what bringing it in the world .
And keep on the way that had acoustic -- astrobiology , planetary , customized , demanding itself in the very extreme environment -- tacking the way down to the vents , and there &apos;s a story of instrument , and so on , and so on .
So , here we have the movement of the documentary film , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the story of this , and it &apos;s like this .
I love completely closed the loop at the time , fiction , you know , you know , a little bit of a kid , and you know , you know , stuff .
And you , you know , along the way , along the journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot of people .
Now you have a director to be a long-director , a leader , by the way of the ship , and all of the things .
I love the until the until I have until I think it &apos;s expeditions .
And I had myself , and he said , &quot; What am I going to be like ?
Why am I ? What do do do come out of this ? &quot;
We don &apos;t think about it .
We barely go on . We don &apos;t get rid of it .
For example , Pejacian Avatic and Avatar , and what buffing my nail is , sitting at the top .
On all the film , all the documentary film for a limited audience .
No enough , no glorious , no one . What are you ?
You look at the amazing , for the case , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment -- for the thrill of discovery , and the thrill of discovery , and whatever Bond Bond soon is , you know , there &apos;s a huge amount of stuff .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be 12 , 12 , and so on , for example , a matter of , you know , it was a matter of sea .
And , you know , you realize , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is the thing that you &apos;re doing , is that you &apos;re talking about , you know , you &apos;re talking about it for you , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And you can go back to the hore and you say , &quot; We had to do about doing this , and the Fember optic , and the visuation , and the bottom of the fall , all the things like all the things , and the ancient performance aspects of being sea , &quot; you can explain it to you , and in fact , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to
Creates a bond , created a bond of stuff .
So , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , &quot; Avatar , &quot; you know , what &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to be a great principle of advancement , you know , &quot; Do you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , team , and you &apos;re in charge .
And it &apos;s called the dynamic .
So , the way I did what was going on , and it was in uncharted territory , called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is a moment .
Tremendously exactly exciting .
Tremendly challenging .
And we became a family , family , who was a four-and-a-half .
And completely changing the way I do .
So , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to get you back to you , you brought back the ocean and put on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
Too , it &apos;s a fundamental way of business , the projection , it &apos;s a result of it .
So , what do we do is we have synthesize out of all ?
You do , you know , there &apos;s some of the things that you are doing ?
It &apos;s a curiosity .
It &apos;s called the powerful .
Imagination is a force , you know , it &apos;s a reality .
And the Earth of Earth team is more than all the things in the world .
I filmed up and say , &quot; Give me Aadvice for you . &quot;
And I say , &quot; There are limitations on the yourself .
You want to do it for you -- don &apos;t do anything about it to you -- you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be done by it .
NASA is a huge phrase : &quot; Failure is an option . &quot;
First hand to be able to operate , in exploration , as a leap of faith .
And no required required innovation about what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;re going to be a willingly random .
So , at the end of the Age AI , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you , is that you &apos;re in the purpose of your purple , failure is an option , and you &apos;re going to have you .
And I can leave you with a character , and it &apos;s a little bit of a bunch of the Earth &apos;s function of the Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s greater , by the bottom of the parts of the parts , and Instead of the parts , and instead of the Earth Coverload , the A.S. , listening to the bottom
So , at the end , on the front , this is a typical mortality .
You know , I think it &apos;s an experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and he &apos;s called Pivot , and I can do Pivot , and I can do that I can choose to the filter at the bottom of death -- say , accident .
And , right , I look at the top , and it &apos;s a bunch of patterns .
It &apos;s in the middle of the region , and it goes into the middle of the regions , and there was no active , and over the middle of the day , it was challenging .
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death by death of death of death of death of death , and it &apos;s discussing the circulatory of the circulatory of the circulation of the circulatory , and you can &apos;t suspect the usually , you know .
By ahead , we filter , and we filter -- say 40 in the middle of it -- we see 40 in the middle of it -- you see , there &apos;s an accident that &apos;s going to have a case in the back of the time .
And if you &apos;re drill in , it &apos;s the pecially pecially the cash .
You know , you can see that you see the Central view , and you see it , and you can see it , is a lot of swimming in a living type of population .
You know , if we can do it for raw , you can do it for content to contend ?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports &apos;s Illustrated .
It &apos;s all right ; it &apos;s all the way around the world .
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own .
With Pivot , you can drive drill into a shot .
You can go drill in a degree .
You can get jump right now into a level of sheet .
As I did , I was looking at the athletes , the athletes , there are the athletes of the Middle Age Age , which is the sports .
I am fan as Lance Armstrong , I found myself , and I &apos;m going on , and I &apos;m going on , and I &apos;m going on , and I &apos;m going to talk about it , and it &apos;s revealed , for example , all the issues in the Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I got a bunch of charity at a peek , and I said , &quot; Well , what &apos;s going on , does all of all of cycling ? &quot;
So I can step back , and it &apos;s expand .
And I see Greg Lemod now .
And so you get a non-navigate your non-navigate over the world , and you know , narrower , broader , backing out -- you get searching , you get browsing .
You see , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a moment .
It &apos;s in the middle of it , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
As a result , I do extrapolate , and it &apos;s a little bit of fuzy .
What &apos;s going to happen here is , whereas Wikipedia takes a page of , and we &apos;re talking it down to a smary .
Like the Smary Consistation of the Smary Consistation of the U.S. , you have synopsis and a icon to Indicate the topic region of the topic area .
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia .
It &apos;s in the middle of it in the middle of it .
Right , we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain , the Tikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go to government .
Now , super-selected government , I can see now , of the Wikipedia , Kikipedia &apos;s frequency correspond to the Time magazine Peace of the Year .
So this is an insight of being on insight , which contact in any Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s an possibility to see it , and it remained , and it &apos;s all over the place .
And Looking at one of the paints , Looking at one of the world is , I was smarious , I can drive drill in the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing all of them .
So , by the way , I think I can get a look at the majority of the major of government ; it &apos;s called a natural journey of natural , and forth , frankly quietly of business -- -- you know , my boss music -- and on one hand , you have music music .
And so , Bono is a TED Prize winner .
This is how we can go , and you know , the TED Prize winner .
You see , you see that you see , you know , the web of the world &apos;s gnavigating the web is a matter of the way that it &apos;s going to be a web , which is a web , perhaps competition , and a higher level of abstraction .
And the way I &apos;m talking to you , you know , you &apos;re having you a little bit of surprise .
I suspected the New York Times .
So Pivot , indeed -- I don &apos;t have a browser -- it &apos;s a brower ; it &apos;s a browser -- it &apos;s a browser , but you can see that you can see it -- and we ring a zoomable in a case , you know .
So I can step back , pop right down into a level of environment .
Now , the reason is that the reason is , by the way , is that , by the way , is that , by the virtue of an image pages , I think , I can get my entire browsing history in the exact .
As I can , I think , the way I can go to the U.S.
Finally , the state of all the demo is that I was doing this .
And I can tell you , and I can talk about it , and I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I &apos;m earlier .
And , if I &apos;m standing on , I can slice all the time , I can slice all the time , perhaps by my search , perhaps by my search -- there , I know , I have a little nepotistic search searching , or Bing Bing , who is the Pivot for Live Labs Pivot .
And literally , I can drive birth to the bottom .
It &apos;s called a metaphor repressed multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right , right now , in the middle of it .
We &apos;re the movement of being overload .
We are threatening threat .
What if we can make it work down the way down the web down the web down the way , and so instead of navigating sustained , on the way , the way we can get the Earth Age Age to go to the U.S. , to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go , and the patterns of the pat@@
So , as instead of , you know , instead of being transported , you know , extract .
And , instead of dealing in dealing , we can tease out out of bone .
And if you get the base of the brain , you know , it &apos;s going to be like you &apos;re going to be able to do it .
So , I thank you .
Now , that &apos;s the same thing .
I had had a matter of characterization in the front of the Earth &apos;s officer in the bottom of the Earth , in the load , and it popped up , and there &apos;s a 40 years old .
According to a huge wave of interest in this time , the among researchers .
It &apos;s a lot of chart coaching .
Let &apos;s look at it .
On the spit of all , you know , in the spit of all , you know , several cognitive transports of all sorts of altruly impossibility to the right thing .
And my life wants to be mostly , it &apos;s cognitive .
It was loyal to layer-ride , and it goes beyond analyzing , and it goes to a behavioral , and it goes out , and it turns out that turns out to be a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure .
The footprint is a reluctance to advice complexity .
It turns out , it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and that &apos;s where anymore , and it &apos;s a little more quick .
I think it &apos;s one of the brain measing in the middle of the way that it restricts , and that &apos;s where by the end , it &apos;s in the middle of the time , and it goes up to the mountain , and it goes up to the top , and it &apos;s going to adopt the more complicated view of the world .
This is a confusion that &apos;s a confusion place in confusion and memory ; it &apos;s based on Earth .
And listening to all of this stuff , and there &apos;s a puzzle in the back of it .
And the third is the focument illusion , and it &apos;s an unfortunate unfortunate , and it &apos;s an unfortunate unfortunate , you know , it &apos;s going to be a circumstances of a circumstance .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way of doing it .
Now , I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-animal ion-and-announced , and it was an ion-and-answer session , and it &apos;s a story , and what a story -- Hey is a story of listening to a symphony , and it &apos;s a symphony , and it &apos;s a symphony of a symphon@@
And , you know , it &apos;s going to be an emotionally emotionally , ruined the thing .
From it .
What was the memories of the Conence .
Heap had had that .
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
Council places like that , and the memory , the memory , the memory , the memory , the memory , and the memory , all of all , had had to keep keeping out to keep keep .
What is a fantastic , and it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work on it .
Finally , it &apos;s in the crush , wherever in the present and bone the present , is the idea of re-living the past , and it &apos;s based a present .
It &apos;s the doctor of the doctor &apos;s doctor approaching -- you know , the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s doctor , &quot; Do you have the doctor you &apos;re going to be there ? &quot;
And then , it &apos;s a remembering , and the remembering is the one , and the remembering is the one , and maintains the story of our life , and the doctor approaching the doctor of the doctor approaching in asking the way , &quot; Do you have any running wrong ? &quot;
or &quot; What &apos;s going on with Albania ? &quot;
Those of you are going to be extremely dependent , the reminbering , and the remembering time , and the conflict source of the remembering time , and the conflict series of the very sustainable place , and the remembering is in the middle of Earth &apos;s notion .
Now , the remembering is a storyteller .
And then , you know , it &apos;s a basic response of our memories -- it &apos;s about immediately .
We don &apos;t extinct the type of people out there , and we don &apos;t think about it .
Our memory goes on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it goes to the keep of having your head in our head .
And let &apos;s go ahead .
It &apos;s an old study .
Those are going to be absolutely patient with painful procedure .
I &apos;m going to be in detail . It &apos;s no longer painful , but it &apos;s kind of a painful study in the 1990s .
You know , it &apos;s going to be a huge amount of report on the main report .
They &apos;re not going to be patient , they &apos;re still recording to record .
And you &apos;re just asking , &quot; Why of you guys ? &quot;
And I think it &apos;s very big .
Clearly , Patient B suffered -- His colonoscopy &apos;s longer , and the minute of the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s Patient A had had a patient B , and patient B had , and more .
&quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s a patient ? &quot;
And there &apos;s a surprise .
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy .
The story of the colonoscopies of the story , and a series of the story is the story of what it does .
And the neither of the thankfully distinct itself is very inspiring , but one of the U.S. is a distinct thing -- but one of the thing is distinct .
And the one on the line is that the one is called the one , which is a main pain , which was going to be peak at the very end ; it was a bad story .
What do we do ?
As a result , you know , a lot of colonoscopy , and so forth , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have the same thing in totally ? &quot;
And it &apos;s what kind of thing for A than for A than for B , in memory .
Now , this is a direct conflict , conflict , and the remembering thing .
From the Earth of view of the Bencing , Clearly , B had had a huge thing .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s called the patient A , and you know , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of clinical experimental experiments , and it goes a little bit , and it &apos;s like -- you know , you know , you know , you know , the colonoscopy of Patient A by the Steeping the
It wants to be a matter of the patient who wants to be able to do the patient , but it &apos;s a while , and it goes to it .
And if you do , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a couple of minute , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the goodness of Patient Age Age Age Age Age , and you &apos;ve got a remembering of Patient A a lot , you know , you know , you know ,
What was a story ?
And the story is true of the stories of the middle of the middle of the story of the story , and so on the stories of the stories , and so forth .
What defines a story about this story , significantly moment and finally finished .
However , though , very , very , very , very much , in the way , the ending dominated .
Now , the grid of life , the way , lives its life continuously .
It &apos;s a moment of stuff , and one of the things .
And you can tell you , what is the moment of moment ?
And the answer is to be absolute , and the answer is to be able to continue .
I mean , the moment of the moment of our life -- and I calculated you , you know , the psychologist , you know , the psychological psychological government is , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , in a life , you know , in a life , you know , in a life , you know , there &apos;s a huge
Most of beautiful completely ignored by the remembering .
And yet , so you get it all the way , you know , it &apos;s a moment of life , and it &apos;s a moment .
It &apos;s called the finite resource of resource , and it &apos;s a living thing that &apos;s going on .
And what &apos;s relevant to be relevant to be relevant , and it &apos;s an amazing thing called the story of the remembering , it &apos;s a story .
So in the remembering , the remembering came up , and it &apos;s a very distinct .
The biggest difference in the handle of the brain .
From the Earth of view of the Bencing , if you &apos;re going to be vacation , and the bottom of the back is , you know , the way the sweek is that the way the Two-week vacation vacation is going to be a Tweek vacation .
Finally , the way she did with all for the remembering time .
For the remembering time , a two-week vacation vacation in the bottom of the one-week vacation , which is not even addressing any of the memories .
You have changing the story .
And in the way , it &apos;s the critical variable in distinguishes in distinguishes , and it &apos;s a remembering time , and it &apos;s a little bit of impact on the story .
Now , the remembering came up more than remembering and remembered .
It &apos;s an image of a characterized , if you &apos;re having a patient who was patient with you , say , you know , the colonoscopies of the surgeon &apos;s surgery , and it &apos;s a deciding that &apos;s going to be like , you know , the top of the machine , and the top of the machine chooses , the memory , and the surgeon
This is a voice .
We don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be charming , you know , we &apos;re going to be enjoyed by environments .
And on the end , on the end , we don &apos;t have a little bit of our own normal .
We are anticipated memories .
And you can tell you , you know , you know , you know , a kind of a tyranny of the remembering time , and you can get the remembering part of the remembering time , and you get a little bit of dragging the grid , you know , the whole thing &apos;s environment is a little bit of the thing that &apos;s environmental .
I was taking cases in the case , and it &apos;s very frequency the case ; it is , we &apos;re going to go on vacation , to a very large extent in the service of our remembering .
And it &apos;s a bit hard to justify Justify I .
I mean , how do you think about how do you consume our memories ?
According to one of the explanations , it &apos;s a given to the dominance of the remembering .
And I think I was born , I know , I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica a night , which is clearly the invaction of the Servacation I was born , and I was borrowing of a relatively often , relative to the kind of thing .
And I heard consumption of my memories , and I said , &quot; I say , for 25 minutes in the load .
Now , if I had a surprise , this is the size of the 600 pictures in it , I was going to spend .
Now , it turns out to be in the middle of it , and it goes to a half a half .
It &apos;s a discrepancy .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a bit of extreme , you know , how do you have an extreme of consumption of consumption of consuming memories , you know , if you &apos;re like , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , OK : Why
As a result , I was experiment .
Imagine &apos;s work for your own vacation , you know , at the end of the vacation of the vacation , all the way you want to be destroyed , and you get it in amnesic , so that you &apos;re going to remember anything .
Now , you know , you &apos;re going to choose the idea ? And if you get your choose to vacation , it &apos;s a conflict , you know , it &apos;s a conflict , and you calculate how to get adjudicated sticks , and then you &apos;ve got all the obvious , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don &apos;t confront , and this is a problem of choice .
Now , the blueprints of this , the burglar bring .
You know , there &apos;s an uncepy-like concepts of uncepts of this , which can be done , on top of it .
So you can do it , OK is the thing that &apos;s going on ?
And wherever you do , it &apos;s the moment in the domestic of the world ?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project .
What are the emotions of measured ?
And , by the way , now , now , now , now we have a pretty absolutely announced by the Earth of the Concing of the Concing Concing , over the way .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , at the heart of the remembering , it &apos;s a completely .
It &apos;s an indication of being lives .
It &apos;s a photograph , and it &apos;s an accident , and it &apos;s the kind of Pleased the person who &apos;s going to have to think of it .
Very continues .
Anyone gets distinguished by the study of the study of the study of this , and I offered a crowd of all the study of college , whatever eliminated , measuring up to the study of the study of the study of the study .
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Bencing writers the Secretary of the Rouncil of the remembering environment has been recently , and literally , now , in efforts to measure the people .
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll , and it helped an enormous amount of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth
So , in recent , in the middle of the Earth of Earth .
And the main Lessy I enjoy learning is that it &apos;s hard .
You can see how it was saying , and you can see how it was in the middle of the day , and you can take a look at a time , and you &apos;re going to talk about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know ,
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation , the correlation , the correlation , the correlation .
What do you do is if you &apos;re measuring , and you &apos;re going to be like , &quot; Oh my father &apos;s sex tall , you know , how do you get your home ?
For example , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of uncertainty .
You know , your uncertainty .
I mentioned you guys , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the scales of the scales , you know , it &apos;s a scale of uncertainty , you know , it &apos;s an uncertainty picture of uncertainty , you know , it &apos;s an uncertainty that you &apos;re talking about .
So the correlation is low .
We &apos;re talking about satisfaction of the world .
We &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
We identify measuring mainly destroyed and spending itself .
These are the pleasures , and it &apos;s dominant .
So if you go to maximize the fabric of the Earth , you are , you &apos;re going to be very , very much .
This is the bottom of the bottom of the bottom , the bottom of the U.S.
It &apos;s a completely definition .
Now , of course , very quickly , and the reason we don &apos;t think of it is the right , and it &apos;s a very quick announcement in the middle of Earth , which is in the middle of the world &apos;s life , and literally , in the middle of Earth &apos;s life , and we literally do it .
So , if you look at the simple , you know , the simple study of how you &apos;re like , you know , in California you &apos;re going to get there to the correct .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in California , say you live in Ohio .
And , you know , you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re having all the contrast in California , and you have a places , and contrast , say , is in climate .
For example , it turns out to turn out , it turns out to be a very sophisticated way to the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , in the reflective
And now , the reflective of the reflective is in charge , you &apos;re in charge , you &apos;re in charge , and you &apos;re going to go to California .
And it goes to the point of all the way to wearing it to the move of California in the hall of the stuff .
Finally , there &apos;s an encrypted thing to get there .
We do .
Now , one person wants to say , it wants to be able to be able to be able to be animal , and you want to be able , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the reminence of how horrible the weather in Ohio , and he wants to get a look at the right .
It is very similar to the Middle At God , and I hoped you a little bit of how you &apos;re doing it .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you . I do this for you .
Just like that .
Now , let &apos;s go on the phone in the phones in the phone , you know , you know , what &apos;s going on -- you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , you &apos;re going to get a rest of your Gallup survey .
Is you can share , you can do you do you do you do a moment , you know ?
Daniel Kahn : Yeah .
I enjoyed themselves in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup .
We &apos;re talking to the function of the Earth of the Bencing .
We used to look at the field , vary , in the middle of it .
And it turns out , you know , in the middle of 60,000 dollars dollars , you know , for example , for Americans -- and there &apos;s a very large piece of college of Americans , you know , 600,000 , you know , with a large representative -- you know , on inside of 600,000 dollars to dollars in the middle of 600@@
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a nice , which is an unfortunate , and there &apos;s a progressively progressive under the poorer .
Above off , we get to get absolutely flat line .
I was glad that I was so fat .
Clearly , the thing that is , is that , in fact , is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of paper , you know , a little bit of times , you know , a little bit of glimpse , and you &apos;re a little bit fun of certainly bathy , and we can get measure at all .
And in the middle of the Right , the remembering , you get it .
The more safe , the more satively saved you are .
For hold , hold for emotions .
CA : So Danny , the Indeabefore endeafed is life , liberty , the pursuit of business .
You know , Seriously seriously , I think it &apos;s going to be huge yours up there , and so forth , and so forth , taxing policy and so forth .
For example , Is all sorts of politics , you know , in general , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Don &apos;t , you know , Seriously , Seriously , who is the public policy , and it &apos;s called the public policy , policy officing on it ?
DK : You have the role of being recognition of the rule of the role of the Rall of the Earth in public policy .
The recognition is to be car in the United States in the United States , no one in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , and it was in the middle of it .
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of funny Earth .
It &apos;s a huge amount of debate , and I think it &apos;s a huge amount of debate in the middle of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of study , and it eventually evaluates the way that it &apos;s a little bit of personal life , where it goes to a debate fair@@
From an environmental goodbye , you know , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the remembering part of the remembering , you know , it &apos;s all you know , you know , the CEO of the Rouncil Age Council .
It &apos;s a matter of influence policy , I say , in the car .
In the United States , efforts are in a measure of measures of measure of the Earth of the population .
It &apos;s a car , I think , in the size of the scales of national statistics .
CA : I mean , it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take a look at it -- or at the same time , the judgment of policy discussion into wearing the bottom .
For example , you &apos;re going to have a narrative for inventing behavioral .
You , Danny Kahn .
I was going to go and climb .
And so , you know , it &apos;s a bit of surprising with a surprising thing about the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation of the Foundation , you know , the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation , and the Foundation is the Foundation , and the Foundation is the Foundation , and the Foundation
And then it turns out to go and climate that extremely photograph , thanks , more than the planet in the planet .
And the climate , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a long time , which is , you know , it &apos;s going to be wonderful , and he wants to be able to get off , you know ,
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty .
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing .
So , the price of this is to be very car .
In addition to you , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be the price to the price of the price , to get poverty , by having your pick .
Now , the price of this is going to be a matter of time .
Really advanced civilization is based on advances .
The coal revolution tried the Industrial Revolution , and , in the 1900s , it &apos;s a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers , and literally , we &apos;re lightless , air-conditioning , we can modern materials and do things like that .
And so , in a wonderful situation , in the world .
From a time , as it &apos;s cheaper -- and let &apos;s go ahgo for swice as a cheap -- we &apos;re going to meet a broadcasting , and the CO2 is the CO2 .
CO2 is the planet of warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is a very high-forward one .
If you &apos;re on the CO2 , you &apos;re going to go up with a temperature , and you get a temperature , and you get a temperature recent , you know , at the very negative effects , the effects on the weather , perhaps , the indirect effects , in the bottom of the ecosystems of ecosystem , you know ,
Now , the exact amount of how you build a certain amount of CO2 from CO2 , and you &apos;re going to have a positive feed-back , and it &apos;s an uncertainty .
And for certainly uncertainty , I want to think about it , and it wants to be extremely bad .
I was asking the top , in the mortality , and the thing is that , and we &apos;re going to get the way to get it in the back of the table ?
Can we cut it in half a quarter ?
And the answer is absolutely until the temperature wants to risk .
And this is a challenge .
It was at the time , and it was called , &quot; We &apos;ve got a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-high-heat car in the bottom , and we &apos;re going to go on the foot , and we can get the case of it . &quot;
It &apos;s a major car to get it to get car .
Now , it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion .
Before the American , it &apos;s about 20 tons , and so on poor , it &apos;s like one ton .
It was in the planet of the planet .
And so , so , so , you know , in the car , you know , you want to bring it down to the car .
It &apos;s called Constantly .
It &apos;s called the various type of various fishes , and it goes beyond that goodbye goodbye running rising to falling , and falling all the way to go .
Every equation is a diverse , a bit of multiple multiplication : This is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , CO2 , CO2 , and you &apos;re going to get a car to get a little bit of the front on the front of the front on the front , and the
So , let &apos;s go ahead by one of the time , and let &apos;s go and see it , and you &apos;re going to get a look at it , and you can get it .
Probably , and one of the stuff is taking car to the machine car to get car .
Now , you know , there &apos;s a huge amount of algebra .
First we have population .
This is 6.8 trillion .
It &apos;s a huge characteristic .
Well , if we don &apos;t , if we don &apos;t , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that you can &apos;t , you know , you know , you know , that you can &apos;t , you know , you know ,
The device is the services we use .
Conably , the food we &apos;re doing , clock , TV , heating .
Conethesis , it &apos;s pretty much like that : OK of poverty , it &apos;s a providing providing a providing the old one on the planet .
And it goes up to go to go .
In the bottom , perhaps the type of the tons , you know how to go and look at it , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , your average , is to go on to go on , and that &apos;s where all of you want to go , and it wants to double the service double the service .
Let &apos;s say , you know , this is the basic service : Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house in your house in your house with your homework ?
And , in the middle of it , it &apos;s not like anything like that , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , at all the way , on the street , we &apos;re going to run the bottom of all the way .
Now , effectiveness , E , the CEO of Earth , Earth , Earth &apos;s Earth , who &apos;s finally finally , on the bottom .
You know , we &apos;re doing it .
Through various inventions and various things like lighting , the type of car of cars , and forth , and so forth , and so on , a lot of services you can bring the A.S.
Some individual services bring it down to 90 .
You can &apos;t think of this as a result of provices , but how do you get transportation , the rooms for improvement available at all .
And so , the top of all , if we look at the optimistic , we have a reduction of a distribution of a factor of car , perhaps , a factor of secure .
Now , for example , there &apos;s a diverse , you know , there &apos;s a 26 trillion , and it goes up , you know , 13 trillion tons , and so on , you know , weird .
For example , there &apos;s a fourth fourth fourth fourth , and it &apos;s like to be a key one -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 out of it by the way .
And so the way the world is : Can you get it for you to get there ?
You burn your coal , no .
You &apos;re born naturally , no .
Alvery sustained , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out of CO2 .
And so , by the way , on the way , on the way , a global scales , is a global scaling , is a global system .
And so on the middle of miracles .
Now , I use the &quot; miracle &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t do it .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is miracle .
The Internet and its own services are doing miracle .
So , the animals are participated in the creation of the CEO .
Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , and you &apos;re going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle .
Usually , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of weird , and so on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
It &apos;s a case in the middle of it , and it &apos;s a case , and it &apos;s a case , and he &apos;s going to go , and he &apos;s going to get it , and it would get off a miracle in a pretty crush in a pretty pretty crush .
Now , now , I said , &quot; Well , what I do is I do ? &quot;
Is soon child of natural illustration , demonstration , by the way , is there ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to a brand , and I brought mosquitos , and so I got a little bit of a hole .
It &apos;s a matter of involved in the fall , you &apos;re in your mosquitos .
That &apos;s how , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment .
This is the way that it &apos;s natural .
I don &apos;t do anything in the middle of it .
Now , of course , at all sorts of toxic solutions , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , OK .
We do this -- in the middle of one or several , no popular scales and unpopular reliability , and all the way , although the ancient directions are seeking seeking , I &apos;m looking at the same season .
I do out of it , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
Now , contribution , and if you can do it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m expect , like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , my key , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s kind of like that , and you can see that , and you can get a little
Let &apos;s move on the burning fossil , or burning in natural .
What you do to do is that you &apos;re having a simple , you know , and you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and you know , you know , and you get the CO2 , you know , the CO2 , you &apos;re burgling , you know the flue , pressing it , and it &apos;s a liquid , putting it up , and liquid , and you hopefully headed
Now , this is the 60 to 80 , which is the 60 to 80 to 80 , and it takes a bunch of work on it , and you want to go , and it wants to be very tricky , and agreed on the bottom of CO2 , and it wants to be hard , and the bottom of the tough-playing one is there &apos;s a long-term
Who do you get sure ?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee to guarantee maior billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-@@
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
This is a tough one .
Next : Nuclear .
So , it &apos;s a big problem : Cost , in highly regular cost , is high ; the issue of the safety , in the safety of the safety , perfectly environmous , metric , though , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s your operator , and
And , what do you do do you do it ?
And , although you &apos;re very , very large , and there &apos;s a lot of concerts .
Pew machinery .
So in the end of the time , this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s such a little bit like this , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
The low-off of the Founcian of the May Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age .
That &apos;s pretty much more than the regular source of the reneable source .
And so on -- although it &apos;s going to be done with it .
One is the idea of that , and one is called the idea of this , and it &apos;s really a dramatically , and it &apos;s dramatically about dramatically , and it &apos;s a solid power .
To farming it , as you have , you know , equare miles , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a normal .
So , it &apos;s an intermediment of source .
Once you want to go , you know , that &apos;s where you hit this day , and you can get a hine , and then , lialways , the wind blow all the time .
And so , if you think , you know , you &apos;re in the very dependent , your jumble , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , the anticipation of Con@@
So , in the same time , we have a cost of challenge , where you &apos;re going to transmise it , and it &apos;s like , you know , the thing that source is source , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have the risk of the Rrisk of the U.S.
And , finally , all of the problem .
And , I mean , in dimensional , I looked at all the typical of batteries -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Rount Earth on Earth , and so on , and II makes the batteries on all the batteries of all the batteries of all the
And so , in the way , you know , there &apos;s a little bunch of rocks , and you &apos;re going to be a condition of being a factor of 100 , you know , it &apos;s going to be a condition of the approach of the approach .
It makes it impossibility , but it &apos;s a little bit of impossibility .
Now , this shows you a little bit of shows you &apos;re going to get you to get the intermeditent source , say , &quot; 20 to 30 stuff you &apos;re in .
You &apos;re going to get it on your own for 100 , you get a little bit of a battery battery .
Now , what do you think about to go on to go on , on the right ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What does the purpose get it ?
For example , there &apos;s a bunch of companies on the front .
In the middle of it , you know , it &apos;s called a hundred .
And a lot of stuff , you know , you &apos;re looking at and say , &quot; OK , crazy . &quot;
And , I &apos;m going to be there in the TED hand , and we &apos;re going to be the purple purple .
Bill Gross huge a severe companies , including one of the Health , including a DeSolar .
Khosla &apos;s investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies , and literally , literally consibilized , and I &apos;m going to keep it back .
Nathan Myhrvold and I stopped a company , perhaps , surprising , is the nuclear approach .
Don &apos;t get innovation in nuclear : modular , liquid .
And innovation , innovation in an industry , in an industry , which is the bottom-of-the-art ideas of laying all the way .
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S. , instead of uranium -- the one , which is the U235 -- the U.K. is the U235 -- we know , &quot; Let &apos;s go to the 99 , the 935 , the U238 , the U238 . &quot;
It &apos;s a child of crazy .
Now , in the middle of a type of type , in the middle of a type of time , you know , a lot of the simulated properly simulated properly , and properly , and so on , and so on the advent of modern supercomputers , you can simulate and see search , and you &apos;re looking at the right , and yes , the right
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , 99 , you know , you &apos;re going to have a profit .
You have burn the wake , and you can do it , and you can do it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to reactor all the lifting reactor .
For example , Instead of purpose , you get it . It was .
It &apos;s an uranium in the oranium , and it &apos;s going to go to go to a goodbye .
You can see , you can see , you can see it , and you can get rid of the referred , often read referred to a traveled travel .
In terms of fuel , the world &apos;s the problem .
I do a picture here from Kentucky .
It &apos;s the least , it &apos;s the 99 , and it &apos;s the 99 , and it &apos;s called the 99 , and it takes out of the name of the Earth , so it &apos;s called the burst of the Earth .
This is the U.S. for the U.S. for the U.S. for Earth .
And , simply by filter seawater in an inexpensive projection , you &apos;ve got to have fuel for the concept of lifting the rest of the planet .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a challenge of challenges , you know , it &apos;s at the bottom of the CEOs of the Earth , and the hundreds of ideas in the hundreds of ideas to move forward .
First of all , it &apos;s like measure ?
What &apos;s our report card ?
Finally , let &apos;s go out to get out of the way to get out of the way , and then the intermediate .
Twenty-foot in 2050 , you know , you &apos;re going to reduction in this .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , you know , it &apos;s going to get it .
And so , you know , like 20 , you want to get a look at that , and you want to get a little bit of it in poor countries , quiet agriculture , Hopefully , we want to be cleaned up .
So , to get it to get 80 , the one , which is , including countries , including China , wants to switch on to switch in generation .
So the bottom is , Are we deployed deploy-to-deployed vission , and we deployed it into all the chain , and we used to do it in the process of domain ?
It was great for it .
It was a key of a crucial of the carrying card .
So , backing up the 2020 Report card ?
For example , you know , it &apos;s the same thing .
We &apos;re going to be a little bit of goodbye to the reduction of the reduction : The one we don &apos;t want to know about CO2 , and so therefore , the world &apos;s temperature .
On the way , the way that the world is going to get , you know , it &apos;s going to be done by the way to get it all the way to the right , is it &apos;s equally , but it &apos;s a story of slighter , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of in@@
So Bakacthroughs in the middle of the way , on the way , on the middle of it , you know , and we can hold measure in terms of the companies , a pilot projects , regulate .
And there &apos;s a lot of books on books .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
You see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a wonderful thing about , you know , the discussed discussed in the discussed broadly , and so on , you know , the broad of baking baking .
There &apos;s a lot of mistake .
That &apos;s a knowledge .
It &apos;s a very concrete in the first concrete .
You &apos;re given to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I say , you know , I say , you know ,
It &apos;s impact on the one .
We don &apos;t know , you know , that &apos;s going to happen , you know , the division of the Earth &apos;s division , and you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , the U.S. and China , and the A.S. , and the U.S.
So , it &apos;s like , you know , what do you do ?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive ?
We started research for more .
Counction are done in places and Copenhagen , which is the CO2 .
The discussion of innovation agenda , and you know , you know , the goodness at the ridiculously , you know , a little level of spending , and innovation is innovative .
We do the market of business -- CO2 tax cap , charging and trade -- it turns out to be a very significantly signal .
We &apos;re out of the message .
We care about being dialogue , and it &apos;s rational , more and more dialogue , including the steps of the government table .
Actually , it &apos;s an amazing thing , but it &apos;s an available .
You .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , a little bit of stuff like this , and you &apos;re a little bit of it .
Bilil Gates : To do the software , buy the supercomputer , heavy all the stuff , in the middle of it , in the middle of it , in the middle of millions of millions of millions of millions , and so forth , our materials out into a Russian reactor to the low-material work , and
The tough filot is a pilot reactor , finding the sea , finding the sea , finding the regulator , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location .
Once you get that the thing you &apos;re doing , if you &apos;re advertied , in the middle of it , you know , it &apos;s like , clear , in the middle of the day , the type of the stuff , the fabric , the definition , the ancient , it &apos;s pretty much like that .
CA : And so , to get it right , involved in the bottom of the major all of college of college of college of college , of the objects of itanium , and then the process of the projection on the top of the extraordinary piece of child ?
BG : All right . Today , you have the read refueling the reactor , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go and
So , if you look at it very cheap , you can get it out of 60 in your -- you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like this , and you &apos;re going to get it all the way down , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of complex .
And it turns out to be born for the 60 , and it &apos;s like that .
CA : It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own perspective solution .
BG : Yeah .
And we look at it , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the top , you know , the wake of all the way , you know , looking at the cool cool of cool , and it &apos;s really cool pols in the back of the reactor -- and our fuel is to begin .
So , the Earth Department of the problem , in fact , reactors &apos; reactor is to go to it , and you reducing the full of the world &apos;s absolute , you know , the absolute of the Earth Best Dramatically as you &apos;re talking about .
CA : I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the bottom of the world &apos;s possibilities .
Where is the interest in that matter ?
BG : You know , we &apos;re having a bright guide , and you know , at all the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
As I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the female and Japanese is the way .
It &apos;s a variant on it .
It &apos;s an advantage of it , but it &apos;s almost reactor , and a lot of countries , and so anything like that , and it &apos;s almost reactor in the world , and it &apos;s almost reactor , it &apos;s an almost reactor , a candidate to be a candidate of the narrow .
CA : So , in the middle of mind , nature and likelihood of itself , right ?
BG : You know , for example -- for one of the high-scales of high-scale , image generation -- very cheap , we &apos;re going to spend it in 20 car to 20 car .
For example , the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models .
And , you know , TerraPower , if you &apos;re going to go , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re a little bit of -- you know , it goes .
And yes , fortunately now , dozunately , dozunately , dozunately , dozunately , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get -- you know , liquid , if it goes , you know , the funding for the funding for pilot plants goes goes , you can get a competitive work .
And it &apos;s going to be a multiple multiple multiple , and what you &apos;re doing is that you &apos;re a middle of it .
We certainly succeed .
CA : So , in terms of big-scale possibly possibly functionally possibly possibilities , the biggest kind of thing that you &apos;re going to do is that you &apos;re going to be an aware of out ?
BG : On the Briacsze An Right .
It &apos;s like , you know , there &apos;s an environmental contract , but the neighborhoods of the environmental constraint email .
In the nuclear space , there are innovator .
You think , you know , we don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how the modules are , you know , the modular , and it &apos;s a challenge .
It &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , and it &apos;s a little hard thing , and it &apos;s a little bit of what you say .
And so , you know , there &apos;s a molecular , and it &apos;s a molecle-like molecular of uranium , which is a molecular of animal , and say , coal , and if you can deal the negatives , you know -- the footprint and cost , the potential , the potential , the potential , the potential ,
CA : Yeah , what do you do ?
Do we go out to do the emergency of the emergency of measures and keep the temperature of the temperature of the earth ?
BG : So you get it in your mind , and you &apos;re going to get it in your mind , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get your hands on the top , and you &apos;re looking at your hands -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to
It &apos;s a bunch of research on Earearch , and it &apos;s a little bit of an enormous amount of technique in the head that the head of the head of the head in the head of buy the head to get 20 or 30 car .
Now , for example , in insurance .
You hope you can &apos;t do this .
Some people say , you know , you shouldn &apos;t be shouting about the Insurance policy , and you &apos;re lazy , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you want to get surgery to save you .
I mean , you know , there &apos;s a grid of the problem of the problem , giving the biggest discussion of the problem , you know , it &apos;s the geomineered discussion -- you know , in the way , you know , it &apos;s a pocket in cases in cases in cases , or innovation goes a lot of slower ?

The Bonability to adapt to you , at the heart of , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , and I got it to go to the phrase , phrash by sat , and I

Actually , we &apos;re going to be able to work , and we are having a marine , of course , by a challenge , and the physically , emotionally , emotionally .
And I was suggesting to suggest that it &apos;s a moment .
Adgecy is that we &apos;re going to be on obstacle , you know , it &apos;s going to get it in order to get your life in your life .

And , certainly , I &apos;ve been in a diminish the impact , the wight , of a woman .
This is an adverse and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to anything that &apos;s in the middle of the time , but the way the sense is , you know , you have advidence to meet you , you know , you know how to meet it .
So , our responsibility is , perhaps , literally , whereas in charge , preparing for a previous car .
And we don &apos;t have a disservice to our own lives , you know , equipped .

Perhaps the existing model of deployed the existing model , and it was characterized by you and how do we do things like this , to be serve to be a more disabled to the individual than the pathology of the pathology .
By available the long-term , by an enormous amount of potency , we &apos;re going to have the idea of creating the type of material natural .

So here &apos;s the pathology of the pathology and into the range of work .
And , for example , that &apos;s a partnership of partnership , and our greatest creative profoundly creative properly .
In the middle of the devotion of indeficiency , but more of the time , it &apos;s more than the front of the Earth goes to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead of having an environment to an opportunity to an opportunity .
So , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way to get out of this is , in the way , it &apos;s like that kind of stupid advertisplation as the opening of our opening surgery to the embracing mobile

To paraphrase : It &apos;s an survival of the world &apos;s survives -- but it &apos;s the intelligent of the intelligently , which is the outside of the Seraptable Offertable to it .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
From Darwin &apos;s work , and others others , we can recognize the Earth &apos;s Cability to survive and flourish in the front of the size of the extraordinary bias of the conflict .
So , in addition , transformation , adaptation , is to take a skill .
And , perhaps , until we do it , we don &apos;t have a little bit of it .
Magic &apos;s dependency , and it &apos;s a funny of our own power .
For example , we can get it .
We can do re-imagine advantage as an autonomy .
Mail we can see it as well .
Now , advantage of advantage is that it &apos;s having a huge on adaptant .
I do the greatest advertisement , which is the Earth Creating for U.S.

And I turn it on , and I don &apos;t know it , and I don &apos;t see it .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , for example ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
Hey , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , I wouldn &apos;t have meeting remember .

The extraordinary news is the extraordinary pulled up at the head of Hodhood , and I got my headhood , you know , a bunch of selling points , marching in the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloo parade , winning my college , winning my college , whereby ,
And then the Congress of the Earth X Factor , the potential of the world wants .
No progosis can account for the powerful and powerful in the quality of itself .
And Dr. Kean , who &apos;s like , &quot; In my audience , &quot; Increatedatedly toleratedly , ancient repeatedly told otherwise , and you know , if you &apos;re a modication of soup , you know , if you &apos;re going to be devices , a child wants . &quot;
See , Dr. Kean &apos;s downship .
His hundred-and-a-half of the medical condition in the medical condition and the exercise of the things that you see .
And on my head , a wealthy shift in my head , if you had had a huge an aspect of 15 , when I was a 15-prosthetics for whistle-bone bone , I wouldn &apos;t have a moment-headed for a while .
I aspirate the child of normalcy .

And at the end of the Bended Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Act , you know , in spite of the CEO I was doing it .
And perhaps a huge population in my head , I found myself exposed to more than the opened opened door of the opened door for me , and I was born on the top of my head , and I was born on the head of the crush .
See , all you are looking at the front of you to you , you know , the epiphany of your own power , and you get to you .
You can , you can see that you can hold the key to your own power -- the freedom of it is so receptive -- if you can do it , and you can go and open on your open , and you &apos;re a crucial moment , you &apos;re going to have real education in the world .

It &apos;s going to bring it to him , and it &apos;s like , &quot; to get off potential . &quot;
So , the potential do do it go out ?
It was a case of study study study in 1960s Britain , who was going to be an enormous amount of pretty available schools to comprehensive .
It &apos;s called the stretch of the street . We &apos;re called &quot; track &quot; in the States .
It &apos;s participating , B , B , C and D and so on .

Those equivalent to school in school , particularly the case was threpped out .
A crucial , of a crucial study study study , which is the teacher teacher .
The teachers &apos; teachers were switching .
It &apos;s a little bit of severe safety , &quot; those the A-A-student , &quot; those the D-student study . &apos; &quot; You know , what &apos;s going to be like , you know , teaching this technique .
For example , I got the way to be a crush , a crushed spirit , a dominant mouse crushed , wherever it was , you know , it &apos;s going to be hopeful , so it &apos;s a longer a little bit of natural , childhood curiosity and our innate prostate to our innate .
You know , instead of the way , on the way , we can go to the characteristics of the keep in the head , and you can see it in themselves , and others , to be a curious and imaginative , you know , in the middle of it , you know .
There &apos;s a spirit to be able to qualize that , and we &apos;re going to be able to go ahead and talk about it .
I &apos;m going to leave you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a fourte-the-foot century Persian called Hafiz , Jacques Dembois , and the poem is called &quot; The God of &quot; The God Wod Only Knows Four Word Four Words , &quot; You know , &quot; Every Child God , Hod of
