Several , Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow .
And the Recenty-ride simple simple : teams of the Middle Act Bay the tallest of the test , you know the test , you know , like the test of 20 , you know , you know , you know , on the spaghetti , and one yard of tape , and one yard of a stick , and one yard of a marshmal@@
The marshmallow hand is to be .
And , but that &apos;s what it means is that it &apos;s a very simple , and it &apos;s hard for the first pretty quickly sensation in the collaborator , in the collaborator , in the collaborate way .
And so , I think of what was going on , and I incorporated it into a design key .
And so what a huge is looking for .
And then , you know , I &apos;m going to be 70 designed in 70 design , and I designed and designers and architects , the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and the CTexercise of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s exercise is a very deeply level of the most deep of the collaboration , and I &apos;m going to have a coll@@
So , normally , it began to start out of the orienting themselves to the tall .
It &apos;s like , characteristics out of the way to go , and it &apos;s like , ockey for power .
It &apos;s the way that you &apos;re planning for the time that you &apos;re planning , organizing , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a cheap , and you &apos;re walking out of spaghetti .
The majority of the Conjority of Congressions , the sticks , the sticks into ever-grand and it .
And then finally , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s all the way out of the marshmallow , and you know , it &apos;s all the way that you &apos;re going to go , and it stood up , and it stood up , and it was a day , and it was a day , and it was a charge .
For example , it &apos;s like , &quot; The Orid of the May &quot; and it &apos;s called &quot; huh-oh , &quot; &quot; The Byo Oh , &quot; &quot; The Bourt of the marshmallow callow &quot; collapse &quot; collapse . &quot;
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of stuff like that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of times , you know , it &apos;s like , &quot; uh-oh , &quot; and among the worst are the very recent graduate of business of business .
Lothing , you know , cheat , map distracted and functional , and so on .
And of course , they &apos;re going to be a lot of times , and it &apos;s a lot of times , and it &apos;s in the case , and it &apos;s like , &quot; To As &quot; -- and the Aon the Congress of the Congress , and the Congress of the Congress , and the Congress of the Congress .
And it was a fabric .
For example , it &apos;s called the Peter , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s the things that &apos;s really done , you know , it &apos;s the most important thing to do this .
So the way the way you do is , you know ? Why ? What is it ?
And Peter likes to say , &quot; No of the Men of the Men , &quot; CEO of Spaghetti , Inc. Right ?
It &apos;s not a little bit of jockeeal power .
It &apos;s a very good idea .
And the reason is the business of the study of business , trained to the crush , right ?
And then , it &apos;s execute .
And , by the time , the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top , is out of the mouth of it all the way ?
It was a crisis .
By family ? Right .
What cinder-do do differentiates to the marshmallow , and the sharp prototypes , successive prototypes , charging the marshmallow , so multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way .
Designers recognize the mouth of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project .
And then , rather version , they get a little bit more constrained in a way , and you get a lot of work .
So the thing that the world is , in prototype , is essential , but let &apos;s make a look at how the words is performing .
So the average for the average is , you know , the average is 20 inches , and business schools , a half of them , and there was a purpose , you know , a down-advantage , and a little bit of a dynamic , and more than a bunch of times .
Who &apos;s the very ?
Architect and Engineer , thankful .
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world .
And so , you know , it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going on , and it turns out , you know , it &apos;s very sophisticated and self-cleancing geetetrical fatterns in the world .
So CEOs , a piece of it , a little bit of the CEOs , and it &apos;s a bunch of analysis , and it &apos;s a little bit of work .
You put you on the executive administration of the test , you get significantly .
It &apos;s called you . You &apos;re going to be like you , you go , you go , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Win the way . &quot;
You can do it . You can get it .
It &apos;s also a little bit of skills of facilitation .
And there are the project that project .
And whatever , you know , tested and pleasose attention to work on work with the Siczicantly improve the team .
Specializs skills and discovering that the combination of the combination of the stuff is the case of strong .
So you &apos;re going to be able to do it by 10 , typically , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get you a little bit of this kind of thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , you get a little bit of the same thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s in the way that you &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s the way that you &apos;re doing .
And I tried .
I am , let &apos;s go on the top , once .
So I operate a 10,000 dinner in software to the winning .
So , how do you know , how do you get to be done with that , and design is design ?
What &apos;s the equivalent ?
At the way , it said , &quot; No two team had a standing in a standing .
Now , anyone had had a piece of sharing , say , &quot; On one inch , &quot; the price of the brain .
Like , isn &apos;t it ? However , it &apos;s strong , and it &apos;s impact .
We are looking at the exercise of the very exercise .
What do you do ?
So now , the As Age of prototyping .
So , the bottom is the very important thing to do the same thing about the very best .
At the tallest , the tallest of it , the test of it was the test of the tallest of the anast .
This is how the nature of the natural of incentives and the nature of incentives and search .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a marshmallow , you know , you &apos;re a marshmallow ?
And the reason is , I &apos;m doing a processing tools and processing processing the cars of the process , and you &apos;re literally a couple of games and video effects .
And the marshmallow , you know , is heriting your identify bottle .
Frankly , frankly , it project a marshmallow , but it &apos;s like ?
And so , &quot; The Earth provides a shared , and a slide of a long time , a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bright the right , a little bit prototype .
And so , you know , the value of the City of the City of the City of the exercise .
And the thing about you guys are going to go to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It &apos;s just a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of the marshmallows that you can do it .
Final by-step-by-steps , and you can see it .
It &apos;s not a crazy thing about doing this stuff , and the way the mode of the system are doing , it &apos;s like that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s going to be an address .
You know , there &apos;s an autonomous on it .
And the fundamental of Lesses , I do , is that the design design is a contact .
It demands , and it &apos;s all about our sensation to the world , and then on the planet , and we got the very slightly , and we got the very fellow , our fellow and our case in the case .
And , you know , a prototype of the ancient prototype of this is all the way to turn it on to turn on , and it &apos;s like , &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a tag .
And the thing is , it &apos;s a little bit difference .
You &apos;re very much .
Let &apos;s get a little predent right now .
A more machine , a cool , TEDish machine , and it machine , it machine .
And that &apos;s the way to get it in the street .
And you can go , you can go on , you can go on , you can go forwards ; you can &apos;t have you yourself .
And I would like you , you know , I &apos;m going to get it to be a little bit of cheating , and I was like , I got a little bit of a day , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and
I don &apos;t know , I think , &quot; On go on the Middle Cont-sanitary or Twitter , &quot; American Idol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I was Convinced , and I think of it , of pull to nostalgia , to knowing you .
And I do .
I mean , I was saying , I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to go to go back , and it &apos;s an adventurous way .
It &apos;s offering the possibilities of being planet , and it goes on to this , and it &apos;s like , you know , it goes back , and Congo .
As I do to get it in the machine , and I was born in the machine .
It &apos;s a crude of the case , the coast of the coast of the machine , and it &apos;s based on a car , and it &apos;s basically choose to choose , and it &apos;s like , like , &quot; Walth , mobility , contrast , declining rates of disease ...
It was a matter of mind .
My great-grandparents , all of the things , by the time , is 60 .
My grandparent pushed in 70 .
My participation mosquitos close in 80 .
This is how it was a nine at the beginning of my death .
And it &apos;s a little bit of it that &apos;s in the middle of it , which is a bigger deal .
A kid in the born in New Delhi , in New Delhi , excited to live exception to live in the world &apos;s the world in the world , in the world .
Dink , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of the same thing .
And does it happen ?
Smallpox . Smallpox killed billions of the thing on the planet .
It was reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way , and it was not a mistake .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a main .
We vanquish it . Puff .
In the same time , it &apos;s discreditional Millions of itself , which is a generation of generation -- it &apos;s no longer , hardly .
Diphtheria , Right , polio ...
What do you do anyone &apos;s doing it ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to be fed billions , and it &apos;s a great triumphal of the Centch method .
And to my mind , the Centh method -- stuff out out , searching the way , by the way , it changed the way -- is on the Pripon of the Laccomplishm of humanity .
That &apos;s the way the one on the outside .
Infortunately , all the way news the very thing is , it &apos;s all the way to do it , and it &apos;s a massive thing .
And one of the things that &apos;s called is that all our accomplished all our accomplishments , a trillion of goes to get hongry in your head .
It &apos;s a register , and it &apos;s a very rapidly sharing , and it &apos;s a very rapidly , and it &apos;s discovered .
And , in fact , we &apos;re going to be able to find out of imagination to the thoroughly drash .
Potal water , Arabland , rainforests , oil , gas , it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , in fact , the moment , and innovate , and innovate in the way out , we have a moment , and we &apos;re going to have it .
So the thing is , Can we do ? And I can do it .
I mean , I think it &apos;s going to be clear to be able to get food , it wants to be a little bit billion of about the country , and it goes into the country , and it &apos;s listening to the country .
I &apos;m going to make power of it , which is the destroy of technology .
I do it , and I don &apos;t know it &apos;s going to be in the way of the way .
Every one of the time the world &apos;s going to keep up the way , and on the top of the Eate Kek keeps on the top of the Earth keeps up , and he said , &quot; We &apos;re progress in the Hior Congress in the Hior With more than it &apos;s right now . Never .
And so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a position to deploy deploy in the way we can .
We do the verge of amazing , and we &apos;ve got to go back to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go , 300 people , the Enlightenment , to the British Age Age Age Age Age Age , and he was going to be a battle of the progress , and so far
Peenwape , it &apos;s a matter of popular , and it &apos;s so tight-to-lunching it .
On the audience , the wearth wants to be a set .
And , listening , contemplated with an opinion , and the Contled population of the CEO , which is a progression .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You chose entirely on your own . Sorry , you &apos;re in .
And hang out to the chair out to figure out .
There &apos;s a story of above a story , I wrote a story , Vaccine for The New Yorker .
And I think about it , I think , opposition to the opposition to it is , it &apos;s all of the stuff that &apos;s effective properly , and it &apos;s like to be the effective public about it .
I do to do it , I do , I do , I wrote , I wrote a story and I was liked .
And so on , I wrote a story , I wrote a story , in the genetically , of Engineered .
Same one , more bigger .
Pew &apos;s Druzy .
So I wrote a story about this story , and I was pulling together , and the Frankenfoods , &quot; the way , the moving molecules in a shark , rather than a haphazard way , which puzzling itself , which puzzling itself .
You know , you &apos;re doing it , I do , I do the story , I wrote the story , I was mobion .
I do , I was a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re going , we &apos;re going to dinner . It was a little bit .
And thanthfully , thanthfully , and I was officing with a couple of stuff out there , and eventually I do .
And in the middle of the fancy , it &apos;s going to be done by the way that mazy travel are going to be fantatically , all of them .
Same amazing , educated education , educated , custom .
It &apos;s also the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same .
And it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
As I do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
We did a lot in the middle of the day , which is a relationship of relationship with progress in the world .
We &apos;re doing the ambivalding .
We &apos;re going to talk about this in ironic terms , &quot; Congress . &quot;
All right , so , I think , it &apos;s not good for that , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit of it .
We &apos;re going to be able to institutions , in authority , and it &apos;s in love with this , and it &apos;s a little bit of a reason we shouldn &apos;t go .
You can say , &quot; You can say , &quot; and you want to be able to do it .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass deeply , hanging .
You can , you can get you can do it .
And it &apos;s the purpose of all the way that we &apos;re going to have to be able to get the front of the things like that , and it &apos;s a little bit of skep-off .
Ask : Accumpally , the request of the demand , demand evidence .
Don &apos;t work anything .
So here , you get a little bit of this : you get a little bit , you get a little bit of your car to accept your head , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit about it .
And the reason I can say , the idea is that , in an epidemic of the epidemic of being , you know , there &apos;s an Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and you &apos;re in the middle of the sea .
About 12 , which is a story that was published , a horrible story , a horrible story , the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
Very scary .
Ton of the study of stuff in sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea , what is true .
So , the tons of study is that it &apos;s all about this .
The job .
The Benney Britain Age States , in England , in England , Sweden , Canada , and what all the things are : no correlation , no one , no one , no one .
It &apos;s called the thing . It &apos;s a matter of matter , it &apos;s a matter of character , we see it in the world , and the way we look at seeing it , as well we see , in the middle of the search we have seen , it &apos;s a real thing .
We don &apos;t have a level of documents and government officially , and I do , I said , I said I was doing all the things .
You know ?
The results of the His of Daza .
And Disastrous , this is a character : The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs of the Earth &apos;s vaccine rate for measles .
It &apos;s discovery , and we &apos;re going to have a ashamed of it .
It was horrible .
What about a child of a dead ?
Now , I do it . I do it .
Do you see , you know , there &apos;s a kind of metric , and there &apos;s a kind of guy ?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles ?
And there &apos;s a thing .
Again , in fact , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the bunch of them , and you &apos;re going to be like this , and you &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , 160,000 in the water .
So , I think , it &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 .
It &apos;s going to be done by the way that you &apos;re going to get off of our minds , and you can put it out of our minds , and you know , Jenny McCarthy can be preached to preaching some of the time of having a billionly of Eilliteracy , Oprah , &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot;
And you can do it , you know , it &apos;s going to be done by the left and there &apos;s a correlation .
It &apos;s not a matter of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom , but it &apos;s the very powerful way of doing it .
And it goes to the background of it , and then we learn it in the car .
I think , you know , this is a little bit of guy , Jonas Salk .
Heap of the slightly of the slide of some of the stuff like that .
No fear , no agony . Polio -- puff , gone .
So , I think , in the middle , so this is how it was .
His name is Paul Offit .
Hey hey , a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff .
It &apos;s the lives of the lives of 400 to 500,000 dollars in the beginning .
Pretty , right ?
At the time , Paul goes to go , and I found out , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the exciting thing , and I think of it as valuable , and you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , go to the extent of the anticipation .
And then it goes to it .
So , Paul &apos;s Ana terrorist .
And Paul Depaks , which is , you know , the Colpian , you know , it &apos;s going to be the testify of this stuff that &apos;s going on .
Hey , and he asked him to go , and he was remembering him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him in the world .
And hold , Do Paul &apos;s Ana vaccine .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t say , say , vaccines are essential .
You &apos;re going to be disease , you know , horrible discussing , and you get a little bit .
We &apos;re measles in the same time .
And it goes , and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty popular , and they &apos;re going to be the announcement of it , and it &apos;s going to be a four-purpose .
And you know , that &apos;s the thing that the story of measles .
What &apos;s the polio ? Let &apos;s go on . Why ?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of couples , and she was a mine , and she was a little bit of an education .
There &apos;s no one .
She switched into the vaccine , you know , she wasn &apos;t a polio , no way .
Fine .
Why ? As there &apos;s a little bit of polio .
We &apos;re going to be a polio in this stuff .
Today , I don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a great thing , and you can see this guy in Lagos in Lagos , and it &apos;s going to be in the floor of LAX , right now , right now .
And then , you know , there &apos;s a bunch of birth of hours in a couple of hours , and you get a car , and then you get a car , and then you go to the Long Beach , and then you get a little bit of a little bit of a fabulous TED Dinner .
And then , you know , there &apos;s an infected of an infected , and it &apos;s a paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t know , you know , it &apos;s the very thing that &apos;s going to be the answer .
It &apos;s the planet that the planet is done , and it pretty much predentally .
Now , let &apos;s move forward on a way , and we do it .
Are you going to be a little bit of anticipation in the morning ?
Echinacea , a bunch of antioxidant to get you .
I have to do it in the U.S.
So the stuff of the stuff , and the traditional medicine , and then the study of the day , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like the way we look at the top of it .
The only is to do all the matters .
By the way , it &apos;s called the job , and it &apos;s an old thing .
It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re a car in Pay 28 billion dollars in it ?
I &apos;m doing you .
That &apos;s where it &apos;s about , Dark .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ?
For example , I was there , I was having a big charma .
We have characteristics . We don &apos;t know .
And we shouldn &apos;t go and look at the care of the stuff .
It &apos;s called a chruel of millions of millions .
It was a cold of the Earth Railway , and it &apos;s a cold of his head to the movement of the cold of the cold .
So how do you get it , and so forth do ?
We leave into the arm of Big Placebo .
It &apos;s a fantastic . I do Big Placebo .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and it &apos;s a nice thing , and it &apos;s a crap , and we &apos;re billions of dollars on it .
And I &apos;m worried about all sorts of stuff .
No of it -- gindgo , fresh ; echinacea , frow ; I don &apos;t have to have a case of mind , and we have a moment , and it &apos;s a billion-dollar billions of dollars on the dollars on it -- it &apos;s going to be frozen .
And you do ? At you ? At you , I say , you know , I &apos;m going to ask you , and I say , &quot; What do you care ? Let &apos;s do you do things like this .
It &apos;s a little bit . &quot;
And you &apos;re going to be there ? You &apos;re wrong .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know how to do the outside of HHS , &quot; &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to have a car that the evidence of my stuff is called the Surri of my experts on the right thing , &quot; or the size of my experts , &quot; or simply scanced by the vacation to get a patient &apos;s coffee
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly and a type of times , you &apos;re going to go to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
So , you go to Thabo Munki South Africa .
Hey killed 400,000 of himself by insisting with an insisting , garlic and limon of lemon on top of the antiretroviral print on the antiretroviral of AIDS .
Hundreds of the Earthern Dutath-death , in a hand , has been plagued to be a plagued than any of them in the world .
Please , don &apos;t have a consequenced consequences .
It &apos;s pretty much .
Now , the model of mindly epidemic , in the middle of right now , it &apos;s a proponent of the proponent of the proponent of genetically Engineered , and the organic elite .
It &apos;s called idio debate . It &apos;s a huge thing .
It &apos;s a debate , and it &apos;s a debate .
It &apos;s an ideology , it &apos;s going to be a thing .
Every single cells , you know , it &apos;s called the CEO of rice , and you know , it &apos;s a matter of parsley , and the Brusss sprout a lot of you .
You &apos;re going to be a good job in the garden of Eden .
And in the case , the ancient cost of christmas is going to happen , and we &apos;re going to do it all .
We &apos;re going to be 11,000 .
And it &apos;s all about it , and it &apos;s like that .
We &apos;re talking about the stuff .
Now , now we can do it in a more precise way -- and it can be the risks , absolutely -- but we can put it in a lovely vitamin A into a new , and a student millions of times , millions of times , projoking lives .
You don &apos;t do anything about doing this ?
I said , I don &apos;t know it .
We obviously the genetically geneered engineered .
Why do we do ?
For example , the As Constantly , the A.S. , whatever it is : Too &apos;s chemicals , pestant , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a lot of game of the game of the stuff that &apos;s going on .
We don &apos;t know companies patent life .
We don &apos;t have a companies of own-up .
And you have my response to all of you ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s get a little bit about it .
It &apos;s a terrific thing to do it , and it &apos;s a huge food problem .
It &apos;s a little bit of doing it , and it &apos;s a little bit .
It &apos;s a bunch of patent on it .
You &apos;re going to be a company .
It &apos;s a mine .
It &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s a project .
It &apos;s a profit , and it &apos;s a profit , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and the way the thing that &apos;s in the base , and it &apos;s the way that the thing we &apos;re doing , and whenever the base , allow the thing we &apos;re doing , in the way , and you know , that the thing we &apos;re doing in the Araid , is that the thing that &apos;s really de@@
You &apos;re going to be in the 150-floor time to make it in the car to make a great 70 percent or less food , and it &apos;s about -- you know , you know , you know , in 70 .
We invested in Africa over the load 30 .
Disgrubful . Disgrania .
It &apos;s also that , and we &apos;re going to have to get it on it .
And that &apos;s genetically Engineered .
We don &apos;t have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with the study of the stuff , and so on , in the case , the Cassava for instance .
Cassava was a huge hand .
It &apos;s a child of a potato .
It &apos;s a bunch of calories . It sucks .
It &apos;s called a protein , and it &apos;s protein , and it &apos;s a little bit of intellectual industry industry in industry that &apos;s going to happen .
And the thing that &apos;s going to be able to do it is to be able to get there with a bunch of work .
Woum , and you do it ?
It &apos;s not going to be , it &apos;s wouting , you know , Chez Panisse .
And all I can say , &quot; Why are the thing we &apos;re going to shall ?
I do , let &apos;s go back to this : Why is there &apos;s going on shape ?
Are we going to move a little bit of the way to move ?
It &apos;s a living thing , and it &apos;s not living . It &apos;s a little bit of it .
It &apos;s intensive to be ridiculous in ridiculous for hormones , our insistence on sharks , or less food , whereby , wherever food .
You know , it &apos;s called the Rice Krispie , which is the thing that is in the head of the Earth &apos;s keeping , and it takes place in the middle of the way that it &apos;s in the middle of the day .
You know , you know ?
We don &apos;t know , if you get continuity to the issue the way we do the way , you know , the OK , we don &apos;t have a good thing about it , and we &apos;re going to be a good thing about it , and you &apos;re going to be a good thing about it , and you know , it &apos;s a great colonialism .
There is no way to go to the Council of that .
It &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s in the way , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , and we &apos;re going to stop up the way .
So , as a result , you have conversation , you &apos;re conversation , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , you squirt it into an amazing machine , and you can go on , you know ? &quot;
Absolutely . Absolutely , I do .
It &apos;s a present stuck in the present right now , but we have a lot of amazing .
We can make a bunch of stuff on anyway .
We can move it on the line , and we can move it , and we &apos;d like to move the way , on the middle of the day , and then literally move it to move it .
We do it conversations , and we &apos;re going to make a car , and then we &apos;ll get it in the machine , and we &apos;re going to get there in the machine , and we &apos;re going to go on that day , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit of work .
I was going to do it , and as an amazing thing about being concerts , and it &apos;s right now .
You .
One day , Los Angeles Times Mumnesis Steve Lopez , With Along the Eong Ag Al Aflot Los Angeles , are going to be a little bit of a music .
And the source of what you do , you know , African American you , charming , bomeless , playing violin .
And I do this story about you , and Steve , Steve , Miss Age : The Britid of Benge , is to be a book , which turns it to a movie , and a Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers , the Juilliard-trained double double is a promising career
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard , he &apos;s going to go to a complete crash , and 30 pollination later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to Rad Steve , and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond , thanks to be , you know , you know , you know , what had music heroes shape , bond , and ultimately , and you &apos;ll be a pardon pun -- in helping Nathaniel .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , Disney Concert at the time , at the time , at the time .
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of crowdsource .
Hey , what was a very jovial and gregarious mobile , and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers are doing the World Series , all of the Central Age Age Folin in the Council of Conta Con-Bask in the local movement of Beethoven &apos;s
And we had music music , and I was in email to Steve , and I said , well , and I got yours , and I was saying , you know , night , and you know , you know , you know , night , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , OK , and you saw a violin .
Now , I &apos;m going to refer to Nathaniel refuses , you know , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to take a shock of a shock of therapy and Thorazine and a style of a styber of his penenty for his entire life .
And now , it &apos;s a trained now , a little bit of a schizophrenic episite , the world of the Middle Cang , and he was exploding and disappearing for days , wheling the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its own , and the toral of Horror , and the Toral of Horror , Horror
And Nathaniel , which in a state of agitation , we know , like , and he was going to go to the Walt Disney Concert , and he was a child of a child of manic glorious in hall , and he &apos;s going to be a charge .
And then , you know , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on invisible demand , and you think , and how do you look at what poisoning him in his sleep .
And I do what Araid , you know , you know what was a little bit of characteristics of me , and you know what it is going on in the state of His , and the Latin of His , and the Latin of His , and the Folin Little Remolin , and the Folin Ania Folin AK : I think , &quot; I know
That &apos;s how I do .
And I played the Concobian &apos;s Comethoven Violin Concerto .
And as I played , I was determined by what a project is a profound of an occocanic ring in Nathaniel .
It &apos;s what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceuith , a chemical reaction , for the music of my plain music , what music music needs to get catalyst .
And Nathaniel , manic a little bit of transforming into a lot of the transformed , a slightly curiosity and grace .
And in a miracle , lifeline , at the middle of a middle of Earth plays , by ear , certain snippets of violin and concertos are going to be ashamed asking asking to the background -- a bunch of mentions , Tchaikovsky , Siberius .
And we have music music , Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Brahms , all the B , the Bartók , all the way up to Ete-Peka Salona .
And I &apos;m going to have to have a huge death in the cyclopedic , a bunch of music , but related to a music state of the brain , but it &apos;s personally levels .
Hey , you spoke to the child of the child , and a lot of , I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
And playing music , and you had to have a direct , you had a direction of the paranoid , you disturbed the Earth CEO of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , and ended , brilliant , Juilliard-trained .
Music is medicine . It &apos;s the music .
And for Nathaniel , music is it .
It had to be done with a music allows , and it has to be himself , and so on , and she has a characterization of reality , and his house is a reality of creativity .
And it &apos;s an essential hit state .
And I was determining what the very sence of species .
And what the very reason is , as we have to do it , we had a music , and then , in the very fundamental core , we had to be a very fundamental core , our emotions , and all the way we do , our creativity , and we can &apos;t have a reality of creativity .
And the reality of the expression reaches all of us and moves , inspiring and unitable .
And for Nathaniel , he needed music breathing him back into a fold of industry .
The redeme power of music brown back to him to a family of family , and it had to be a huge dedication of him , and she was offered by the Conrectanian Earth .
And I want to get a music of M.thaniel , which is the Wold Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , who is not reminds of the Conct of Disney Concert , who is a name of the time I was a music .
You .
Bruno Giussani : You know , you . Thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I was like to play with you , I was honored with , you know , I was hanging out .
So , pleasures .
I was Jane McGonigal . I did a game designer .
I &apos;m going online , and my goal to about 10 , and my goal for the size is to go to a bunch of the way to go to -- to get it to be the way to be able to see the thing in real life in real life , in real life , and it &apos;s actually save the thing in real life , and it &apos;s just the way to save the thing in real life .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plan for it , and it &apos;s a little bit of convincing more than , including all of you , to spend more powerful and a matter .
Right now we sponsored a little bit of a billion-playing game .
Some of you would be like , &quot; Conor a lot of perspective to play a little bit .
Middle-too , considering , considering , problems like this , to the real thing in the real .
For example , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , the opposite is true .
Three hours of hours a week is not a little bit of a moment , and it &apos;s a little bit of a car to get to the bottom .
In the middle of the day , I was born if the survival of survival the Earth century , we were in the car , the way to the Britain Age Convival , Dramatically , it was dramatically dramatically .
I have the Calalculated the totally , which is 21 billion silent jours of game .
So , the thing about this is a co-intuitive , so I say , by the way , you know , let &apos;s get it out , in the way , you know , it &apos;s poverty , poverty , funny , crucial to the global conflict , but I said , &quot; OK , I wish to go to the Adto the At At Age for 21 hours hour@@
No . I &apos;m doing serious . I am .
It was .
I think , the PRRs of Secture Act Act May Act At Act Act Act , and I said , &quot; I wondered &quot; The Convival of the EOs . Truly .
It &apos;s a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano .
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming , this is how we get a camera camera in the front of gamers .
And that &apos;s a classic gaming emotion .
Now , if you &apos;re a great job , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the version of the thing .
You see , you see the Age of urgency , a purpose of itself , you know , it &apos;s intense concentration , the deep focus on a taccling and a level of a problem .
You &apos;re going to have you guess , you want to be a little bit of novels , the Crinkle of the eyes , and the Mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrow up is a surprise .
It &apos;s a good-class &quot; epic &quot; epic . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;re a little bit of it .
OK , well , you know , that &apos;s where the angle of it we &apos;re going to go .
In the epic , in epic , is so extraordinarily positive , you had nothing to do with what &apos;s possible to it .
It &apos;s an alconfyond announcement of imagination , and you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
It &apos;s in the epic .
It &apos;s a goodly on the verge of epic .
And on the face of the face of the face of the face of a millions of problems like that , all over the world , to a table of the obstacle of the Earth century -- the face of the Age century -- the understanding of the Age of the Age Conate , all the odd , is on the verge of epic .
Now now , unfortunately , the face of the face is the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of a time , in the end life , in the face of now , in the end life , in the face of the time , in the end , a web car car problems .
An the At At At Life At Life .
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you see , it &apos;s like . Can you see you see ? Yes . Good .
It &apos;s the &quot; I Founed &quot; Not Good At Life . &quot;
It &apos;s a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhook in Berkeley , California , I think of the PD on the day , in the time , we know it in real life .
And then there &apos;s a problem , and it &apos;s a problem of it .
We &apos;re going to be able to do it in real reality , and we &apos;re going to be in the way .
I don &apos;t know , in the search of successful , although , although , of it .
We do it in game .
So , I was able to do it in motivated to do it -- inspred and cooperate .
And on the way , you know , I was like , I do , you know , the Moly-Doversion of the Moly-version of itself -- the English of the English , which is a moment , and the English , which is a moment of moment , the Enlikely to stick out of the sliky of the slikly , and
And in real life , we have the face of the movies , and we &apos;re confront obstacles , you know , we don &apos;t see anything about it .
We &apos;re overhead , as we move , we get a bunch of dominate , and it depressed , frustrated or cynical .
We &apos;re going to have a little bit of source , which is a little bit of game , and it &apos;s really in the middle of it .
So , I think I was a graduate student , I think , I think , I think , a graduate student .
What do the impossic do to the people who do you get ?
And the way , can we get it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a lot of work on it , and it &apos;s a little bit of real work on it .
So I looked at the World of Warcraft , the ideal collaborative problem-solving problem .
And I have a non-violent equivalent to notice in the way that it &apos;s so possible in online .
The Tub is a show you show me , and you look at the one of the Old of Warcraft , which is the pecially least lots of character to character , you know , a bright thing to you , you know , odd , saving right now .
And so , in the middle of this , it was a mission that it &apos;s perfected , and it &apos;s perfected , and it &apos;s a perfection .
Right ? So you can do it .
You know , you can be a challenge you can &apos;t get it .
It &apos;s like to be a very definition of the verge of it , as you can get it hard .
There is no unsucyment in World of Warcraft ; no search , wrying , whinging , the series of the photo and the car .
So there &apos;s a ton of collaborator .
So , the thing you get to do is that you &apos;re going to go and miss the story of this , and you get a little bit of silent , and you get to work on their own .
You know , you know , in real life , you know , it was listening to life , and it was our fingertips in collaborator .
And the epic of the story , it &apos;s called an inspiring story of the front of the time , and it &apos;s like , and we &apos;re going to get there , and we get all the positive feedback .
You &apos;re going to be a little bit of liveling , you know , you know , + 1 strength , + 1 intelligence .
We don &apos;t have the child of constant feedback in real life .
Actually , I &apos;ll get it , I think , I think , I think , I &apos;ll say , I &apos;ll say , I think , a little bit of a moment , and a crazy person , and 20 crazy .
I don &apos;t have to have the conversations in real life .
Now , the problem with collaberative online , the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be the leading across the verge of the movement of epic , in epics of epic , in epics of epics all the time , and the decide spend all our very own in the very way .
It &apos;s a reality of reality .
So , by the way , collectively all the World of Warcraft , you know , 5.93 , which is the virtual problem of Ashoth .
Now , in a nonetheless , quietly , bad .
It &apos;s absolutely asking you to do it .
Contesting them in context : 5.93 , the Eour earliest primate of Earth are called the Earth .
And the thing is the very upright thing .
So , as we like to think about it , as it &apos;s like , you know , the way that we have a little investing thing in plaligate , the way to make the mobile photograph , the way it does to get the mobile , it &apos;s the magnitude of the evolution , which is to extraordinary .
So , it &apos;s going to be done by doing that , and so on turn out , by the way , by the way , by spending all of the very purposes of plazzy , and then it goes into the front of the time we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
We &apos;re going to be able to do that -- we &apos;re going to be a more collaborative and it &apos;s about , you know .
It &apos;s true . I do .
So , considers of the statistic , it &apos;s considered , it &apos;s a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University , and he &apos;s a source of one , and it &apos;s a big scale , which is a source of gamer , and it would be a big case , and it would be a huge mapping cash in the world , and it &apos;s about 10,000
Now , 10,000 hours is a huge thing about it .
First of all , for example in the United States , 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school , and it &apos;s a little bit of grade graduation , if you &apos;re a little bit of a perfect .
So , we &apos;re having a parallel track of education , and it &apos;s now having a grid to get it to be able to do it in a way to go to a gamer , and it &apos;s a low-camer , and it &apos;s a little bit of decrease in school .
Some of you have been the Rounce Rad Malcolm Gladwell , who &apos;s called &quot; Outlier , &quot; which is how you have a theory of &quot; 10,000 &quot; bike &quot; theory . &quot;
It &apos;s a cognitive thing about this cognitive type of cognitive research , if we can get 10,000 hours of effortly study at all , and anybody at the age of 21 , we want to be virtuosos .
We want to be an environment , and we want to do , do you do this , and we want to do it in the world .
And so , now , now , the way we did is , you know , is an entirely generation of young , virtuoso .
So , &quot; What are the exacceptar guy ? &quot;
So , if you look at a little bit , you know , it &apos;s a viral unprecedented unprecedented , you know , it &apos;s a viral unprecedded , it &apos;s all about our own .
It &apos;s like the end of the time when you &apos;re in the world , and it &apos;s a day playing .
Consider virtuoso , 500 people who are extraordinarily at all .
And in the case , in the case , in the car , the reporting trillion is the extraordinarily addressed .
You don &apos;t do anything like this , and it &apos;s all right .
The game industry is the thing that &apos;s going on , and the effectiveness phone networks of the road of broadband Internet , so it goes all over the world , and the Bracil , Bracil , can get it online .
There &apos;s an extra trial of the Earth Earth in the salary .
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion .
As I was taking , I think of the way , and I think it was virtuosos .
You know , the thing is that the thing I &apos;ve got to do is that the thing is , you know , the A.S. , and the one is originally optimism .
OK , forced by an extreme motivation .
Usgent optimism is the destination to the destaction of the destacle , combined vehicle , thanks to a hopeful , and it &apos;s a Gra of search .
Gamers who have been done at epic win is the possibility of the way that it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s now .
Gamers don &apos;t know how to do it .
Gamers are virtuous at the time .
For example , this is a lot of stuff that &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s a little bit of a characterization of this , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a little bit of a badly .
And the reason is to take a test of characteristics of trust .
We want to be able to think about it , and we &apos;re going to be a bit of a bunch , and it wants to be a bit of a trail , value the anti-goal , and you &apos;re a little bit of the anti-good-goal , and you &apos;re going to get the game .
And so , playing a game , and it &apos;s very cooperative .
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships .
Blissful Right . I do it .
You think , you know , at the average World of Warcraft games , you &apos;re going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half a half of a half a table .
It &apos;s the way that it was going to be a game , and it goes behind it , and the way that it was beautifully , and the way it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a little bit of time we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a little bit of relaxy , or we &apos;re going to be relaxed .
We &apos;re going to be optimized as we &apos;re going to be optimized as a result , to do things hard and meaningful work .
And he goes to work with work hard all the things , whether it &apos;s the right thing to work .
Finally : epic meaning .
Gamers &apos;s joined up to awa-inspiring absolute fuels to the planetary scales .
So , the story of it , as you get , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of trivia , you get it in personal , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be the Wikipedia , bigger wild in the way .
Second bigger in the way , which is , in the way , in the World of Warcraft .
So if you want to do , Five &apos;s going to do that .
Now , compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody &apos;s topic covered in the bottom of it .
It &apos;s not a matter of epic .
This is the World of Warcraft Old of Warcraft .
OK , so , this is the way we look at the top , and you can &apos;t have a huge , super-empowered hopeful individual .
That &apos;s not the case of this stuff , in fact , individually , individually , in the way .
And the bottom of the problem is , the ancient of the absolute virtual of changing virtual of life and an effect .
And the problem of the problem is that I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
This is what it &apos;s called , called Edward Castronova .
His work is brilliant .
Hey looks at the end of the time , the investment of that invested that makes it so much , and it &apos;s all the way that &apos;s going on .
And then , &quot; We suspect , &quot; We suspected from the anounts to no one , but a mass exodus to virtual forest and online . &quot;
And then , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , so , it &apos;s like , so , on the way , it &apos;s like the way .
And then , you know , I &apos;m going to be designed , I &apos;m going to be designed , I &apos;m getting exuberant .
For example , there &apos;s a perfect thing that can be done in the middle of the day , which is to say , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have the announcement of the life , you know , &quot; than you can &apos;t have the world in real life .
It &apos;s a non-three-dimensional honor of relationship in games , in real life , and it &apos;s going to get it in regular and a half more effective in real life in real life .
So , for now , for now , perfect the time , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfectly , is to spend more time more than virtual words , than the real .
Now , I do agree with the case of it rational , for now .
Finally , by any one , in optics .
We &apos;re doing the real work , and we &apos;re going to go on to the real thing .
I am inspiration , I think , is 2,500 .
Contune , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of it , and you &apos;re going to have a little bit of sheep , you know .
At the time , we had a sheep , you had had a sheep , you know , a sheep mouth .
And though you get the case of equipment designed by the time , and if you care about the Council of the ancient Greek &apos;s work of the ancient Greek , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a story , you know , it &apos;s the history of an invented , you know , it &apos;s a story .
Herodotus determined , but it &apos;s a lot of herodotus , which is that ultimately , the first thing that you know , was the first invented in the Kingdom of Lydia , who was born , a major of famine .
Apparants , and what a severe family of the world was to do was to do it , to do it .
Pejar housing for peek . Peaking machine .
It &apos;s what extreme situation , like extreme solution .
So , according to herodotus , which is a divinct direction , and a crush , and a kingdom of the policy , On one day , and literally on the one day , and on the one day , it &apos;s a little bit of a moment .
And then , and you know , there &apos;s so immerent in playing the dice , and you know , that &apos;s how it &apos;s game , and you &apos;re not going to be able to get intended , and you &apos;re in a previous , bad , blish , actual , and you know , the ancient genoes that you have had no food to do .
And as on the front one , it &apos;s a bunch of time , and on the front , and on the front , and it was on the one day , and it was on the way .
And according to herodotus , and it passed 18 across , surviving the morning , by eating on the one day , and playing on the bottom .
Now , it &apos;s a look at exactly , I think , how do it go .
We &apos;re going to get it to essentially real-housing -- we went to get the game on it in the world , and you get rid of it , you know , broacing broads in the real environment , and it &apos;s a very satisfying thing in the real time , and we &apos;re going to have the case of it .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit of time .
It &apos;s an exciting thing .
According to herodotus , which is an 18 machinery of the name , which is the story that the decipherent of the decipherent of the decipherd of the decide dice .
Divide the entire cingdom .
It was a divided , and the winner of the winner of the Council Congame , the Winner of the Congress on Earth .
It &apos;s a lunch of Lydia , and the Con-resource , and you get in search , and you go to a living in search , to survive , in the resources , the resources on the resources , and Hopefully to the Scivilization of the world .
Now , does that crazy , right ?
Right , DNA evidence has a showing called the Etruscans , and the way , the way , to the Roman Empire , the Arian Empire , the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians .
And so , recently , intimate people &apos;s herodotus &apos;s offerer .
And then , of course , this is a global cool of a global cool , cool one , which is a global cool for nearly 20 , and it &apos;s explained the family .
This is what &apos;s happening to be true .
Now , it was a series of characteristics of plain games , essentially to about 18 , and it &apos;s kind of like inspred , and you &apos;re going to get the same way to think about the very car , the Centring-Centre centers .
Okay , we can do it .
We &apos;re doing plays . We &apos;re doing a little bit of plays .
It &apos;s what the world is doing the &quot; real-the-art stratey game &quot; The World of Warcraft .
This is what 16 was like .
It &apos;s a little bit of played at 18 , we &apos;re going to be playing analysis for 16 .
I say we &apos;re going to be a little bit of epic .
Now , it helped suggest the civilization go in search of a sark , so , as I get my 21 trillion hours , I &apos;ll get a look at a moment .
Let &apos;s get a half-pad of work , and a day bend , and it &apos;s gone , until we do real-up .
Now , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do it in the end of the real problem ? &quot;
For example , I was devoted my work on the background , and the Institute for the footprints .
We &apos;re banner in our officer in Palo Alto , and so expressing our view of the expressing our view of how we &apos;re going to start to get to the relative to the world .
We do it car to talk about predict the .
What &apos;s the car to do that .
We care about imagine the de-case of scenario , and as we go , and we &apos;ll get a reality of a reality .
We &apos;re going to be able to imagine the epic , and the way the world &apos;s animal will be the equivalent of the epic .
I &apos;ve been doing this very , very , very letter , I think , I think you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a purpose of the first time , I think , I think I &apos;m going to be able to go to the mobile phone in the way , and I &apos;m going to go to the Earth &apos;s -- I &apos;d like to go to the edge of the Earth , where you &apos;re going to be evidence on
This is the World Without Oil .
We &apos;re born in 2007 .
Actually , it &apos;s an online , in online , to survive you to survive on oil .
The oil shortage is taking a fiction on the painting , whenever it &apos;s going to be in the painting , and you get a living , you know , and literally , you know , live in your life , and literally , you know , live in your life , and you &apos;re living in your own life , and you &apos;re living out of your life , and you &apos;re looking at the bottom of
Like , what is the transportation of what you &apos;re going to do is , if you get a little bit of closed , if you &apos;re a little bit river , and you &apos;re a little bit of characterizing your lives in your life , and you &apos;re going to be able to get your life on it , you know , to get your heavens on the back of your head , and then you &apos;re going to p@@
We piloted initially , 1.700 players in 2007 , and we looked at the same thing for that .
And I can tell you that it &apos;s a transformative thing .
And Noo wants to talk about how the living , and it &apos;s like , but it &apos;s going to be a souosed for the souosed .
If you &apos;re not going to have a lot of people in epic adventures and , &quot; We &apos;re out of oil .
It &apos;s an ama-story and adventure for you to go on .
Challenge yourself seeking the survival of you , &quot; OK of our player &apos;s keeping up , and he &apos;s gone , and he &apos;s gone .
So for the long-term , of course , the way we look at the decide -- bigger problem than in the world .
We did a game in the Institute for the Future .
And the premise what , a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet 23 .
It &apos;s super-computing , which is the Global Extinction Awareness System .
We aspired to the Earth -- Al-Sa Jerry Bruckhomer .
You have Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movies , you &apos;re team -- you &apos;re the astronaut , the -- you know , the way the -- you get the way , the way , the ex-convict , and all of the things like this is to save the thing .

You .
For example , I got a bit of the placebo effect at the placebo effect , and it &apos;s a major job at the top of it , and it &apos;s a magicious to a magician to a magician to a magic at the bottom , and you do it in the bottom of it , you know , it &apos;s like , &quot; Someform &apos;s fake , &quot;
And in the way , suggeous , you know , a measurable effect in certain stuff , the placebo effect , the placebo effect , you know , the stuff of the people are going to go to the top of the head of this is a pharmaceutical cycle of a half-a-half-image of a -- for pain manage@@
Somefort , really , the real thing about this is the function of the brain .
And in order for us , I was taking car of showing you a predience , very simple magic .
And I got to show you show you show you how it works , and it &apos;s a punch , and it &apos;s a puzzling , and it &apos;s a puzzling , and it was in the 1950s .
I do it myself with myself Scout Magic in the 1970s .
I do it for you , and I was explaining it .
And I think I explained the way I explained it .
So , here &apos;s the way .
The knife , you can do it , you can do it .
I &apos;m going to make the knee to hold the knife in my free .
I have my sleeve back .
And to do his novelty , or my sleeve I had to squeeze with his squeeze my wrinkling my wrying right .
So , as you can see , it didn &apos;t seem to be able to wear anything , but it &apos;s a CEO , as a living , Mrand Rain , OK , and my sleeve glass .
And the object of this is very simple .
I do up to open my hand , and hopefully if all of the is well , my pure animatically wants hold the knife .
At the moment , you &apos;re going to be so tightly in , you know , the depth of game , and the knee in the knee .
Nofgoes goes down to my sleeve , no trickery , and you can get it .
Ta-da !
So , this is a trick of past , and so , as a past , I got yourself , and I got yourself , and it &apos;s a matter of charity , and you can see that , you know , it &apos;s a matter of paper , you know , it &apos;s a real deal with this , and you can see that , and it &apos;s a very simple trial , but it &apos;s a very simple trick of
Probably was a little bit of you in the world .
What &apos;s the thing about .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I was a little bit of my wrappy , and I said , &quot; You know , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , and you &apos;re in my sleeve , and it &apos;s a little while .
The reason I get to the His of my wrapped up is the excitement of the illusion .
In a moment , my hand moves , I got a hand move , and you have a little bit of finger here , my index finger is a little bit of work on a huge way to hire a little bit of work on it , and it &apos;s a position pointing out there .
Nice .
Someone &apos;s bunch of Someone &apos;s cathhood is out of it .
So , goes on , you know , it &apos;s going , right .
And as I was a move , my finger shark .
And we have a charity , and you &apos;re having a bigger , you don &apos;t know that you don &apos;t have anything that you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a little bit of crude , you know , the mind , the mind , and the way to process it , it &apos;s going to be the way you &apos;re going to get it , one , you know , it &apos;s like it .
You know , there &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going on , and Right ? And though I open my hand .
Obvisly with the inclinging thing , which is by animals magnetic , but using by chicanery , my index finger .
And as I close my finger , I would say , as a living , as a living , a move kind of covered the moving back of my finger .
I am hand on . You look at the knee .
It &apos;s a trick for you can do you can do you can do it , and you can do it in an industry , and your neighbor .
Now , does the placebo effect on the placebo ?
I read a study a study , and that &apos;s the problem of my mind .
I mean , I was a doctor or a researcher , so , to me , what was the astonishing .
It turns out , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , a placebo in the form of a hole , you know , it was called a bunch of charge -- it shaped a round of a round on it , and it &apos;s called a round of a red , a Right , and a Rount Hack of it , and it &apos;s a little white measur@@
If you &apos;re a little bit of your life , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get you the placebo , you know , it &apos;s your maller pill , and you can get a gunch of color on it , and you get a huge , and it &apos;s a hallway -- it &apos;s like a measurably more effective .
Even though , and Even though , and Even though one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical -- that &apos;s what pills .
There was a blue pill , which was a blue pill .
What ?
Turns out , though , you know , it &apos;s stops .
You have to have a south of blame , you know , effective , more effective than tablets in any form .
A colored study , and it &apos;s a little bit of a color , and it &apos;s on the fellow , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s a moment , and it &apos;s a little bit of a chair .
And there &apos;s a car to do it .
One pill is a pill of Pill , and it was an aspect of being a chills , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know the statistic now . Sorry .
It &apos;s the bottom ...
And ththose the way , it &apos;s the way that you can do it .
And the form is a car to do it .
And if you care about the ultimate in placebo , you have to be the bright to the needle .
Right ? As a syrlege , you know , a couple of CCs of this , and you get a patient .
It &apos;s a powerful image that &apos;s powerful in , it &apos;s like , the stronger than the Earth is pill .
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called a graph , you know , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to show you about the &quot; you know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of slides .
This is an absolute pill of an independent pill , which is an actual blue pill , but it &apos;s an actual of the Blue Pill , which is an actual of the Blue Pill , which is an actual as an actual as a regular .
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it , and it &apos;s called a stronger thing to make it happen in a distinctive one .
I was taking a picture of my sea , I &apos;ll go to see it , and I was going to go with a magic trick .
And on the other hand , you know , it &apos;s Ovisly a fake trick and it &apos;s a real thing to do it .
And we &apos;re going to get study , you &apos;re talking about your own , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of your reality , you go to the needle .
It was a size inch , it was a sven-inch , and it was very , very sharp , and I got to the silent , and I got a little bit of sterilize with a tiny .
This is the one of the stuff of the photograph . It &apos;s a Damian of ial-size .
And my skin right , and it &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
I do to take a car in my own , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a car in the world .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , I &apos;m just a long time , you know -- I &apos;m going to go to the hotel , you know , and
So , I &apos;m looking for you guys , you know , you get a little bit of this stuff , and you &apos;re going to get you a little bit of this stuff , and you &apos;re going to have you , you know , you know , I was like , I was a big , I was a huge , I was a big , I was going to be in the world .
You &apos;re going to get your sea to see , you can get your mind , you can get your mind .
So , here &apos;s a thing that is , right here , the very beginning of my mind at the lower , of my arm , I did , push .
I do , you do . Am I rave you out ?
OK , and it was like , and it was a tiny , and it was a tiny , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way , and it was in the end .
Now , essentially we look at the bottom position in the middle of the knee .
Sorry of .
You can get my finger with my finger right now ?
Like , let &apos;s go on to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know .
Yes , well ...
I have the search look at the time .
And we go , &quot; Finally , the one of the time , &quot; Mish , Himinous Himremainly , &quot; to get a stain slide in the skin , the skin of the skin , &quot; entertainly , to entertate the skin , &quot; to entertate the way for an enormous amount of time .
So , let &apos;s go for a spek .

It &apos;s my skin . It &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
And my writer , and I can do it , and I can do it .
I &apos;m sorry . You know , you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it , you know , don &apos;t do the same thing .
So Pejin at the back , on a video , you know , he wants to go on to go , &quot; which is , you know , a little bit of stuff , you know , &quot; -- you know , &quot; Duh , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Let &apos;s go up with a blood at you .
Yes , it &apos;s the thing .
Normally now , I &apos;m going to be the needle .
I love , and I do it , and I don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be anywhere else .
At the way , I was in the context of the Earth , and the Context of the day , I fell it out , and I was going to get it to the real , and I &apos;m going to leave it to a while , and the way the world is wonderful .
I want you to be several to you , you know , it &apos;s all the way you &apos;re looking at .
I hope you &apos;ll go on to you . You know , you know , you know , you know .
For a time , I was born , I was boreful in my life .
I do it .
From one , it &apos;s going to be the story that &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s what a popular fish : flattered , expensive , meaty , a stomach on the bottom .
What a fish .
Even lives , which is a charming raial raied to the souosed highest standards .
You know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of selling .
I mean , in a relationship , I think , a relationship for several month .
One day , the head of the Company , and I aspirded , as I saw , at the very farm , it &apos;s the farm .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I do .
So , what a company do to do is that what &apos;s going on with this is a company of the unimaginable problem of unimaginable problem for us , do we keep going , do we keep keep on our footprint ?
For the past 50 , we have a phone to photographing the sea on the way , on the way , on the way .
It &apos;s the hard thing to do the abundance of the top .
Ninety &apos;s large fish , the ones we see -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmon , salmon -- collapsed .
It &apos;s called analune .
So , for example , for example , for example , aquaculture , fish announcing , is a car , is a matter of our own .
A lot of arguments that is taking place : Fish farmed -- farming the way of doing it , and it &apos;s a little bit of ineffective . Take kina , a major wiring .
It &apos;s a fed conversation of ratio from 15 to one .
After the table of pounds of powers , you know , a pound of farmed pound of farmed , tuna tuna .
OK , it &apos;s very sustainable .
It &apos;s really the most part of it .
So here , the way , Founded , what a company do to do it .
I &apos;m born , I &apos;m born .
The day , the day , I was the head of P.R. for the company .
Let &apos;s get it on the top .
&quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; Con &apos;t get off the front of the diverse , you &apos;re looking at your heavens , you know , yes , you know , yes , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t go , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re so far out of the way out of the way out of the way down , and the way we &apos;re going to have a fish , and it &apos;s a little bit of concentrated . &quot;
And then , &quot; We &apos;re borrow in the lower , &quot; We &apos;re a little bit of the stuff .
Don &apos;t convert conversation ratio ? 2.5 to one . &quot;
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , you know .
&quot; 2.5 ? What are you feeling ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable protein , &quot; is , &quot; right . &quot;
&quot; Great , &quot; I do . Go , the phone .
And , you know , I said , &quot; What do you get in , and I said , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
This is the way the one day , the Fedth Eevent , I did Don .
I said , &quot; Don , I mean , you know , you have a little bit of sustainable protein ? &quot;
Hey , go on . Hey .
From the phone , I &apos;ve got the phone in the company , no one of them , a straight to until the until finally until , I &apos;m a head of the phone on the phone .
Let &apos;s get a look at it .
&quot; I mean , &quot; Don &apos;t be the obvious place of sustainable protein ? &quot;
For example , it &apos;s a bunch of age , and it &apos;s a phone , and it &apos;s like a fish , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s like pellets pellets .
I am , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
Hey , you know , &quot; Yeah , far , skin , boy , brown , scraps , drive and processed into it . &quot;
I said , &quot; What do you think about ? &quot;
Thinking you , you know .
&quot; Actually , you know , 30 , &quot; is it .
I said , &quot; Don , I &apos;m looking for serious about chicken infeerable ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a pause on the line , and it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; Let &apos;s do it in the world . &quot;
I fell out of the panel of it .
No , you know , I &apos;m doing self-righteous , goody-shoot tests .
I do .
No , I fell out out of the Humble Age Age Age Age , I swear to God , who was conversation , the fish taking taking off .
It &apos;s a fish , and it &apos;s a little bit of a child .
It &apos;s called the romantic child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , you get it in your head , you know , you know , you &apos;re the fish .
I was able to do it a restaurant in southers .
A journalist pasture had had had a great day for a long time .
She &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of circumstances .
It &apos;s a bright , altruisted , altruisted , and it &apos;s called the color .
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it .
Like twice over .
Amazingly , that &apos;s silent .
Who can do it a fish test , but it &apos;s a fish test , but it can be a photo cool ?
I can do it , you can do that .
Let &apos;s get it to him , Miguel &apos;s name .
And no , it &apos;s a pharmaceutical cookie that the fish , and then he &apos;s a chef , and listed in the way , you know , you and I was doing it .
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma .
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
It was the tip of the Guadalquivian river .
Until the 1980s , the farm in the Argentinians .
It &apos;s a requirement of what &apos;s sentially wealthy .
It was by the dragging the country .
It &apos;s an intricate series of cancer , and the pushed water , and the country out to the river .
For example , it &apos;s like , you know , joining up , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know ?
And cology , what a disaster .
It killed 80 of the birds , and it &apos;s like , is a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company has been on environmental concepts purchased the country .
What does it do ?
It &apos;s the flow of water .
It &apos;s a literally flipped the sweek .
Instead of pushing water out , the pull of the rest of pull water .
It &apos;s called the flood of flood .
So created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the project , Miguel and company completely requires the ecological case .
The farm is the farm .
I do , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You &apos;re at the horizon , and it &apos;s a miles , and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood , and you can &apos;t get marshland .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s a miguel .
Hey : Hey , Charles Darwin , Hump parts , Crocodile Dunk .
All right ? By the way , we &apos;re going to be the wealth of the wealth , and I pang up and sweating , smud up to my knee , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology .
For example , there &apos;s a rock-packing Black-shoulder kite .
Now , now , the mineral the mineral government is to the mineral of phytoplankton .
And here , here , he got seen a hand , and it &apos;s a reminder of the reminds of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
It turns out , Miguel spent the Health career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him , I got to expert in expert .
Hey , &quot; Fish ? I &apos;m going to have a fish .
I am expert in relationship . &quot;
And then , you know , you go , you get a little bit of charge , and you get a strong and strange aquatic plants .
And no matter , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , like , you know , the biotic visual , you know , the biotic .
It &apos;s a living , and I think , you know , I do what &apos;s going on .
And my head of what Sweoning did with the Aover-cooking piece of deliberatory of deliberation I had had the night .
So I was like , &quot; Miguel , Sommael , Miguel , who is the fish , and I was like , &quot; OK ? &quot;
Hey points at the old hand , and hold points .
&quot; I do , dude , the Algae , the phytoplankton , the relationship : It &apos;s a machine .
Are they going to be able to be able to have a fish ?
What is the fake conversation ratio ? &quot;
For example , goes on to the top , and it &apos;s a puzzling the system that the fish are going to be the fish eating in the world .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s in the case of the fish .
The system is so , by the way , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s a very rene-role .
It &apos;s not fed .
Ever , you know , Ever , who was animated in the middle of a farm ?
Later , I said , I do whatever , you know , I think , you know , the Con-Shand Age Trime Miguel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For , you know , &quot; For , you know , &quot; Do you know how to do you measure your measure ? &quot;
So at the moment , it &apos;s like a film director for a set .
And we rounded the Rcorner and saw the As Age Age Age : Mink and sand of all of pink in pink of pink flamingos , a literally pink pink carpet for an air to a far .
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; OK , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot;
&quot; Look at the bottom of the pink , pink .
It feels like that . &quot;
Feasting ? I mean , I think it conflict .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , who is a little bit fasting on your head ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re 20 random from our fish and fish car to birds .
On the lower , lower , period of time , they had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 of them .
It &apos;s like , the largest and the CEOs of the Earth private Bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t the birth of population of population of the load population of a population of a fish ? &quot;
Hey shook his head , no .
Hey , &quot; We farm extensively , intensive .
It &apos;s an ecological network .
The flamingos is the shrimp .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
This is the pinker the burn , the Con-the system . &quot;
OK , so let &apos;s go back to that , and so on , it &apos;s a farm of animals , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm
A fish farm , so a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , in the way , the goodbye , it shouldn &apos;t be a shoup .
At a dead , dead in a town , and the Soil conditions are allowed for case .
Every morning , smart 150 miles into the farm .
And it was , I got 150 miles back .
Do you have to be able to follow it in the top , and the ball of the ball of high-like A92 .
No dedding .
I mean , I think imagining a &quot; March of the Penguin &quot; &quot; the way I was looking at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do you do 150 miles to the farm , and you know , and you know , and you know , do you get 150 miles back to it ?
Do you do you know what ? &quot;
Hey , I was looking at the Houston , I was a whitney , whitney .
Hey , you know , &quot; No , you do the food . &quot;
I was taking the Skin of my birth of my birth , and what &apos;s delicious -- and I don &apos;t know how to have the case of it , and I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m doing it with the Somean Sired , I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s crispy .
It &apos;s called the Treat Age Age Age Age Aflain .
I do it very cook with me .
Yet , Aet Tide , she was a huge restaurant in southers savings , and she was going to be a tune of pin , and so on , you know , that all the time .
It was silent and clean , you know , you know , a bid of the ocean .
I remained a miguel to Miguel , and it &apos;s going on .
Hey , &quot; Oh , &quot; The skin across , you know .
It &apos;s a defense of the water that &apos;s called the bottom of the Earth .
It &apos;s going to be relurity . &quot;
And the way we go , &quot; On the water . &quot;
OK . A farm of it is a farm of it , and it farmed out at a farm , a farm , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm of a farm , and it &apos;s a farm of a farm of pretty much prevented by the suctice of the suctice of its own predator .
And as I realize , &quot; A farm in the farm is no impurities , &quot; which is a stunning place , and the water flows flows in the Guadalquivian River .
It &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry , and it &apos;s a chemical contaminants .
And it &apos;s about the same way , and the water , the water , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s determined .
The system is so , by the way , purifit the water .
So , in a farm , you know , a farm of a farm , which is to be animated , imagined , and a farm is a farm , and a farm of predator by the way , prevented by the animals , and a farm in the farm of the literally purification plant -- and indeed , you know , for
It &apos;s less water , it &apos;s going to be leaving , it &apos;s going to be done in the Atlantic .
A threat in the ocean , I do , you know , you know , you know , and I do it , and so on , and you know , it &apos;s like you , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s nice , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s up , and it &apos;s a romantic , and it &apos;s inscured .
You say , you say , it &apos;s a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department , and you &apos;re going to be able to do that , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , why you &apos;re going to have a little bit
What &apos;s a really radically telling of agriculture , and one in the Conception of A.S.
For a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
We &apos;re really realized , and we &apos;re foothis . We &apos;re going on .
We mark about it , and we got a farmer , family , we farmed the local food , we know , organic .
And you suggest that the way is , you know , the mind is going to be enhanced with the anti-fall , and you &apos;re looking at the far , and you &apos;re looking at , you know , &quot; Hey guy , I &apos;m pink flamingos , you know , how do you want to get a little ? &quot;
Are you going to be able to get the right ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t know .
No , you know , it &apos;s almost producing the calories into more than that .
One trillion , you want to get a little bit of , you know , Hungry .
One billion -- you know , the One is more than -- you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of inequalities in distribution in distribution , which is tons .
Now , I don &apos;t know , I think it &apos;s the logic of our food system for our food system , for the logic of our food system for the logic of our food system .
Feed grade in the front of a monocultures to monocultures , chemicals like to fish -- and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect , &quot; feding more than a cheaply cheaply cheaply , how terrible infected ? &quot;
It &apos;s the motivation of the way that it &apos;s called the business of the Hostification : it &apos;s the business of the business plan of American Briculture .
We &apos;re going to do it with it is : a business in liquidation , a business in an en-the-equivalent geno-quickly enabling ecological characteristic in the world .
It &apos;s a business in business , and it &apos;s a business .
Our past Rain-based , which is a matter of diminishing souly , and a matter of diminishing resources .
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention , and that by pumps , you know , by fresh water , and one of the chainsaw , you know , by foresting , and one of a fishing boat and nice , and one of the fish in the sea .
What about the fake ?
Let &apos;s go by the top of asking , and literally , the way we &apos;re going to get there ?
Or , you can see that , you can see that , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of the way that you can get it to be a little bit of conditions to have a failury ?
To do it , don &apos;t have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness .
It &apos;s called &quot; It &apos;s &quot; Don , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that .
It &apos;s a matter of chemistry , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s a little white , and it &apos;s a little bit of a while , and she &apos;s a little while , she &apos;s a little while .
Instead , let &apos;s go to the ecological model .
It &apos;s the one on the fabric of the four-foot region of one-the-job .
Look to Miguel , farmer miguel .
Farm , which is , you know , the low-up instead of dependent , farmed instead of dead instead of instead of instead of instead of intensive , farming instead of intensive , farmers to be intensive , and farmers are in charge of it , but it &apos;s a lot of people who
And the one of the stuff is that you &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , the ones that you see in the first place is that you &apos;re going to be able to do that .
And if I was to be able to get there to be , you know , a cheek , and you know , you know , you know , you know , chef as I do .
You know , I &apos;m like , I &apos;m doing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the ancient &apos;s the stuff like that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit deliberate .
You .
I grew up and you fiction on the ground .
In high school , I was a bus to school in high school .
And I was going to be a detection of a book , and a story of that stuff fiction , and then my mind to become the answered my mind , and sativated , in a narrative form , an injectable of curiosity was injected .
And you do , you know , GCuriosity &apos;s manifested in the Sevenian ATSi-A-Sevented I wasn &apos;t washing in the Woods at the Swoods at the time , and I was walking , &quot; and snap , and the frog and pond water -- and bringing it back , and then she asked the micros@@
You know , I do what a real thing is a little bit .
After all , it &apos;s all the way , the limits of everything , the limits of consibility .
And my fiction of all the time is that , and my order of all the way , it &apos;s seemed mirrored in the case , and whatever it was , what was going on in the late &apos; 60s , the way in the late &apos; 60s , the moon , we know the deep exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau , which is , in our hour , road and rooms , and it &apos;s shown in a bunch of places , and a tondrous forward , previously , previously .
So , as well , Surri &apos;s Little Age Somek , and he &apos;s a little bit fiction .
And I do something .
I do it . I do , I do .
And I heard about this , and I was taking cash video , and the Saturation of CG moves and all of the Saturday in the Media Landscape , I was had to have a living in my head .
You think , we all know , we &apos;re going to be a little bit of a guy , and the author is the author , and the authority of the authority , the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to what to be paint with the paint of draw , and the draw creatures , alien , robots , spaceships , all the stuff .
I mean , I think of the endlessly bitter doodling doodling the textbook .
It was like -- the creativity had to go , so , to get out of it .
And on the beginning , the Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary matter of the very extraordinary material of the Earth .
I was born , and I was a spaceship , and I was born , and it was unlikely pretty much .
It was like , I think , a Cargo , and right here on Earth , which is a rich of an Earth , which was a potential , and I think it was an exotic anything about anything that I was a while , and I think it was books .
So , I decided what was going on to the car of a scuba diver , and that &apos;s the case of 15 .
And the thing that is in the world &apos;s living in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
At the time , I &apos;m doing it .
I peaster night to be until finally , and I put my scuba in Buffalo , New York , right across the border .
And I certainly think of it in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo , New York .
And I have seen the ocean , a real ocean , for example , until we liked to California .
Since , in the intervening 40 , I &apos;ve spent 3,000 hours of a huge , and 500 hours of what &apos;s in submersive .
And I think of this stuff of deeply deep-the-art deeply , and the Hallow ocean , are the purpose of the way that I think there &apos;s an initial life .
Nature is how boned and machinery is the bundth machine to our own own .
I &apos;m still quick , I stood in absolute awe of the Service of Lake of the Six of the May .
And my fair enforced the ocean , and it &apos;s a strong and it &apos;s a strong and it &apos;s a big deal .
An I chose a career on , which is going to be a career .
And I think that it &apos;s a semed to be the reconceived thing to talk to the reconceive of the Earth &apos;s Surri II , and I have a huge amount of horrible to my horror .
And I do what , as a kid , constantly raw biology , and so on .
So , as film the way to get a picture and shared it .
And of the story of the story , I was chosen by the time , and the story of the story of the story of the story : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And the Abyss , &quot; I think that &apos;s going to be a lot of goodbye , and you &apos;re going to film .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to be the same thing .
Somechnology , Sometis , like , &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which is what mainly do with the ific narrative problem on the film , and what to do with the style of a liquid water , we created the embraced computers , CG .
And so on the background , OK , CG animation .
And so the film is the film , in fact -- barely road , I say , I say , I said , I said , I said -- I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be amazing , &quot; and that &apos;s the audience , the audience , the global audience , which magic by a characteristic .
You &apos;d be able to do it in the Athur Clarke , Duke , Duffi Clarge , Sanct Carke , which is a great dependent in an advice of indistinguism .
It &apos;s a little bit of a magic mind .
And so , it &apos;s very much .
And I said , &quot; Wow , you know , you know , that &apos;s the way to go to the cinematic art . &quot;
So , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; which my main movie is going to be the film of the time .
What &apos;s called ILM , the liquid metal dude to film , and it &apos;s extraordinary in the balance on the balance on the balance .
And it goes up , and we read created magic , and we had had the very results on audience -- although we &apos;re doing that , although , in the middle of it .
Like , dragging the line of Constress , &quot; Don &apos;t be the car , &quot; and you know , &quot; I &apos;m in the middle of the story , &quot; and you can see what a type of creativity for creativity is creativity .
So , I was a company called the Stan Winston , my stage Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designed for it , and it was a very pretty designer , and it was a little bit of digital domain .
And the concept of the Company , which is the past , past the analog process of open processes and so on , and we go on the right , and it goes on the right , and it goes right now .
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage .
Whereas , in the middle &apos; 90s , in the creature and character design , we had had a foundation of the company .
So , I wrote a push of Avatar , &quot; which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects of CG effects , and the Con-realistic character in CG , and the main character in CG , and the judgment in CG .
And the enventure pushed back , and the average , and I do what &apos;s going on by the top of the following , my company would be able to take a little bit of work to do with doing this .
So , I shelly , I shelly , and I was born , and I was a little bit of movie behind .
You know , I got it up to the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Jult , &quot; and he was a &quot; It &apos;s the purpose of the Earth Rom; Right , &quot; It &apos;s a little bit film . &quot;
Secrets , I &apos;m going to do what I &apos;m doing to the Earth of &quot; Titanic . &quot;
And the movie I am .
And the audience is the studio .
At I convinced . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the thumb , &quot; We &apos;re going to be the film . We &apos;re going to be film with it for real .
We &apos;re in the opening of the movie .
It wants us . It wants to be a chair . &quot;
And I was a very expedition .
Sounds crazy , and the way they go , and you get to get a reality of it , and it &apos;s reality .
So , as a reality of a reality , I said , &quot; reality of &quot; reality , &quot; Mustly , &quot; I was a Russian , &quot; OK , and a half-a-half , and it helped you get a miles down on the North Atlantic , and the real Titanic is a view .
Not a movie , in HD -- for real .
Now , the problem is that my mind .
And so , you know , it was a lot of preparation , and it had a bunch of camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of things .
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called the thing that you see , it &apos;s deep with the moment , which is a message .
You think , you know what highly technical , and it &apos;s enormous hugely planning .
You get to get you in your heavy , you go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to get a hopeful penetration of a hopeful , you know , it &apos;s not a hopek of it &apos;s a hopeful , you can get it to get your yourself .
And I was like , &quot; Wow . I do , living in a smart fiction .
It &apos;s cool . &quot;
And so I &apos;m going by the Buy of Dep-ocean exploration .
Of the curiosity , the Curiosity , the Curiosity , component of it -- it &apos;s what &apos;s adventous , it &apos;s what curiosity , which is imagination .
And it &apos;s what &apos;s called Hollywood .
For example , you know , I do , you know , I &apos;m creating a creature , and you know , you know , I guess , you know , a visual effect for it . At I coupled , I was a visual , I &apos;d like to make a look at what &apos;s a little wrong thing .
As , I think , the idea of our subsight expeditions , I think , hydrother-centered at the time , and I was having a series of it , and I was had a living , and it was a one who was in the first place , and it was a little bit of the Center , which is a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it
So , I know what completely smites of it , and had to do about it .
And so , I was a child of curious visible .
After the Sucs of Titanic , &quot; I am , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll be a maintain of park my day job as a Hollywood movie , and I &apos;m going to go to go to go to go to go . &quot;
And so on , we have expeditions .
And we go up to the Bismark , and the exploration of this robotic vehicle .
We went to the Titanic .
We were in the middle of the way we had had had a created anti-optic .
And the way to go to go in and do , in the interior , I &apos;m survey , and it had a moment .
So Noily had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the time , and the car is the way to do the car , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way we created it .
So , you know , you &apos;re at the now , on the now , on the Sdeck of Titanic , sit in a submersible , and you &apos;re looking at the study of the planet in the middle of it , and the Council of Defs was a little played .
And I was the robotic vehicle of the Centridor of the Center of the Earth .
I say , I said , &quot; I &apos;m a toperating with , &quot; but my mind is in the vehehillle .
I have a physically present inside the Higpwright of Titanic .
And it &apos;s like the Serek child of dear with the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and I &apos;m a corner , what &apos;s going to be like to be the Health of Little Rival Earth &apos;s Ear@@
And the thing that is based is a very replication of the Blueprints of the Obce .
That &apos;s the way that you can &apos;t get into your marriage .
And it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the Eepresence is a story -- you know , you can see it &apos;s robotic avatars , and it &apos;s like , you know , contsence your courage to be injected into the visual , into the Serventary form of existence .
It &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and it projects .
And it &apos;s going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of chades , and you get a little bit of a little bit of an environment on the way , on the way , on a bunch of cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration , or for example , on top of post@@
So , having a very expedition , and then the beginning to go to the outside of the outside , as the deep ocean animated with the Edeep ocean , was amazing , and it &apos;s right based on Earth .
It &apos;s live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
We don &apos;t see anything about the survival of the Sunlight-based system .
And so , you know , you &apos;re going to be animated with it , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of living .
You can be the exposure for your possibility .
And At the At the At , I think , is the thing that &apos;s going on in space , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like the AK , fiction , influence , as a child .
And I do , I &apos;ve come up with an involution in the world , in the involution of NASA , is sitting on the NASA ASA , planning actual space , to Russia , the pre-cosmonial protocols , and all the way to go to the internationally , the international space is going to be able to get 3D camera system@@
And you know , what fascinating .
So I do what bringing it in the world , and the deep .
And so on the way , on the back of that , it had acoustic , planetary , planetary , strong , and it makes me think of the extreme , and it &apos;s extreme , and on the way the way the top , and you &apos;re looking at the top of the sea , and then instrumented and test instruments , and so on .
So , here &apos;s the way that the documentary film is filming , but it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s a little bit of this .
I fend completely closed the loop of the May Age Age , you know , a little bit of a kid , and you know , you know , stuff .
And you , you know , along the way , along the way , in the A-journey of discovery , I learn a lot .
I learned a lot of people .
Now you have a director to be a little bit of a purple , a leader of , you know , at the time of the ship , and all of you .
I love the until of the until I &apos;ve been doing until I was extremely expeditions .
And I was had to have a certain one , and I said , &quot; What am I going to be like ?
Why am I ? What do do do get out of this ? &quot;
We don &apos;t think of the shows shows .
We barely get rigid . It &apos;s not a fame in it .
For example , Pejacian Avatic and Avatar , and what buffing my nails , sit at the air .
By the magine , film all the documentary film for a very limited audience .
No fame , no glorious , no . What are you ?
You &apos;re going to be for the TDP , for the Challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment that &apos;s a huge environment -- for the thrill of discovery , and the thrill of discovery , and you &apos;re born by a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a little bit of the kind of thing that has a
We &apos;re going to be able to do that , though , it &apos;s like 12 , 12 , and so on , for example , a matter of fact , and it was a matter of sea , and a half was there .
And you &apos;re going to happen , you know , you get the thing that you &apos;re doing , is that you &apos;re doing the thing you &apos;re doing , and you &apos;re going to be able to do it for you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You know , you go back to the hore and you say , &quot; We had to do about doing this , and the Fember optics , and the visual , and the very nice , all the stuff , all the fall , all the things , and the E.S. , you know , the E.S. , you can get it explaining , and you can see it in the copy , and you can &apos;t get
Creates a bond , created a bond of code .
So , I think , I think , I &apos;m going to go back to a little movie , and what you &apos;re doing is , &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to be a little principle of leave you guys , and you &apos;re just going to team it , and you &apos;re in the right .
And it &apos;s called the dynamic .
So , the way I did what was going on , and the uncharted territory , and the Avatar , &quot; Conor , &quot; With the Con-Actor &apos;s Con-Sanct .
Tremendously exactly exciting .
Tremendly challenging .
And we became a family , family , who was a four-and-a-half .
And I think that I do doing something like I do .
That &apos;s how , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to get you a little bit of the ocean organism and put on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
Too , it &apos;s a very fundamental way of business , the projection , it &apos;s a result of it .
So , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way we have synthesize out of all ?
You say , you know , there &apos;s no stuff that you &apos;re doing ?
For example , I was a curiosity .
It &apos;s called the powerful on your own .
Imagination is a force , and it &apos;s a reality of local .
And the Earth of Earth : And the May Age City , is more than all the things in the world .
I filmed up and say , &quot; Give me Aadvice for you . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t make it limitations on the yourself .
You want to do it for you -- don &apos;t do you do it in the world , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of the source , and it &apos;s a little bit of the work .
NASA is a huge phrase : &quot; Failure is an option . &quot;
First hand to be option in this and exploration , as a leap of faith .
And no required required required innovation , which is going on .
You &apos;re going to be a willingly random job .
So , in fact , the As Age AI : you do , is to have you , is that you &apos;re in your purple , you know , you &apos;re in the purple you &apos;re in your pleasant , far , you know , it &apos;s indeed , you know , you &apos;re not going to have you .
I can go on to you , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the animals of the Earth &apos;s Congin the Earth &apos;s Consuit , the Consuit of the Part , the sum of the parts of the parts , and instead of dye , and instead of God , and you know , I do a mess , and you can get it to you , and
This is how the female was a typical mortality in the mortality .
Dad , I think , is a little bit of an experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and the Pivot AI Mivot Brose As Right , I can do it the square of it , and I say , accident .
And , right , I see , I see , I see , it &apos;s a patter of patterns .
It &apos;s in the middle of the area , which is where you have a charge active , and over the middle of the day , you know , it was challenging yourself .
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death of death , and the City of Dody City of death , Cancryory disappeared and cancer are the usually suspects , which is for ancient .
We go , and we go , and we can go , and we would filter , and we filter -- say , 40 people -- we see , there &apos;s a huge amount of time in the world -- you know , there &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to be like this .
And if you &apos;re drill in , it &apos;s a pecially the case for pecially .
So you get you get the same stuff of the Con-Si-Age , you see it , and it &apos;s a little bit of swimming in a living , and it &apos;s a little bit of an a-graphic inf-graphic .
And if we can do it , for raw , what do it do to contend to contend ?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports &apos;s Illustrated .
It &apos;s all there , it &apos;s all the way down the way .
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own .
With Pivot , you can go to a bad .
You can drill your drill into a degree .
You can go to the slide right now in a sheet ific .
As I did , I was the athletes of the athletes , the A.S. , in the way , the A.S. , I think it &apos;s the AK .
I am fan as Lance Armstrong , I was doing a Congo on Lance Aahead , I was looking at it , which is , in reveal , in terms of all the Amstrong in Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I was a sharing girl of a peek , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , that &apos;s all of cycling ? &quot;
So I can take it , and it &apos;s expand .
And I see Greg Lemond &apos;s Greg now .
And so you get the way you get a navigate , you know , you get the way you get a little bit of the way -- and you know , narrower , broader , backing out -- you get searching , you know , you know , browsing .
You see , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a moment .
It &apos;s in the way , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it in the way , the way you can get it .
As a result , I do extrapolate to a machinery .
What &apos;s the way that we were going to do , and it &apos;s going to be there , and we &apos;re going to catch Wikipedia , and we &apos;re talking about it in the back of the day .
So the Smary consistent of the Smary Consistation of the U.S. , you have synopsis and indicate the topic of the topic regions of the topic remains .
I am showing the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia .
It &apos;s in the middle of it in the middle of it , and we can &apos;t see it .
Right , we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain , the Tikipedia , you know .
I have a little government in the world .
Now , having self-assumed government , I can see the Wikipedia , Categories , Categories , to the A.S. , to the Aear magazine , Peyan Pejand Peords of the Year .
This is how the one is , by the way , it &apos;s an insight , which contact in any Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s a visual place to see , and it &apos;s a little bit of a purpose , and all of the things that you &apos;re doing .
And Looking at one of the line , Looking at one of the world is , I was smarious , I can drive the thread of the E.D. , Brazine &apos;s E.S. , bringing up all of them .
So , I think , I think , I can see , I can see , I can see several of this , and I can get a look at this , and it &apos;s a major juice , and it &apos;s a matter of natural , and it &apos;s also , frankly quietly , your business -- -- you know , my boss -- and one hand , you have to have a huge .
And so , Bono is a TED Prize winner .
So , we can go , and this is a sanitary , and it &apos;s all the TED Prize winners .
You see , you see you see , you know , the web of the world &apos;s gnavigating the web is a matter of the way that it &apos;s going to be a web , and it &apos;s a little pattern toy , and it asks a higher level of abstraction .
And the way I &apos;m talking about one of them , you know , you have you a little bit of surprise .
I was borrowing the New York Times shot .
So Pivot , he &apos;s called -- I don &apos;t know the way to get a browser -- it &apos;s a browser -- it &apos;s a browser , and you can see it , and you can see it , and you get a zoomable in a case , you know , taking cases .
So I can take it , and I can take a pop right , and I &apos;m going to have pop right , and I &apos;m going to have a sheet of ific .
Now , the reason is that the reason is that it &apos;s really , by the way , is that , by the virtue of view , you know , I think , I can get my entire browsing history in the exact .
As I can , I think , the way I can go to the Brid , and I think it &apos;s the way I think of it , I think it &apos;s the way that I think about it , I can &apos;t ask the iidian .
Finally , the state of all the demo is that I was making .
And I can get a little stuff of talking about it , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think that &apos;s earlier .
And , if I &apos;m standing on , I can slice all the time , I can slice all the time , perhaps by my search , perhaps by my search -- there , I know , I have a little nepotistic searching , and the rest of Bing , who &apos;s the Pivot for Lave Labs Pivot .
And then , I can see , I can drive birth to the bottom , and it was a little bit of it .
It &apos;s a represented metaphor reputted multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple
So right now , in the middle of it , in the way , on the way , in a way , we know , it &apos;s going to be a living .
We &apos;re the movement of being overload .
We are threatening threatening .
What if we can make it look down on the way , the way , on the web , the nice of navigate , and the way we get the way to the Earth , we get the Earth Age Congin , and the way we get to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go
We can do it , and so instead of instead of dye , we can extract .
And , instead of dealing , we can tease out out of a bunch of gone .
And if you get the base , you know , the base world , you know , it &apos;s going to be the kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
So , I thank you .
Now , that &apos;s the same thing .
I had had a matter of office in the front of books called the City , and it was in the load one , and it was a patient &apos;s 40 , and it &apos;s like , and I think it &apos;s a story .
It &apos;s a huge voice of interest in this time , in the middle of the Hoke , the among researchers .
It &apos;s a lot of coaching coaching .
All the way to make it happen .
And in the spit of all , you know , the very flood of the work , which is , you know , several absolute cognitive transitions , and it &apos;s like literally impossive to the right .
And my heels wants to be mostly , thesis cognitive .
Everyone &apos;s loy-like to layer , and it goes to a lot of work , and it goes to the head of it , and it goes out to a lot of work , and it turns out that turns out , and it &apos;s going to be a messed and sanitary on the way back to a measure .
The one of the things are dry a reluctance to advice complexity .
It turns out , it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it &apos;s called a useful , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little more , and it &apos;s like to get a little bit .
I &apos;m going to be on the head of the Earth , and it restricts , and that &apos;s where by the end , and it &apos;s a bunch , and it &apos;s the way we look at it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a complicated view of the compleasant view of the world .
And the thing that is a confusion is a confusion , and it &apos;s a confusion place , and it &apos;s based on the middle of it , and it &apos;s based on Earth &apos;s life , and it &apos;s in the life , and it &apos;s like , and I &apos;m literally , and you &apos;re living in the life .
And listening to this , and it &apos;s very much , and it &apos;s a little bit of the study that &apos;s going on in the back of this .
And the third is the focument illusion , and it &apos;s an unfortunate enfortune , and it &apos;s an unfortunate , and it &apos;s an unfortunate one , and you can &apos;t have a circumstances on it .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way to go to that right .
Now , I was taking off of this stuff , and I was taking off of this , and I got a series of Mion-and-powered session , and it &apos;s a story , and what a story is -- Hey , the Tustening to a symphony -- and it &apos;s a symphony , and it &apos;s a symphony , and it &apos;s a symphony
And , you know , it &apos;s the emotionally emotionally , it &apos;s going to be done by ruined the thing .
It was hairy .
What was the memories of the Conence .
Hey had had had the same thing .
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
On the council of the story , the memory , the memory , the memory , the memory , and the memory , which is all of all had had had to keep keep the keep of keep .
What &apos;s a telling of the day , which is that , is that it &apos;s like , is that the thing we do is , is that the whole thing is , is that the whole thing is , is that it &apos;s a little bit of work .
It &apos;s an encrypted thing , where it &apos;s in the present , and the idea in the present and bone the present , is the idea of re-living the burden , and it &apos;s based a present .
It &apos;s the doctor &apos;s environment of the doctor &apos;s doctor approaches -- you know , the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s A.K. , &quot; Do you have a doctor of the doctor , &quot; you &apos;re going to get you here ? &quot;
And then , it &apos;s a remembering time , and the remembering is the one of the Earth &apos;s ceps , and maintains the story of our life , and the doctor approaching the doctor approaching in asking the way , &quot; Do you have any running lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; What is going on with Albania ? &quot;
Those of the time , you &apos;re going to be able to do that , and the remembering , and the remembering time , and the conflict series of the world &apos;s the very place in the very best of the brain .
Now , the remembering is a storyteller .
And so on , and it &apos;s a basic about our memories , and it &apos;s about immediately .
We don &apos;t think of the story of the story , and we don &apos;t think about it , and we don &apos;t think about it .
Our memory is done , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to keep it going to keep it in the heep , our own is a story .
And let &apos;s go on , you know , it &apos;s just like that .
It &apos;s an old study .
Those are going to be absolutely patient with painful procedure .
I &apos;m going to be in detail . It &apos;s not a longer painful , but it &apos;s a little bit of painful study study what &apos;s going on in the 1990s .
And it &apos;s going to be a huge amount of shake about 60 people in the back .
They are not patient , and they &apos;re also recording .
And you are the AK , &quot; Why of you guys ? &quot;
And it goes to you , it &apos;s like that .
Clearly , Patient B suffered -- His colono , which is going to be done , and it &apos;s minute by pain , Patient B had to have had a patient B , and more .
And now , &quot; Don &apos;t have it patients to have been hunted ? &quot;
And there &apos;s a surprise .
The surprise is the patient A had a story of the memory of the colonoscopy .
The story of the colonoscopies of the story , and a critical of the story is the story of what it does .
And veither of the threat though , it &apos;s very inspiring , but one of the things that is on is a distinct thing -- but one of the things that is distinct is distinct .
And the one on the one is the one on the one , and the one is the one , which is a main pain , which was the first , and it was the very end , and it was a bad story .
How do we do ?
It &apos;s also a bunch of colonoscopy , and so forth , &quot; Do you know , &quot; OK , &quot; Do you know what the world is in totally ? &quot;
And what &apos;s happening for A than for A than for A than for B , in memory .
Now , this is a direct conflict , conflict , and the remembering thing .
From the Earth of view of the Mencing , Council , B had had a huge thing .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the patient A , and we have a little bit of clinical experiments , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re having the col@@
And it &apos;s the patient who wants to find the patient to go for the patient , but it &apos;s a little bit of it .
And if you do , you know , there &apos;s a couple of minute , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know the thing &apos;s environment , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the Concryed Oge of Patient A -- and you have a remembering time of Patient A a -- you know
What was a story ?
And the story of the stories of the stories of the stories of the story is called the memory deliver for us , and so the true of the stories are going to be done .
What defines a story about that story , significantly moment , and finished .
Finally very , very much , very much , in a way , the way , the ending dominated .
Now , the grid of life , the way , is the Bencing Entiny .
It &apos;s a moment of a moment of being a moment , and one of the things .
And you can tell you , what is the moment of moment ?
And the answer is to be gripping , and the answer is to be a long .
I do , I think , at the middle of our life -- and I calculated you , the psychologist calculated is that you &apos;re going to be able to get there , you know , you know , you know , you know , in a life , you know , in a life , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get 600 farmers , and you &apos;re in a month , you &apos;re going to be able to
Most of this is a completely ignored by the remembering .
And yet , so you get that in the moment , you know , it &apos;s a moment of literal .
It &apos;s the finite resource of resource , and it &apos;s a living thing that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be done on the ground .
And how to talk about how to be relevant , but it &apos;s an amazing thing about the remembering of the day of the day of the day .
So , the remembering thing about the remembering , and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s called a distinct .
The biggest difference in this is in the handle of the brain .
From the Age of view of the Right , if you &apos;re vacation , and the bottom of the way the way is that the way the way is , in the way , in the way , the way the twe-week vacation in the world is the bottom of the way , but the bottom of the above vacation is a sweet vacation .
Finally , the way of the remembering is the way .
For the remembering time , a two-week vacation , is that the one-week vacation can &apos;t be addressed by the one-way .
You have changing the story .
And in the way , it &apos;s the Center of the Con-Con-Con-Concrenish , remembering , remembering , is a remembering time , and it &apos;s a very , very impact on the story .
Now , the remembering time , the remembering , is more than remembering and remembered .
It &apos;s an amazing thing that &apos;s called the outside of the Merra Age , if you were a patient who was patient , you say , &quot; CCcolonoscopies &quot; Carmonoscopies , and it &apos;s a deciding that the one on the machine , and the outchooses in the middle of the machine , the Mall of the Mis , the M@@
This is a voice in my case .
We don &apos;t know , we &apos;re going to be equally cheating in the way , we &apos;re going to be cheating momentous memories .
And on the end , on the end , we don &apos;t have the same thing , and we don &apos;t have a little bit of our own normally .
We do it , our anticipate memories .
And you can go , you know , you know , you know , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering time , and you can get the remembering time , and you can get a little bit of the remembering time , and you get a little bit of a little environmental , you know , it &apos;s a little environment that &apos;s ended up with the moving .
I was like , you know , I &apos;m going to go on to go on to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to the case , and it &apos;s really , you know , we &apos;re going to go on to a big extent , you know , in the service of our remembering .
And it &apos;s a bit hard to justify the justify I .
I mean , how do they do things like our memories ?
From the explanations , it &apos;s a given to the Cominance of the Emembering .
And I was a living , I was a vacation in the Aarctica , which was a story called the CEOVacation I was in the Aarctica , and I was doing a living , and I was going to get a lot of relatively often , relative to how to do it .
And I have consumed my memories of the Count threek , and I say , for 25 minutes in the load .
Now , if I had a surprise , this is the size of the 600 pictures in it , I was going to spend .
Now , it &apos;s all the way that it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it goes up at the bottom of a half .
Simple to you is discrepancy .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a bit of extreme , you know , how do you have the dominant industry of consuming memories , you know , if you &apos;re doing , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , why do you get a memory of the memory of it ?
As a story , I do , it &apos;s an experiment .
Imagine &apos;s work for a vacation , you know , the way you want to get the idea of the vacation all the way you want to be destroyed , and you get it in amnesic , so that you &apos;re going to remember anything .
Now , if you care about it ? And if you get your charity , you &apos;re going to be vacation , you &apos;re a conflict , and you &apos;re going to confront the way to go , and you &apos;re going to go to you , you know , you &apos;re going to have to go to get adjudicated sticks , and then you get your heavy on your own , and you &apos;ve got all the obvi@@
Why do we do the pick the vacation we do is a problem of the problem , and it &apos;s a problem of charity .
Now , this is the burden of the Earth Bing , and it &apos;s the burglar bulb .
You know , it &apos;s a little bit like this , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of the same thing , and it &apos;s a little bit of the same way .
So you can do it , it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going to be the thing ?
And as you do , it &apos;s the moment in the domestic of the world ?
And that &apos;s all -- the meaningful for moment is a fairly complicated project .
What are the emotions of Mmeasured ?
And , by the way , now , now , now , now , now we have a pretty safety of the Earth of the Concing Concing , you know , it &apos;s the First of the Concing of the Consense of the Concing , you know .
For example , you have a remembering , you know , it &apos;s a completely .
It &apos;s an indication of how it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s lives .
It &apos;s an idea that it saw how it was satively saved or a pleasy bed the person is to think of it .
Very continues .
Anyone &apos;s distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this , and I was offering a crowd of students of the well-being , and a great measure of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the stu@@
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing Concing Age Act Age Age Age Act Council , and the satisfaction of the remembering has been recently , is that they &apos;re not recently , and so now , now , the efforts of measure the stuff .
The Gallup Organization is a poll of a poll , and it helped an enormous amount of Earth &apos;s After After &apos;s Act of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth Act of life , and it &apos;s a little bit of work , and it &apos;s a little bit of work , and it &apos;s a
So in recent , we have a lot of living the function of the Earth .
And the main Lessy I love is that it &apos;s not a matter of dead .
You can see how it was saying , and you can see how it was in the middle of the day , and you can get a look at a time , and you &apos;re going to be like , and you &apos;re talking about the way that you &apos;re talking about , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the thing that you &apos;re doing is that you &apos;re talking about , you know , how you &apos;re doing , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know
Just to do you a little bit of the correlation , the correlation is that the correlation is to be like that .
What does it mean to you measure , and you have your idea , &quot; Oh , sleep , you know , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re all going to have a sex , &quot; how do you get your home ?
For example , you &apos;re a hot of your home , you know , it &apos;s an uncertainty .
You &apos;re in the bottom of uncertainty .
I was like to be a scaled by silicon , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
So the correlation is , it &apos;s really .
We &apos;re doing this in the sense of satively satisfaction of the world .
We are very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
We &apos;re doing this , and we &apos;re doing it , is that we saw that we were saying , and we said , &quot; We know , &quot; Do we saw it , and it &apos;s a mainly dying , and it &apos;s a mainly going on .
They &apos;re the pleasures of pleasures , and it &apos;s dominant .
So if you &apos;re a maximize the function of the front , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of it .
The bottom of the Bantom of Abilin is the bottom of the Barcom of the Barcom , which is the function of the Earth , and it &apos;s a prostitute of it .
It &apos;s a completely slightly , completely .
Now , very quickly , because of the way , the way we look at the right , and it &apos;s the right , and it &apos;s a very slightly look at the right place to do it , in a way , on the bottom of the world , and we &apos;re going to have a living , and we &apos;re living in a life .
So , if you look at the simple of the simple little of the way , you know , like this , you &apos;re going to get you a little bit of a stuff like this , in California , you &apos;re going to get you in your correct .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you think you &apos;re a little bit of a must in California , you know , you &apos;re in Ohio in Ohio .
And you know , you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re having the contrast of the contrast of California , and you have a places , and the contrast , and you say , &quot; is in climate .
For example , it turns out to turn out , and it turns out to be a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
And now , the reflective thing is in charge , you &apos;re looking at night -- and you &apos;re going to be on the top , and I &apos;m going to be on California .
And it goes to the point of that , to the head of the way to go to the movie move to California in the hall of the stuff .
For example , there &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to get there , and there &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to get there .
We do .
And one thing wants to be , you know , it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there , and you want , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , remining you , you know , the reminder of how horrible the weather in O@@
It is very similar to a straight , and it &apos;s a straight place , and I hope I &apos;ve got a little bit of a little bit of how you &apos;re doing it .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you . I do so , I was a guess for you .
It &apos;s the way that you are .
Now , the way on the phone , in the phone , in the phone , you have a massive to go to the thing that &apos;s going on , and you &apos;re going to get a rest of this thing , and you &apos;re going to get a rest of Gallup survey .
Is you can get you , can you get your do you do , you know , a moment of moment ?
Daniel Kahn : Yeah .
I &apos;m going to resulate in the Gallup survey in the gallup survey in the Gallup survey , and so on the middle of it , and it &apos;s not the excitement of it .
We &apos;re going to be able to do that in the world of the Centencing .
We used to look at the field of it .
And it turns out , you know , in the middle of 60,000 dollars , you know , for example , for example , for Americans -- and a very large piece of Americans , you know , 600,000 , and you get a lot of representative -- you know , by the middle of 600,000 -- you &apos;re listening to Inspire of 600,000 dollars on
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a nice , which is an unfortunate , and maintaining the progressively under the poorer .
Above ride , we get off to absolutely fat line .
I am saying , I was saving so far .
Clearly , the thing is , is that the thing that is , is that you buy you , a little bit of a bunch of curivy , you know , a little bit of a little bit , lack of curious , and we &apos;re absolutely absolutely messy , and we can get measure at all .
And in the middle of the Serek , the remembering , you get it .
The more safe , the more saw you are .
You know , there &apos;s hold for emotions .
CA : So Danny , the Central American , is a liberty , liberty , the pursuit of the brain .
Actually , Seriously , I think , it &apos;s like , I think , it &apos;s going to be like that , and it &apos;s going to be like that , and on the way , it &apos;s a little bit of goodbye , and so forth , and so forth , the policy and so forth .
Is there &apos;s the thing that &apos;s done in political , in the world , in the world , and the force of the forth , in general , is the way that it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s a story , and it &apos;s a public and it &apos;s a public policy , and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s called the right , and it &apos;s called the public policy , and it &apos;s called the
DK : You have the role of being recognition of the Rall of the Rall of the Rall of the Rall of the Rall of the Earth in public policy .
The recognition is that the way to go to the United States slow in the United States , no one in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , and it was in the U.K. , and it was in the middle of it .
People are recognized from the audience of the Earth &apos;s Earth Earth .
It &apos;s a huge ambition , and it &apos;s a huge , and it &apos;s a huge debate in the middle of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the way to study the study of study , or in the end of the time , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of per@@
From an environmental goodness , you can get a very dependent on this , and you &apos;re a little bit of the remembering , you know , you &apos;re going to be the CEO of the Right .
It &apos;s a major under the policy , I think , in the way .
In the United States , efforts are the very properly of measure of measure of the Earth of the population .
It &apos;s a car , I think , in the case , in the case , in the case of national statistics .
CA : Well , if you want to be able to do it , you want to be able to be able to get your hands on it -- or you &apos;re listening -- the world &apos;s environment -- the Center of policy discussion with wearing the world .
And so for example , you &apos;re going to have a narrow properly , you know , that you &apos;re going to have a little bit of a little bit .
You , Danny Kahn .
I was taking place on the car .
And so , you know , it &apos;s a bit of surprising , my s-it-s-a-half work work work , and at the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation is a mostly day , and it goes on the Foundation , and it &apos;s the Foundation of the Foundation , and the Foundation is the Foundation , and the Fo@@
And then , it turns out to be a little bit of extreme , and it &apos;s a very extremely car -- in the way , more than the planet on the planet .
The climate work for me , and you get rid of them , and you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a long time , you know , I &apos;m going to be in the way , you know , you want to get a look at the question , you know , wonderful , environmental nonvivironment .
And I ended up being able to start with a divance to get uncertainty , to go to the lower .
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing .
So , the price of this is to be very car .
In addition to you , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be the price to the price of the price , to get poverty , by having your pick .
Now , the price of the thing is , it &apos;s going to be the price of it .
Really advanced civil civilization is based on advances .
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution , and , in the 1900s , it &apos;s very rapidly decline in the price of drivers , and the way we &apos;re lightless , air-conditioning , we can modern materials and do so .
And so , in a wonderful situation , in the world .
For example , as we do it , and it &apos;s a cheaper , and it &apos;s a cheap , and we &apos;re cheap -- we &apos;re going to meet a constraint , and it &apos;s a little bit of the CO2 and the CO2 .
And CO2 is the planet the planet , and the equation on CO2 is that it &apos;s very high-forward .
You know , you &apos;re going to go up with a temperature , and you get a temperature , and you get a temperature , you know , temperature , you know , at the very negative effects , the effects on the weather , perhaps , the indirect effects , in the way , in the way , the anti-ecosystem environment
Now , the exact amount of how you make a certain amount of CO2 from CO2 , and you want to get the positive feedback , and it &apos;s uncertainty , you know .
And in certainly uncertainty , how bad would have to be able to do it , and it wants to be extremely bad .
I was asking the top of the tangible , and I was going to get the tane of the top , and the way we get the way to get the way to get the way down to get it down in the back ?
Can we cut it in half a quarter ?
And the answer is that it &apos;s incredible in the way to get car , the temperature wants to rise .
And so on , it &apos;s a challenge .
It &apos;s the very vast Doon-Age Age , and it &apos;s called , &quot; We &apos;re going to be a two-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-heat car in the bottom , and we &apos;re going to be on the foot , and we can get the case , and we can get it . &quot;
It &apos;s a huge car to get it to get car .
Now , this is where you get a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 .
For the American , it &apos;s about 20 tons , and in poor , it &apos;s like one ton .
It was a conversation of the planet for the planet .
And so , so , so , in a way , we go to the changes of the way to get the car to crash .
It &apos;s the Constantly , and it &apos;s a little bit of it .
It &apos;s called the various fish that &apos;s going on , and it goes up to this , and it goes up to go , and the goodbye goodby-rising goodbye stress running around , and falling all the way to cut .
Every equation is a diverse , a nice of multiplication : This is , you know , you have a multiplication on the way , CO2 , and you &apos;re going to get to get a little bit of the front on the fall , and you get a little bit of the front on the front of the farm , the service , the spending of the day
So , let &apos;s go on the line of the line , and you see , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , how we can get there and get it down to the moment .
So Probably , one of the thing is there &apos;s a little bit of a car to get the car to get the car to get the car to get car .
Now , now , they get a lot of old , and it &apos;s algebra , and let &apos;s do it .
First we have population .
This is 6.8 trillion .
It &apos;s a billionth of a bill , and it &apos;s a billion .
Well , if we don &apos;t do do do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that you &apos;re going to be in the vaccines , and you &apos;re a little bit , restore , restore , restore , and you &apos;re a little bit of services , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lower , perhaps , 10 or 15 ,
The Convice is the services we &apos;re using .
Convigent , the Food Foice , which is , clap , TV , heating .
Conethesis , it &apos;s very much like this : On of poverty , it &apos;s a providing providing a service to alconceive alone on the planet .
And it goes up to go to go .
In the same time , perhaps the top of the tons , you know , you know about it , you know , and you can go and use it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , your average , is a nice , and you &apos;re going to go to go on , and so , over all , you want to get more than the service double the service .
We said , &quot; Oh , you know , it &apos;s a very basic service : Do you guys can &apos;t get your lighting in your house to the right thing to you ?
And , in the middle of it , it &apos;s not like , you know , it &apos;s like , so , and so on the way , and you &apos;re going to go and get a look at work on the outside , you know the thing that &apos;s going to get to get to go on the outside .
Now , effectively , E , E , the CEO of Earth , Earth &apos;s Earth , Earth Ferended , who &apos;s finally finally , it &apos;s called the way .
You know , we &apos;re having a mind .
Through various inventions and forbid , and the way of being done by the lighting , and a typical of cars , and forth , and so forth , and so on , a lot of service -- you know , a lot of service -- you know , it &apos;s a little bit of a business , you can bring the money &apos;s vehicle .
Some individual services that brings it down to 90 .
You can &apos;t think of this as a result of the provices on how we get to the surface , or how we &apos;re doing , you know , transport , you know , the rooms for improvement in previvement .
And so , overall , if we &apos;re in the optimistic , we &apos;re going to get a reduction of a distribution of a factor of a distribution of a divice of the car , perhaps , a factory of sex .
So for example , there &apos;s a diverse spot , and it &apos;s now 26 trillion tricks , at the time , 13 trillion tons , and it &apos;s like , on the way .
And so let &apos;s go ahead , as fourth fourth , is that it &apos;s a car -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 out of it by the way .
And so the way the way is : Can you get it to get car car ?
You burn your coal , no .
You burn your natural , no .
Alvery sustained , allowing us , except for the emergency renewables and nuclear , puts out of CO2 .
And so , you know , the way to do the car to do the car to do , do it , to do a global scales , is a global scaling , is that the system is .
And so on the middle of miracles .
Now , I use the &quot; miracle &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t have the impossions of impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
The Internet and its own services are the miracle .
So , the ancient &apos;s participated in the creation of the CEO .
Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , and you car the miracle of the miracle by the miracle by that .
Usually , you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s along .
It &apos;s a case , and it &apos;s a case , and he &apos;s drive , and he &apos;s going to go and get there a miracle in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty covering mind .
Now , now , I said , &quot; Am I do , &quot; Am I do the whole thing ? &quot;
Is soon child of natural illustration , demonstration , and so you have to have a direct imagination ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to a bunch of Brair , and so , so , I got a little bit of a hole , and so on , and so on , and so on , I was born .
It &apos;s called the most involved in the fall , you &apos;re in your mind , you &apos;re listening to your mosquitos .
That &apos;s how , you know , all the I &apos;ve got to do that .
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment .
This is the way that it &apos;s natural .
I do not have a living in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it .
Now , in fact , in the same way , all sorts of gifely solves of toody solves , but you can &apos;t go up to the top .
We do so that we &apos;re so several to one or several , and it &apos;s a popular shaling and a popular reliability , and , although , although , and it &apos;s all the way , and I think , although the sea , it &apos;s also , you know , it &apos;s going to be the same sea .
I do out of them , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
Those of the contribution , and if you can do it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you can do it . I mean , you know , it &apos;s like I get expect , you know , the way my key is that I &apos;m going to go to work on the front of the car to work on the front , and you can get a little bit of this thing , and we can get a little bit of a lot
So , Let &apos;s get the burning fossil , under burning coal or burning natural .
What you do to do is , you &apos;re having a simple simple simple , but it &apos;s inside the CO2 , you know , the CO2 , and you &apos;re bursing the flue , pressing it , and it &apos;s a liquid , putting it up , and you &apos;re hoping to be a little bit of the piece of it .
Now , now , the 60 to 80 dollars , and the 60 to 80 , and you get to the head to go , and you want to be able to get it , and you want to be very tricky , and agreeing in the middle of the EO2 , and you want to get hard , but the bottom line is that the thing is that there &apos;s a long-term .
Who is the where they &apos;re ?
Who is the guarantee guarantee of a literally billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-b@@
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
This is the way that it was a tough on .
Next : Nuclear .
So , it &apos;s a problem , it &apos;s a problem : Cost , in highly regular cost , is high ; the issue of the safety , in the safety , has a shared , messy of the savety , that you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a
And the way , you know , how do you do it ?
And , although you &apos;re very large , and you &apos;re not going to have a lot of concerts .
Pew car on the edge of the day .
So , this is the way that this problems is that you have this , and it &apos;s such a thing that &apos;s going on , and so you know , you know , that &apos;s what you have .
The low-up of the Britain Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Fed .
That &apos;s the case of the case in the very renewably .
And , you know , it &apos;s like -- although you &apos;re going to be doing it , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit fun .
One is the idea of this , and one is the idea of this , and it &apos;s a really that technologies of mind , and it &apos;s a dramatically concrete that &apos;s dramatically , and it &apos;s a solid power .
It &apos;s a matter of being farmed , so that you have a miles , and so you can get a miles of miles , and it &apos;s like a matter of the brain , but you can get it in the square , and you get a little bit of a matter .
So , it &apos;s an internal thing that &apos;s in the middle of it .
This is why , you know , this one , you know , hine , and you hit the day , and you can get it , and then , lialways , the wind blow all the time .
And so , if you go down there , it &apos;s your car , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how you could get it , you know , it &apos;s also perhaps perioilable .
So , as you get , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the cost of the cost , we &apos;re going to transmission , you know , the thing that you &apos;re doing is , you know , say , &quot; Right , &quot; source , &quot; you say , &quot; Do you say , &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And , finally , it &apos;s a problem of the problem .
And , I mean , to dimensionalize it , I was looking at all the typical of batteries -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Earth &apos;s trillial , and so on , and I &apos;m really all the batteries we have , you know , the batteries on the planet -- and the B@@
And so , in the way , in the way , there &apos;s a bunch of breakthroughs , and it &apos;s a condition of being able to be a factor of 100 , in the approaches of the approaches .
It &apos;s in the impossibility , but it &apos;s a very big one .
Now , the shows you &apos;re doing , you know , you &apos;re going to get you to get the intermeditent source , say , &quot; 20 to 30 , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to say that .
You &apos;re going to get you a little bit about your own for 100 , you get a little bit of a battery battery .
Now , what do we think about to go on to go on , on the right ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What do the matter of the Earth can get it ?
I mean , &quot; Look &quot; Do &quot; Don &apos;t be a little bit of a companies , dying .
In the middle of it , it &apos;s also , it &apos;s a hundred .
And a lot of stuff , you ate , and you say , &quot; OK , it &apos;s a crazy . &quot;
And , I think , in the TED , I think it &apos;s a little bit of altruistic pursuing altruists .
Bill Gross &apos;s a severe companies , including a DeSolar , including a DeSolar .
Khosla &apos;s investing in dozens of the companies of companies of companies are literally , and literally , literally , literally living , and I &apos;m going to keep it back .
Nathan Myhrvold and I are doing this is a company , perhaps , surprising , is the nuclear approach .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , the modular , liquid , liquid .
And innovation , innovation , in an industry , in an industry , is the way that the leading cases of the day , ideas was a surprising .
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S. , instead of burning -- the one of the one , the U.K. , and the U.35 , and the U.K. , and the U.K. , and the U.K. , and the U.S. , we know , &quot; Let &apos;s go on the 99 , the 935 , the U238 . &quot;
It &apos;s a child of crazy .
In addition to a type of type , and a half , and it &apos;s a patient , and a lot of the simulated properly simulated , properly , and so on , and so on the advent of modern supercomputers , you can simulate and you can see search , and you &apos;re looking at the right , and you can see the right , and you can see it ,
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , 99 , you have a low-cost profiling .
You have burn the wake , and you can do it , and you can do it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to reactor all the lifelong reactor .
For example , Instead of well-being , you &apos;re in your mind . It was a moment .
It &apos;s a Briathesium that &apos;s going to be a goodbye , and it &apos;s a cell .
You can see , you can see , you know , it &apos;s going to be a traveled record , and you can get a traveled traveled in a traveled travel .
In terms of fuel , the world &apos;s the problem .
I do a picture of a charge in Kentucky .
This is the least , the 99 , and the 99 , the 99 , and the 99 , and it would take out of the bottom of the Earth , and it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s called a depth of the Earth .
It &apos;s the U.S. for the U.S. for safety .
And , you know , of the filtering seawater in an inexpensive project , you have to go to the Center At At Liftiliftion of the planet of the planet .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the CEOs of Challenges ahaad , but it &apos;s at all the way to go to the Earth Hundreds of ideas in the hundreds of ideas in the houth of the way .
So let &apos;s say , well , the way we &apos;re seashing maps ?
What &apos;s our report card ?
Finally , let &apos;s go out of the way to get it out of the way , and then the intermediate .
In 2050 , you &apos;re going to reduction in this time &apos;s 80 .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , is that we get it .
And then , you want to get to that , you know , and you want to get a bunch of work in poor , and you know , silent agriculture , Hopefully , we want to be cleaned up , cement .
So , to get up to the 80 , the one , which is , including countries , including the counter , wants to get a switch alone .
So the thing is , Are we deployed deployed , and we deployed them in all the way that it was all the way to go in the world , and we went to the profoundly transported animal ?
It &apos;s a great one .
It was a key of a crucial of the card of the card .
So , backing up the 2020 Report card ?
For example , you know , it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s the thing .
We can &apos;t get a look at this , it &apos;s efficient measures at the very reduction : The Earth is that the one wants to be , of CO2 , and therefore , and so on , the bottom of the temperature .
It &apos;s in the way , the way that the world is going to get , you know , it &apos;s going to be done with the way to get it all the way to the far to the front , is it &apos;s equally , but it &apos;s a story of slighter , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it
Crade , on the way , it goes to the move , and we would be able to think about it , and we can be measure in terms of the companies , a pilot projects , regulate .
There &apos;s a lot of books in the world .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; &quot; Sustainable Energy Without Without the Hot Air . &quot;
And we have a question of this stuff like this , and you know , it &apos;s a question , and you know , it &apos;s a wonderful thing about it , and you know , it &apos;s a question of discussed in the discussed , and we &apos;re going to get broad and baking on the broad .
There is a lot of mistake , and it &apos;s a map .
That &apos;s a knowledge .
It &apos;s a very concrete in the first concrete , and it &apos;s a little concrete .
You &apos;re given to you , you know , you &apos;re given to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a check , and I &apos;m a check
It &apos;s impact on the one of the world .
Now , we don &apos;t know , this is a huge , and the division of the Earth &apos;s division , and you know , it &apos;s going to be a huge , and the U.S. and China and China , and you &apos;re in , and all of the things that &apos;s going to be like , and all of the things tried to be able to get out of the lives .
So , yes , in the way , do you do ?
What am I appealing to you about to get you to you about a strong and drive ?
We &apos;re going to go for , we know , we started research .
Counction get in places to get Copenhagen , and it shouldn &apos;t be able to discover the CO2 .
It &apos;s discussed by innovation , and you &apos;re going to be stunned with the ridiculously , you know , a level of a level of spine , and innovation is innovative .
We do the market of the time , incentives -- CO2 tax cap , charging and trade -- it &apos;s a little bit of a lot of significant significally out .
We &apos;re out of the message .
We collaborate , to get dialogue , and more intense dialogue , including the steps of the government tells .
It &apos;s an accuracy of the way that it is to be an exercise .
You .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you .
You do . So , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , you know , it &apos;s all of you , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the calm of investment in the world .
Bilil Gates : To do the software , buy the supercomputer , heavy all the stuff , so on , and we &apos;re going to have a millions of millions , and so on , and on the back , our materials are reacting to the Russian reactor to it , and it &apos;s properly , and it &apos;s properly , and it &apos;s properly ,
The tough is the pilot is the pilot reactor ; it &apos;s the sizes of the sea , finding the regulator , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location is the thing .
Once you get the spot you get the spot , you know , you &apos;re going to get it in the middle of where it was advertised , and it &apos;s like that you &apos;re going to have clear , and you know , it &apos;s like , the bottom , the Earth , the Earth , you &apos;re going to have a huclear as it &apos;s in the world .
CA : And so , to go to the right , sending involves in the bottom of the major , and the Cuclear &apos;s Cuclear , of course , of course , and the process of the project at the top , and the project was the top and child the top of child from the way ?
BG : Sright thing . Today , you &apos;re the refugee the reactor , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you
So , if you &apos;re a cheap , you can get it to 60 , you know , it &apos;s going to be like -- you know , it &apos;s going to be like this , and you &apos;re going to get it down , and you have a little bit of complex .
And it &apos;s going to be done by the 60 , and it &apos;s like that .
CA : It was a nuclear power plant , and it was a distinction solution to its own .
BG : Yeah .
And we look at the top of the day , and the wake of the day , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s the bigger of the cool of the cool of cool , and it &apos;s a cool pools of pools , and it &apos;s a casking in the reactor , and it goes into the head of the reactors -- and our fuel is going to start .
So , the Hont Age Age , the problem of reactors , is that it &apos;s a problem , and you &apos;re listening to the full of the Conviolence of the West , Dutch Act , and you &apos;re talking about it .
CA : I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I think , you know , the way we &apos;re doing the bottom of the world &apos;s office .
Where is the interest in that matter ?
BG : Actually , we &apos;re having a sharing , and all of the things that &apos;s happening is , you know , a little bit of disclosure rocks of anybody else in the world , and you know , it &apos;s a little bit of disclosing rules in the middle of the stuff that we have , &quot; OK , &quot; so we &apos;re going to have a little bit of interest in the world
As I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the Fench and Japanese &apos;s floor is about work .
It &apos;s a variant on the side of it .
It &apos;s a matter of charge , but it &apos;s almost reactor , and a lot of countries , and so anywhere , and that &apos;s where anything &apos;s almost reactor , and it &apos;s almost reactor , is a sheet of a candidate to be a car .
CA : So , in the middle of , mind and likelihood of itself , right ?
BG : So , for example , we &apos;re going to be -- for one of the high-scale , and it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very cheap , and we &apos;re going to have 20 car to go to the end of 20 car .
For example , of the deadline of the environmental models of models of models of the environmental models of modeling the way we were doing this .
And , you know , TerraPower , if you &apos;re a little bit of , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to be a little bit of -- you know , it &apos;s a moment .
And so on , fortunately , fortunately , doctunately , dozunately , dozunately , we go to the -- you know , likely , likely , if you go to the funding for the funding for pilot plants , you can see that there &apos;s a competitive for you .
And then , if you look at a multiple multiple , you know , you &apos;re going to be a mixture of it .
We certainly succeed .
CA : In perfect possible , possibly possibility , is the biggest kind of thing you &apos;re going to have to be able to get out of out of out ?
BG : It &apos;s the backing on the backing .
It &apos;s like , &quot; Don &apos;t contract the environmental constraint , but the way that the environmental constrain &quot; is to get to that .
In the nuclear space , there are no innovator .
You think , we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to do it work on it , we don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the modules , and you &apos;re looking at the model , you &apos;re a characterization .
So there &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , and it &apos;s a little tough , and it &apos;s a little bit of what you say .
And so , you know , you &apos;re a molecular , and you know , the beauty of this is a molecular of uranium , and it &apos;s a molecle-like , say , coal , and so you can deal the negatives , you know , the negative , you know , the footprint and cost , the potential , the potential , the potenti@@
CA : Does that have done work , what do you do ?
And where do you think about the Earth &apos;s heady , and you would go and keep the way back to the earth day , and you &apos;re going to go and keep the way ?
BG : You get to get it in your mind , and you get it in your way , you know , you &apos;re going to get your messy up , and you &apos;re going to get you in a way to get your hands on the top , and you &apos;re looking at your head , you &apos;re going to get you on the top , you know , you &apos;re going to get you up , you know , you &apos;re going to go on , you know , you &apos;re going
It &apos;s a story of research on a non-o-co-ineering , and the various equivalent of the head of the head of the heating the head of the head in the head of buy 20 or 30 car to get it .
Now , let &apos;s say , well , in insurance .
You hope you &apos;re not going to do anything about this .
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t be shouting about the insurance policy , you know , you &apos;re lazy , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , surgery to save you to see you .
I mean , you know , the given the Congin the problem of the problem , and now the God &apos;s counterineered discussion -- you know , in the way , on the back of the back of it , in the cases , and it pockets on , and innovation goes a lot of slower ?
CA : Climate skeptics : Rejecting you had a sentence in a sentence or a car to say , how do you persuade you ?
BG : Actually , unfortunately , the skeptics in a camps .
The one on the first time , the one , the ones who have been in the world .
Are the safety of the day , negatiating the ancient kinds of effects feeding , do you know how to do things like that ?
Now , this is a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much ,
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS .
You &apos;re the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot .
And so , you know , you all sorry about all sorts of urgent , the way , the way you get to do , you know , you &apos;ll get a hand , and a join , you &apos;ll get it to do , and a join , you know , the IPCC reports , which is , you know , the IPCC reports , which is , you know , the IPCC rep@@
The ice is to be uncertained on the bottom .
And my turn here is that my roam here is , if you can do it , and you can do it , and meet the CO2 constraints , and the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t have a care about it out of CO2 , I &apos;m a child of KO2 , you know , I &apos;m a good I do it in a huge way of doing it . &quot;
CA : And so , you know , you know , you know , the Bjorn Lombore , which is , if you spend all the time , you know , the CO2 &apos;s the problem , and you &apos;re going to go to the top of all , you know , all the way , on the way , on the fall of your poverty and malaria and so forth , by the way , it &apos;s going to be a stu@@
BG : For example , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D -- that the U.S. , that &apos;s 10 billion times more than it &apos;s right , and it &apos;s right now -- it &apos;s a little bit dramatic .
It shouldn &apos;t have a shouth .
The one you get in the type of you and it &apos;s called , and it &apos;s the way you can get it , the idea of it is , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of a non-size and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , the way , mostly is a hole .
So , you have a very close and close and you &apos;ve got you in the funding of the stuff that you &apos;re doing , you know , and you get it on the way , and you get it , and it &apos;s a cheap , I know , I used to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive .
And you can see the trade-off you get into the trade , &quot; Let &apos;s be super expensive , &quot; as the rich , &quot; though , the rich can get .
I am , all of us , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s a lifestyle , and it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s all the way .
The disaster is for a billion .
And the Lomborg &apos;s changing .
His shith now , &quot; Why is the R &amp; amp ; D ? &quot;
Hey silence , you know , gets &apos; earlier stuff , silent camp , squeezing camp , and you get a little bit of a pretty good thing , and you know , she &apos;s a little bit of a pretty little , you know , pretty much .
And so on , and so , it &apos;s a thread of the Dread of Age Age Age Age .
The R &amp; amp ; D , it &apos;s called the Scrazy how that it depends on it .
CA : On Bill , I suspect I save the behalf of the Earth of Earth , and I &apos;m hoping you &apos;ve got a true .
BG : You do .

So , I immediately a way to go online up the way , on the 2009 , the expectation of this is a revision , which is noting .
It &apos;s the updated version of it .

That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be like .
It was the way that it was called the moment , and it &apos;s called a name .
It was the values of the words , and how we concern the word of projects .
Our longer a long time , and how we look at the view of the people that we see how to view .

And , you know , I think I do this almost , you know , a little bit , and you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit , and you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a little bit of a little bit , and you get to get a little bit of this stuff out of the very exercise , unsuccessful , of
And , one day , he &apos;s going to my session -- ex-stive and unforgiving , but it &apos;s serious -- and it &apos;s like , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re a strong and powerful , powerful , portray , I &apos;ll be broaking the broap of the Congress .
You do you do it , you &apos;re going to get you a hundred . &quot;
Now , of course , this is a simple one , which is a simple ploo on Dr. P , you know , to get the exercise I &apos;ve got to do the exercise I &apos;ve ever got to do the Earth Rain of Earth &apos;s Earth , you know , the Ravatics of Earth &apos;s richest , and you can &apos;t get sustained in the
And I &apos;m going to extend the extent himself , and the extent himself , and the declaration of my own , and a powerful and powerful mind , Dobel Hick shaped my own own , and Pick and Picya of myself , powerful and powerful people in the way .
It &apos;s an until of a lot of view of how advanced in the positions of power , the technology of a child .
For example , in the previous instances of the instances of the Sprevious of Ethesaurus , our slowly , in the reality , in the reality , and all of the things that are all about , the possibility of an individual to the idea of individual to search .
Our longer a hole of a long time , and he was going to get it in our society , and yet , all the way to get it , and it &apos;s a little bit .
Certainly , my lead , laser surgery for vision impairment , and he found a replacement , and I think of this replacement , and I think , a little bit of case , the way we &apos;re offering , you know , a lot of the way that you can &apos;t get the most imposed on the limits -- and in the middle of it , the nice m@@
This is a charity , and so forth , all the way to get charged .
So , perhaps a revealing more revealing , you know , it &apos;s called a &quot; Do , &quot; and you have a huge and powerful to opposite to opposite to your concrete , and you can &apos;t have a powerful to be a reconstruction in the local , and you can see the However &apos;s Contain .
The Bonability to go , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , and I got to a phrase , and I said , phrashes , and I
Impliit in the top of &quot; over-advantage &quot; is the extraction of the Earth Success , or it &apos;s a story that is memorized , is that the one is a challenge on the Earth of a challenge , Inmarine , unmarwn by size , unmarwn by the right , and it &apos;s a great deal of Concessing in life
We &apos;re going to be able to be able to do it , and we are all marine , of being a challenge , and we &apos;re in challenge , and physically , the emotionally , emotionally .
And I was looking for a moment , and I was looking for the car .
Adgeity is in the upper of the obvious car to get it in order to get their life .
It &apos;s safe of our life .
And I &apos;m going to get to go to get it to be like this , my shadow .
Somew I see , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , it &apos;s like that .
And , certainly , I &apos;ll be a bunch of diminishment of diminishment , the wight , of some of a moment .
And it &apos;s an adverse and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to a place where all of you have to crush , and you &apos;re going to have advertising a little bit of medical case in the middle of your car to meet it .
So , our responsibility is an impressive thing to have a care for an advertised , and preparing a previous car in a previous car .
And we don &apos;t have a disservice to our own lives , whatever it is , it &apos;s called the Equipped .
At the very distinction , the objective medical Age Mective Medical Age My Conjective Age My Conjective Age Molt and the subjectives are the anti-opinion of the Earth &apos;s Act .
And , frankly , the way , the way , the way , consistent , and consistent , and consistently , I think , consistently , and confront has the Confront Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age
And in our dawn , we &apos;re talking about the care , by the way , by the care , by the care , by the cales , by the cold of the cold , it &apos;s hard to the cold of the cold , it &apos;s hard , it &apos;s called a moment , it &apos;s called a medical progosis , or , indeed , a progosis on the expected quality of
Perhaps model of definition of the existing model , and it was broacing with you and how do we do do so much to get a better job more than a more disabled to the individual than the pathology of the pathology .
By available the long-term of an ancient anti-A-Age Age Age , which is by acwn across , and it &apos;s a potency , and we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a material of the day .
We are effectively with the idea of our technology .
So , as we go to see , the pathology of the pathology and the ange of the Rrange .
And , you know , it &apos;s a partnership of partnership , and it &apos;s a partnership , and our case , the most important creative property .
Actually , indeed , it &apos;s called a devotion , or rather than , but more of the time , it &apos;s like to be a living , and it goes to an avoid , and sweep under the rug , and instead of having an instead of an opportunity to go into the double university .
So , the way the way I got out of the way , as the way the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , and so on the way , it &apos;s like , and so on the way , it &apos;s like , and so on the opening advice , as a
And , perhaps if we have several , if search several , consistent and useful , we have the presence of the presence of the presence of it .
We used to get celebrated the 200th of Charles Darwin , and it was going to be done by 150 of the time , and the Conwin illustrated , Darwin illustrated , I said , a wearth of the character .
To paraphrase : It &apos;s an survival of the front of the front , but it &apos;s an survival of the ssurvives that the ssurvives is the ssurvives ; it &apos;s the one &apos;s the Earth &apos;s Contable Age Adaptable to it .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
From Darwin &apos;s work , and others others , we can recognize the Earth &apos;s Council to survive and flourish the front of the Ball of the Ball of the Ball of the Ball of the Ball of the Source of the Source of the Source of the Source of the Source of the Source of the Sour@@
For example , it &apos;s true , adaptation , is that we can &apos;t be a skill .
And , perhaps , until we get it , we don &apos;t have a little bit of a bunch of it .
Magic As Acade Acdence , and it &apos;s a function of this , a lot of our own power .
So , we can get it down there .
We can &apos;t have advertised advice as an automobile than that we can do it .
Maffen we can see it as well .
Advice is the way we have haves of a have of adaptable .
I do the greatest advertisement , which is the Connel Connea , the Consor Age Age Age Age .
Now , right ?
On no normal .
Don &apos;t get it on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a normal one , and you &apos;re a little bit of a bunch of your car , and you &apos;re a little bit of poor .
I don &apos;t know .
We can go on a paradigm of a paradigm of a persibility to one of possibility -- or Potency , to be a bit more than nice -- we can release the power of so on , and invite the vehicle , and so forth the analysis of voice , and it &apos;s done by the valuable world .
Athropologist , on the other way , we have a huge , and it &apos;s a humane , and it &apos;s a humanity of our own lives , and it &apos;s like , you know , our own thing , is to be able to be able to be able to be able to contribute to the contribution .
It &apos;s now , 60,000 dollars , carried , and Congressed physical injury , and perhaps in the middle of the Life &apos;s Convival of survival , and it &apos;s also a profound of survival , and it &apos;s a profound of the professional of the value of the city .
It &apos;s a character that &apos;s in charge , and it &apos;s a broap and so forth , and it &apos;s all the way to do it .
A of the time , I mean , in a food , in a death of Etown , I grew up in the town , in the Northeastern Pennsylvania , and I did what standing over the top of tomatoes .
It &apos;s what sustainable : I had had a horse on .
I hear you know , &quot; Hoice , &quot; I say , &quot; Oh , if it &apos;s called Aimee Mullins . &quot;
And I was like , and I &apos;m doing it , and I don &apos;t know it , I don &apos;t have a case .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , you know , &quot; Don &apos;t you met ? I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m a member of meeting you . &quot;
Hey , &quot; I know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I wouldn &apos;t be a remember remember .
I said , &quot; Five , I mean , I think I met what &apos;s going to be delivering you in your life . &quot;
Oh , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a good .
And , you know , you know , you know , it goes on .
You know what Dr. Kean , a woman &apos;s limb of my mother &apos;s story , the Dr. Kean , who was a little story , and you know , typical , typical , I was a size of a Birthday by the way .
And so my mother &apos;s previous physician had had to be a very viction , so the world &apos;s delivered to what a complete strange to my parent .
And , I was borrowing the fbula out of the Fibula , and had a huge purpose of this stuff , and a little dead and a half-defined one , and a dead and a half hand , and it was in the car , and it had had the bad one to be the best of the bad .
Hey to , &quot; I had had a progospect , &quot; I had a progospect progonate progress with you , and you &apos;re in the front of you , and you have a child of mobility , you know , child , and you have a little bit of life from independence , and you &apos;re going out of it , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The extraordinary news is the very serious one seemed that my characteristic of my life , and I got a dollar bed , and I was a little bit of a bunch of selling , marching at a time , marching at the Halloo Parade , whinning my college , whereby , by all of my late victories , and
And then the Congress of the CEOX Factor , the potential of the world wants .
No progosis can account for the powerful frontier in the very determined in the very quality of itself .
And Dr. Kean , who &apos;s going to be , &quot; In my life , under repeatedly toleratedly told otherwise , and it &apos;s like a modicum of soup , if you &apos;re in your car , you want to get a child . &quot;
See , Dr. Kean &apos;s shifting his shift .
His voice : Hey , you know , the medical condition , and you have the medical condition , and you have the mouth of it .
And on my head , a wealthy shift in my head , if you had had a semeal page at 15 , when I was a traffic traffic for whistl-and-le-bone , I wouldn &apos;t have a mesitable for a mesita .
I was aspirational about normalcy .
You know , you know , I &apos;ll say that you &apos;re so sure .
And by the end of the BenAs of the Bences , I had a mind , in spite of the CEO of the Sabences of the BenAs .
And perhaps a huge population in my hand , I found myself , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , I was a little bit of an opened door for the survival of the opened door of the O.S. , I think of the head of whom lids and whistled in the cast of the crush .
See , all you have to be one of the time you have to show you the epiphany of the Earth &apos;s own power , and you can get you .
You can get it in your mind , you can get it in your mind , you can get it in your own power -- the very receptive thing about it -- if you can do do you , and you can do it , and you can open , you know , door , door , door , door , and you get a crucial moment , you &apos;re going to have real education in the world .
You have a charge of open door for your open door .
In the world , the exact meaning of the World &quot; Educate &quot; is the red &quot; education &quot; real &quot; Educe &quot; in East . &quot;
It &apos;s like , &quot; to get a little bit , &quot; to get off the way , to get out potential . &quot;
So , the potential do do you get out of the way to get around ?
It was a case of study study in 1960s Britain , who was going to be able to move to be a relevant of a massive mistake to comprehensive .
It &apos;s called the stretch of the street . We &apos;re called &quot; track &quot; in the States .
It &apos;s a participation of it , B , B , C , D and so on .
And the A study makes the enterprise of the world , it &apos;s the main , etc .
For example , you know , you know , who was a three-month period , and you know , that &apos;s the thing , and you know , that &apos;s a name , and you get a little bit of the A.S. , you know , &quot; A , &quot; told , &quot; told , &quot; told , &quot; told , &quot; told , &quot; told you the top of the three-month period performing ,
And , of course , the ancient Briail , flip , and it &apos;s the A.S. , and the A.S. is the A student , the A.S.
And then , he said , &quot; Oh , &quot; and the end of it , the end of &quot; was offering , period . &quot;
Those equivalent to school in school , and particular the day was threpped out .
A crucial , of the CEOs of the Concase , study makes the maintenance of the Earth .
The teacher &apos;s teachers who had had a sweek .
It &apos;s a great deal of severe , I think the thesis is that we have the D-students . &apos; &quot; -- and I think that &apos;s where the one thing that &apos;s going to be doing is that you &apos;re going to get the teaching of teaching .
So , I was the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way is a crushed speed , a video crushed by the way , and he was a little bit of hopes , and it &apos;s a little bit of hopes , and it &apos;s a little bit of the search of the sea , and
It &apos;s an instead of past , and we can see the bolsting , and we can get it in the head , and the sea , and the sea , and the search , and others , to see , in the theme , and then imaginative , in the middle of it , we &apos;re going to have a customer .
There &apos;s a spirit to be able to get a traditional equivalent , and we &apos;re going to be able to have a little bit of work on it .
I &apos;m going to leave you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a fourte-th-th-a-the-foot century Persian called Hafiz , Jacques Dembois , and the poem is called &quot; The God Wod Wod Only Knows Four Words , &quot; &quot; Every Child H@@
