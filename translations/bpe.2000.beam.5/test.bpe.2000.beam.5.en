Several officer, at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow.
And the very pretty simple pretty simple: teams of the Middle At Middle Act the test standing up the talling of the test of 20 saghetti, and one yard of tape, on-yard of Sting and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow hand is to be.
And, in fact, it's a very simple thing, and it's hard to pretty much depending on the collaborator in the pretty quickly.
And so I think about what was going on, and I incorporated it into a design shop.
And so what a huge is looking for.
And then, you know, I'm spending 70 designs in 70 design, and designed and designed and architects, the CTOs of the Fortune's 50, and there's an extract exercise that reveals the exercise of the very deep of the collaboration of collaboration, and I'm going to share.
So, normally, it's taken by orienting themselves in the world.
On the way, characteristics out of it, you know, it's like, you know, jucky.
It's the way that you're planning to planning, organizing, you know, the sketch of the spaghetti.
The majority of the Conjority of Comembling the sticks into ever-grand things.
And then finally, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's all the way out of the marshmallow, and it turns out to be like, and it turns out, and it was like, and it stood up, and it was a day, and it was a day.
On the heart of the day, it's called the "table-hy-and-and-day" cycle, "" Your the white of the marshmallow car "collapse."
So, as you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, a lot of stuff like this, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a lot of times, "uh-oh," and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates.
OK, so, you know, you know, cheat, the map of districted and so forth.
And of course, by the time, they're going to be done by the time, and it's a lot of times, and there's a day, and it's like, "ta-da" worth, and they're going to recently recently recent graduate.
And it was amazing.
At Peter tells us, perhaps, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's the most important thing to do that, you know, it's the kind of thing that's going to be like, you know, the whole thing's a thing about all the way.
So the way that you're talking about? Why? What is it?
And Peter liffs to say, you know, none of the Men of the PEOs, you know, CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
It's not a good jump in the spend of jucky power.
Between the way, you know, it's a very well.
And the reason is a bunch of business, trained to the sound right now, right?
And the execute on it.
And, by the time, is that the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top, call out of the mouth of it.
It was a crisis.
Right? Right.
What major do differentiates is the marshmallow, and a shared prototype prototype, successive prototype, checing the marshmallow, white multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way.
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project.
And then, rather version, they get strong feedback, and you know, it's like that.
So the Lacity to play with this prototype is essential, and let's take a look at what's going on.
So the average for them is, you know, the average is, you know, in the average, by 20 inches -- business of business, half of them; lawyer, a purpose, you know, you know, a down-advantage of times, kinderer, thickled, evidence.
Who does this matter?
Architect and engineer, thanky.
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world.
And so on, you know, it's going to be the potential and self-cleanly geetetrical powered geetrical patterns in the world.
So CEOs, a piece of an announcement, a little bit of the CEOs, and there was an average.
You put you on executive adminances on the team, the significantly.
It's called you, it's called you, you're going to go, you go, you go, you go, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Win the way."
You can be conscious. You can get it.
It's called the killing of the skills of facilitation.
And there's a project that project the project.
And whatever, you know, team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team.
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong.
For example, you're having a type of typical performance, you're going to be able to get some of the time, you know, you get the same thing that you're doing, you know, it's the way that you have, you know, it's the way that you have.
And I tried.
I do, let's go once.
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning.
So, how do you know, how do you get to be done with that, and design is design?
What about the results?
At the way, he said, "No two team had a standing in a standing.
Now, anyone had to say, "You say," Yeah one in your mind, "Do you have the price."
Like, isn't it? However stacking, staces, staces, stacks impact.
We arrived at the exercise on the exercise.
What do you do?
So now, now, the value of prototyping.
So this is the bottom of the very, very much, the very way to do the same thing about the stuff.
At the tallest, the tallest in the least, the test of the brain.
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives and search.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a marshmallow, you know, you're a marshmallow?
And the reason is, I'm doing a process of processing tools and processing processing the cars of taking video, and it's a visual effects.
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day.
Frankly, frankly, it project has marshmallow, right?
The challenge provides provides a shared, and a slide of a long time, a sustainable, a little bit of a pole on the right.
And so, you know, the value of the City of the City of the City of the exercise.
And it's like you're going to be able to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It's a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of your marshmallows.
Final by-step-by-step steps.
This is the kind of crazy thing that's going on, and it's a little bit of fuzy, and it's like that's going to be the movement of what's going on.
You know, there's an autonomous type of people who are there.
And the fundamental lesson, I think, is a design, design is a contact.
It demanded the way we bring it all from our sensory to the world, and then we got the very series of our own, and we got the very little bit of our own, our fellow and our case to the challenge.
And, you know, there's a prototype of the prototype of that, and it's all the way to turn it into a type of type of type of type of type, and it's like, "uh-oh," right now.
And that's a little bit differently.
All right.
Let's get a little predent right now.
A more machine, a cool, TEDish machine, and it machine, it machine.
And then you get it in the way to get it into it.
And you can go, you can go forward, you can go forward, you can't have you yourself.
And I wonder, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was boreful, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, you know, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and you know, all the way to go to
I don't do it. Do go to go to go to go back to the Cont-ConTurious or Twitter "American Idol."
I don't know.
I was Convinced, of course, of pull to nostalgia, to knowing you.
And I do.
I mean, I said, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say."
I don't have to go to go back, and it's called an adventurous way.
It's offering the possibilities of being planet, which is going to be done, you know, it's going to be done, you know, Congo, Congo.
As I do to get it in the machine, and I goodbed to go to go.
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the case, and it's based on a planet, and it's based on it, and it's basically choose to choose, which is, by the way, mobility, autonomous, declining rates of disease...
It was a matter of mind.
My great-graded participation, all of the things, by the mate of 60.
My grandparents pushed 70.
My participation, my participated in 80.
This is how it was a nine at the beginning of my death.
With you, it's in the middle of it, and it's a bigger deal.
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi, excited to live to live in the world, in fact, the world in the world is 100.
Think, you know, it's going to be done for that.
And does it happen?
Smallpox. Smallpox killed a billion-billion-plan.
It reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way, and it was not a mistake.
It's called it. It's a Dvanished.
We vanquish it. Puff.
In the same time, it was huge, threatless millions of us, which is a longer exist, hardly.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio...
What do you do anyone's doing it?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to be fed billions of stuff, which is the Center of the Centch method.
And to my mind, the Centh method -- stuff out out, searched if it works, it changed off with the one of the Saccomplishh of humanity.
That's the way we look at it.
Unfortunately, in fact, all the way news the way, it's all the way to do this, and it requires it.
And one of the time is that all our accomplishments all our accomplishments, a trillion of goes to get to get hongry in your head.
You know, it's called the rising, and it's a very rapidly sharing, and it's very rapidly, and it's a little bit of discovery.
And then, you know, that's where our imagination to the thoroughly thoroughly drash.
Potal water, Arablands, rainforests, oil, gas, it's the way that it's done, and it's all right, and innovate, and innovate and innovate, innovate in the way out, we have a moment.
So the thing is, Can we do? And I can do it.
I mean it was clear to be able to do it, it's going to be able to get a little bit of food, it wants to be a little bit of billions of domain, and it goes into the country, and it's listening to the country.
I like to do that, the destroy of power, destroy.
I do it, and I don't know it's going to be in the way in the way.
There are no matter of the Earth's heads of the Earth keeps coming up with the story -- one of the Earth keeps going up with night: We're going to be progress in Conence more than that right now.
And so, you know, it's going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can.
We have the verge of amazing, and yet I've gone to go to go to go to go back to go, 300 people, the Enlightenment, to the British Age Age Age Age Age, and he was going to be a little bit of the progress, and he was going to be farmed with front of the anti-vigorsly, on
Peating wrap is very popular, and so you know, the thing that you can do is, you know, the uglish you can.
On the audience wants to go.
And, listening, consisted with an opposition to virtual opinion; the Contled population of being progressed.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
You chose entirely your own. Sorry, you know.
And hang out to characteristics.
There's a story, I wrote a story, Vaccine for The New Yorker.
And I think it's a popular opposition: opposition to the conception of it, it's all of the heavens of effective public public public public.
I do to do it, I do, like, I wrote, I wrote, I wrote a story, and I was a mobile.
And so, I wrote a story story, I wrote a story called the genetically engineered food.
Same one, more bigger.
Pew's crazy.
So I wrote a story about this story, and I couldn't do it, and I was curious about what's "Frankenfoods," which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark, rather than a haphazard way, which puzzling itself, which puzzling on.
You know, you're doing it, I do, I do the story, I wrote the story, I was mobion.
I am a journalist.
We type, we're falling, we're going to dinner. It was in.
And thanthfully, thanthfully, I was born on, and I couldn't do some people out there, and eventually I do.
And in the middle of God, Congy mazes are going to happen to be fantatically going to be fantatically.
Same amazing thoughful, educated equipment.
It's also the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same.
And it's going to be a little bit of it.
As I do, you know, you're honest.
We ended up in the middle of the day, in the middle of Earth, Congress Congress, to progress.
We do it ambivalding.
We're doing it in ironic terms, "Congress."
Okay, I think that's what's going on for that, and I was going to be able to think about it.
We're going to read faith in an institutional, in authority, and it's in love, and it's a little bit of a reason we shouldn't go.
You can say, "You can say," Yeah, "and he wants to go.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass deeply, hanging.
You can, you can be able to get your choose.
It's a little bit of this stuff that's going to happen, and it's a little bit of a problem that's going to be a little bit of a bit of trouble in the front.
Ask, which is, demand, demand is evidence.
Don't do anything.
So here, you get a little bit of this: you're going to get a little bit, you know, you're going to get your acceptance on account the way, and we're having a little bit about it.
And the reason I can say, the idea is that, in an epidemic of the epidemic of being, you know, there's an image of the OK in the epidemic of the SII.
About 12, which is a story that was published, a horrible story, a horrible story, the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Ton of the study of stuff to see, what's true.
For example, tons of study like this, it's serious issues.
The job.
The bottom of the United States is called the United States, in England, Sweden, Ganada, and it's all the thing: no correlation, no one, none at all.
It's called it. It's a matter of matter, and it's a matter of character, we know, we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen, and you can do it.
We don't have a bunch of documents, and we have a government officially, and I do, I said I was doing all do.
You know?
The results of His is an amazing thing.
Disastrous: The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs of the Earth's vaccine rate for measles.
It's discovery, and it's an ashamed of it.
It was horrible.
What about a child of a child?
Now now, I do. I do it.
Do you see, you know, there's some kind of maps of maps?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles?
And there are very much.
Again, in fact, you know, you know, that's where it's like, you know, it's going to be like 160,000 in the water.
A lot of death of measles -- 20.
On the heart of it, it's going to be done, and we can put it out of our minds, and you know, Jenny McCarthy can be preachingly preaching me, and Eilliteracy, "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."
And the thing you can do is, you know, it's going to be able to get out of this, and it's going to be in the left.
It's not very much, though, is that it's the bottom of the bottom, but it's really the same thing.
And it goes back to that.
It's a little while, Jonas Salk.
Heap of the situation of some of the crucial of some of them.
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.
It's a bad guy in the middle, which is how much.
His name is Paul Offit.
Hey hey, a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff.
It's called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning.
Pretty, right?
At the time, Paul's goes to go, and you know, it's a very vaccine, and it's like vaccine, and it's like vaccine, and it's like vaccine, and it's like, you know, it's going to be like this.
And then it goes on.
So, Paul's Ana terrorist.
And Paul Department, Conna, OK, OK, he's going to go to the Council of Earth.
However, he asked him to go, and he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, and he remembered him, and he remembered him, and he remembered him to school.
And hold, Do Paul was vaccine.
I don't know, I don't say, say, vaccines are essential.
You see, you know, you have a disease, you know, horrible discussion.
We human measles in the world.
And it turns out that, and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtually of this, and it's going to be done by that, and it's going to be taking place on it.
And you know, that's what the of measles are.
What does polio? Let's go on. Why?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks, and it's like, I know, I do something.
There's no one.
She switched into the vaccine, you know, a polio, no way.
Fine.
Why? Let's go on polio.
We're going to have polio in the hyesterday.
Today, I don't know, you know, this guy, you know, the guy in Lagos in Lagos in Lagos, and he's going to go to LAX, right now, right now.
And then go to a bunch of couple of hours in a couple of hours, there's a car running a car, and then go to Long Beach, and it's going to be a very fabulous TED dinner.
And then, you know, it's going to be a paralytic disease, and we're going to be a paralytic disease, and we don't have anything else in the bottom of the bottom of it.
And the planet is on the planet, and it pretty much predent.
Now, let's move forward, and we do it to do it.
You know, Everyone's vitamins in the morning?
Echinacea, a type of antioxidant to get you.
I have to do it in American.
Now, the stuff of the stuff, and there's a lot of alternative medicines, and as a result of it, as a result of them, how many times we look at the top of it.
This is all the material.
By the way, you know, it's going to be an altitude thing.
It's like, you know, you're a little billion dollars in pay 28 billion dollars in it?
I'm doing you.
That's where it comes. Dark.
Why do we do? Why do we do?
For example, I was there, I was having a big charma.
We have characteristics. We don't know.
And we shouldn't go and look at the care of the stuff.
It's called a brude of millions.
It was a cold of the astonishingly cold and soul-grade to the ancient movement.
So that's where it's like, and so forth do?
We run into the arm of Big Placebo.
It's a fantastic. I do Big Placebo.
You know, you're going to be able to do it, you know, it's a serious one, and it's a nice thing, and we're billions of dollars on dollars on it.
And I heard all sorts of things like this.
No of it -- gindgo, fraud; echinacea, fraud; I don't have to do it, and it's all the way to do that there's a billions of dollars on dollars on the dollars on it -- it's fraud.
And you're talking? At you? At you, I say, you know, I'm going to ask you, and I say, "What do you do? Let's do things like this.
It doesn't do it. "
You know? You're wrong.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if it was the size of the outside of HHS, "Hmm, I found myself in the Science of Lake the Side Oevidence of my experts on my experts," or simply scanner quack to enter the patient's coffee.
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
From up up to Thabo Mberki South Africa.
Hey killed 400,000 of His in Insisting, Garlic and lemon and limon the antiretroviral press the antiretroviral prospect of AIDS.
Hundreds of the Earthern Dutath-death, in a hand, has been plagued to be a plagued than anything in the world.
Please, don't have no consequences.
It's pretty much.
Now, the model of mindly epidemic, in the middle of right now, is the absurd of the proponent of genetically engineered food, and the organic elite.
It's the idiotic debate. It was a huge thing.
It's a debate, and it's called metaphor.
It's an ideology, it's going to be done.
Every single crash, you know, the CEOs of rice, the split of Parsley, the Brusss sprout a lot of you.
You think, you know, you're going to be the same thing in the garden of Eden.
I wasn't, you know, it's going to be done, you know, Christmas is going to happen. We do it all.
We do it at the lower 11,000.
And it goes and forth about it.
We're talking about the stuff.
Now, now we can do it in a more precise way -- and it's in the precise precise, absolutely -- but we can put it in a local vitamin A into rice, and the stuff can be done by millions of times, millions of times, projecting.
You don't do anything to do?
I said, I don't know it.
We object to genetically genetically engineered.
Why do we do?
For example, the As Constantly constantly -- Too's chemicals, pestr, hormones, monoculture, we don't know, there's a lot of game of the game of the stuff that's going on.
We don't know companies patent life.
We don't have the companies of owning.
And you have my response to all of it?
Yes, you're right. Let's get free with it.
It's true, it's a huge food problem.
Actually, you know, a little bit of judgment.
It's a bunch of patent on it.
You're going to be a company.
It was indeed.
It's in the middle of it; it's a project.
It's a profit, and it's a project like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, but the way the background is that the thing that we're doing, and whereas the thing we're doing is that the thing we call the Araid Anifid, is the very deader, and it's preventring millions of dollars on the
You think, in the way 50, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be -- you know, it's going to be -- you know, there's about it right now, 70.
investment in Africa over the load 30.
Disgrubful. Disgrust.
On the time, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be there.
And that's Genetically Engineered.
We don't have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with, you know, stupid stuff, which is called the Cassava.
Cassava was a bunch of hand.
It's a child of a potato.
It's a bunch of calories. It sucks.
It's called a protein called it, and it's protein, and it's a little bit of engineering in industry that's going on in it right now.
And then, you know, it's going to be able to be able to be able to get there with a bunch of work.
You know, wouldn't, you know, how do you get there?
It's like, you know, it's wouting with Chez Panisse.
And all I can say, is that the thing is: Why are we going to shape it?
I do, let's go back to this: Why are we going on with shape?
Are we going to move the way to move?
It's literally, it's because it's a chemicle.
It's intensive to be ridiculous for hormones for hormones, our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment, equivalent, smart food.
You know, it's called the Rice Krispie, which is the kicky, and it's in the head of the Earth, and it's in the middle of it, and it's in the middle of it.
You know, you know?
And we don't know, if you're going continuous to the issue the way the way we go, and we're going to be a little bit of a good job of it, and we're going to be a good thing about it, and we're going to be a good thing about this: high-tech colonialism.
There are no way to get to the Council of that.
It's kind of selfish, it's kind of like that, and it's kind of like that, and it's going to stop stop.
So, as a result of Lamazingly conversation, you can say, you know, you say, "Like, you squeek it in an amazing machinery, you know, go?"
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It stuck in the present right now, but we have a lot of amazing.
We can make a bunch machine on anyway.
We can move it on the line, and we can move it, and we'd like to move the way to move the way, on the middle of the day.
We do it conversations, and we're going to get car, you know, you know, you know, and you can get it in the machine, and we're going, and we're going, and we're going to go, and we're going to get here.
I was going to do it, and as an amazing thing about being concerts, and it's right now.
You.
One day, Los Angeles Times Fehinist Steve Lopez, With Along the Earth Eong Bopez, who's going to be a downtown of downtown Los Angeles.
And the source of what you do, you know, African-American you, charming, bomeless, playing violin.
And I got a story about you, called the Steve, and Steve, Steve, Steve, a story called the basis of a movie, and what turns out to be a movie in a movie, and the Robert Downey a Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, the Juilliard-@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard, he's going to go to a complete crash, and 30, later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve, and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond, you know, you know, you know, you know, what music heroes shape, bond, and ultimately instrumentally, you know -- if you're a pardon, you'll get the base, you get the outside.
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, Disney Concert at Concert.
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth, symphony, and it's going to be a little backing.
Hey, what happened to be a very young jovial and gregarious mobility, and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the Dodgers to go to the World Series, all of the rising of the rise to the Council of Earth's ancient passage work in the lower movement of Beethoven
And we had music music, and I was in email to Steve, and I said, you know, OK, and I got yourself at night, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, OK, and he saw a violin.
Now, I'm going to refer to Nathaniel refuses, you know, that's where I showed therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and I scar a styed for him for his entire life.
There's a result of it, and it's a little bit of a schizophrenic episode, the World of Earth's manifest themselves him, and though, disappearing for days, wandering the street of Skid Row, exposed to its head of horror, and the toral of Horror of Horror, and
And Nathaniel, which is a state of agitation, and he's going to go to the Walt Disney Concert, and it was a child of manic glorious glint in Hall of Hall of the eyes.
And then I'm going to smoke invisible demand, and how the poisoning him in his sleep.
And I do what Araid, you know, you know what's Araid, you know, you know what's going to be in the middle of you, and you know, I'm going to be a little bit of work in the state of his state, and the Latin of Raints of His, and the ConAs of His, and the Folin Departgies in the midd@@
Like, I was playing.
And I played the Concobian's Comethoven Violin Concerto.
And as I played, I was determined by what a project is a profound of an ocean in Nathaniel.
It's what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceuital, which is a chemical reaction, a chemical reaction, for my plays music music, of catalyst.
And Nathaniel, manic a little bit of what transformed into a lot, a quick curiosity and grade.
And in a miracle, lifeline, at a middle of violin, by ear, certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of abundance -- birth, Tchaikovsky, Siberius.
And we have music music, Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B, the Bartók, all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the middle of encyclopedic, biggest music of music, but related to the neighborhoods of related to a music.
Hey, you spoke to the characteristics of the characteristics of happening and a lot of hand, I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And playing music, and you had to have music, and you had a transportation of the paranoid, you disturbed the Earth CEO of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, and ended, brilliant, Juilliard-trained.
Music is medicine. Music changes.
And for Nathaniel, music is it.
This is a music allows, and it has to be a hand, and it has a huge and delush, and she shape a realm of creativity, in reality.
And it's an essential hit state.
And I was determining what the very sence of species.
So, what the very reason is like to be in the moment, in the middle of it, in the first place in the very fundamental core, our emotion, and all of our major creativity, lies the creativity, we can't have a shape in reality.
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves, inspiring and unita.
And for Nathaniel, he needed music breathing him back into a fold of term.
The redeme power of music bought him back to a family of family behind him, and a narrow, and she was offered him.
And I want to get a music, M.D., which is the Wold Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, which is a name of it, and it's a name of it.
You.
Bruno Giussani: On you. Thanks.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I was like to play with you, I was hugely celebrating.
So, please shape.
I Jane McGonigal. I did a game designer.
I've gone online now online for 10, and my goal for the size is to cash the way to get it to get it to be able to see the thing in real life in real life, in real life, in real life, and the way to see the thing in real life.
Now, I've got a plan for it, and the Convincing more, including all of you, to spend more, bigger and trapped.
Right now we spend a little bit of a billion-playing game.
Some of you would be like, "Keep a lot of perspective to play a little bit.
Magic, consider considering, considering that problems in the real way.
For example, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, the opposite is true.
Three hours of hours a week is not a little bit nearly a little bit more than the way that the world is intended.
In the middle of the day, I was born if the survival of survival the Century of Earth has been on the planet, the way I was doing is dramatically dramatically.
I entered Calalculated the totally, 21 trillion hours of game.
So, at the end of a cool intuitive, I say, "Let's say," On the way, it's going to be funny, poverty, poverty, functions, whatever conflict, "indeed," I'll say, "Let's go to the aspire -- you know," -- you know, at the end of the time, you know,
No. I mean, I'm serious. I do.
Right.
I think of the victy pretty much pretty photography, and I said, "Only, you know," the Convival of the Convival of the Convival of the Council. Truly.
It's a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano.
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming, this is a camera camera in the front of gamers.
And it's a classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you don't have a gamer, you know, you're a little bit of the stuff that you're going to be in the photo.
You see, you see the Age of urgency, you know, it's a little bit of intense concentration, the deep, focus on a taccling and a level of the problem.
You see you're going to be a gamer, you want to be a nuances: the Crinkle of the eyes, and the Mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrow up is surprise.
It's a good-off of "epic."
Oh, you're a little bit of it.
OK, well, you know, that's the way that it goes.
In the epic, in epic, is so extraordinarily positive, you had nothing to do with the possibility of possibility to you.
It's an aldyond the threshold of imagination, and you get it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a little bit of discover, you know, you're a little bit of an uncovered.
This is the epic.
It's a gamer on the verge of epic.
And on the face of that, on the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the slide of the Bristacle of the East century -- the understanding of the Earth century -- the understanding of the face of the Age Council, all the odd, is on the verge of epic.
Now, unfortunately, unfortunately, is the face of the face of the face, which seems to be in this day life, in the end life, in the face of now, in the end life, in the face of a day living in the face.
An the At At At Life At Life.
Don't have it. Can you see the sea? Yes. Good.
It's the "I Not Good At Life."
It's a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, and I think of my ph.D., it's in the middle of it in real life.
And it's a problem, and it's a problem of it.
We're going to be able to do it in the reality of reality, and we're going to be in this.
I don't know what's going on in search, although, although, although.
We do it in game.
So, I was able to do it in motivated to do -- inspred and cooperate.
And on the way, you know, I think it's a matter of all the way that I think of the Moly-version of itself -- the English environment -- the slikely to get to -- you know, a moment of moment, the English, and the Enlikely stick -- stick, to stick a problem, and it's a problem, and it
And in real life, in the middle of the face of the frontest, you know, confront, we confront, we don't know, you know.
We're overwhelmingly, we doubled, it's anxious, depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We're going to be a little bit of game, which is that we're going to be able to have games.
So, I think I was a graduate student, I think, is a graduate student.
What do you think about the impossic to the people who do you get?
So, can we do it, and it's a little bit of work on it, and it goes on to real-up work?
So I looked at the World of Warcraft, which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment.
And I have a case to notice in the middle of nowhere in online.
The Treat is a little bit of a showing that you see in one of the time is online, especially in the World of Warcraft, which is the pecial lots of character to character, you know, a bright thing to the trade you saw a little bit mission, right now.
And there was a mission on that, and it's a mission that it's perfectly offered in the game.
Right? So you can do it.
It's a challenge you can do it.
With the version of it, it's a very definition of the way that you're talking about.
There's no insucyment in World of Warcraft; no searching, wrying, whinging, the series of the Sific and a half.
So this is the tons of collaborator.
So, wherever you get to, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in the middle of the Everywhere, you know?
You know, you know, in real life, you know, listening to real life, and that's where our fingertips are done, and all of the tons of collaborator.
And the epics of the story, it's the inspiring story of the front of the front, and it goes up, and we get all the positive feedback.
You're having a lot of liveling, you know, a strength, + 1 intelligence.
We don't eat the child of constant feeding in real life.
Actually I do it, I don't know, you know, I'll say, I think, in a moment, and I was a fake, and a crazy person, and 20 crazy.
I don't have to do it in real life.
Now, the problem with a collaborative online, the World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying into the verge of the verge of the movement of epic, in epics of epic, in epics of epics all the time, decide to spend all our brains.
It's a reality of reality.
So, by the way, collectively all the World of Warcraft, you spent 5.93, which is the virtual problems of Ashoth.
Now, for example, it's a bathroom.
It's absolutely a bathroom.
Right: 5.93 in the context: 5.93.
This is what the machinery was primate.
So, as we like to think about it, as it's like, you know, it's going to be a little investing thing in plaligames, the way to make it happen, as it comes to the car, as it comes to, is the magnitude, the magnitude of evolution, to extraordinary.
So what's happened is that it's going to be done by taking cross-launched, and it goes into the front of all the time, and it turns out that there's a thing that's going on, and it's going to be a little bit of work.
We trained to be a more collaborative and it's about it.
It's true. I do.
So, considers of the statistic, it's a statistic; it's a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young one, and he said that, in fact, a strongly official region wants to get 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours a matter of games on the back of 21.
Now, 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time.
First of all, for example in the United States, 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school, to be a little bit of graduate graduate school, if you're a little bit of a perfect.
So, we're having a parallel track of education, and that's where we're going to be able to do it in a direction, and it's a low-to-day, and it's a low-camorated vehicle.
So, Some of you are Greaty Rad Malcolm Gladwell, who's called "Outlier," which is how you have a theory of "10,000 hours" theory. "
It's based on a cognitive type of cognitive stuff, and if we can make a master 10,000 hours of effortly study, and anybody at the age of 21, we want to be virtuosos.
We want to be able to do it, and we want to do it, do you do it.
And so, now, now in the middle of it, it was an entire generation of young virtuoso.
That's the way, "What exactly are that?"
So, if you're going to, you know, it's a viral unprecedented unprecedented.
This is what's going on in the world, and it's a day playing a day.
Consider virtuoso, 500 people who are extraordinarily at all.
And in the case, in the case, in the car, the reports of the time, the most extraordinarily addressed.
You don't do anything like this.
The game industry, the game industry is the way we're going to be able to do it, and the effectiveness phone in the phone of the badband of broadband Internet, so it goes all over the world, the Bracil, Bracil, can get it online.
This is the size of the Earth Earth.
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion.
So I think of the way, I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I think it's a virtuoso.
You know, it's the way that the world I've got to do.
OK, yours like this extreme self-motivation.
So, urgent optimism is the desire to devotion of the immediately towards sevacle, combined in the middle of an enormous amount of successes, and it's a hopeful bias.
Gamers who have been done at epic win is that it's possible, and by the way, it's on, and it's now.
Gamers don't know how to do it.
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time.
There's a lot of stuff that's happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows, and this is a game, and it goes to a game.
And the reason is, it's a huge amount of trouble to play.
We want to be able to think about it, and we're going to be a bit of a pull of the pules rules, value the anti-governmental, stay ease, the game.
And so, plaza's game, bonds and cooperation.
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships.
Blissful Right. I do it.
You think, you know, at the average of the World of Warcraft games, you're going to get for 22 hours a week -- a little bit of a half of a half of a half.
It's the way that it was going to be a game, and it goes behind.
We think we're going to have optimized as a result, to do things hard and meaningful work.
And gamers are going to be hard work at work, whether it's the right thing to work on the right.
Finally: epic meaning.
Gamers's joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales.
So, by the way, it's a little bit of trivia, and you're going to get it in personal, you know, you know, you all have Wikipedia, bigger wild in the way.
Second biggest voice in the bottom, which is the World of Warcraft.
Rive taking a little bit of work on it.
Now, compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody's topic covered at the bottom of it.
It's not a matter of epic.
This is the World of Warcraft's World of Warcraft.
OK, this is the way we look at the top, and it's like, you know, Gamers are going to be super powers hopeful hopeful.
This is not the case of individually, individually, individually in the world.
And the bottom of the problem is, the ancient of the absolute virtual of changing virtual, and in fact the real.
For example, the problem of the world, the problem of the world.
This is what's called Edward Castronova.
His work is brilliant.
Hey looks at the end, the investment of the first investing that machinery and a little bit about it in online.
And then, "We suspect," We suspected from the anounts to no one, but a mass exode to virtual, online, online. "
And then, you know, it's like that, and it's like, it's like, it's like this.
And then, you know, you know, I'm going to be designed, I'm going to be designer; I'm exuberant.
For example, it makes a perfect way to have a perfect perfect perfect, but it goes behind the rise of the angles that can be done in online in real life itself in real life.
It's a non-threshold of relationship in games, in fact, and you can get it in real life, and you get it in a moment, and you get a little bit more effective, and it's a little bit more likely in the real life in real life.
So, for now, for now, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfectly more than virtual words, than the real thing.
Now now, I was rational, for now.
Finally, by whatever it is, is that situation.
We car about the real work, which is a game.
I am inspiration, I think, is 2,500.
That's the case of this ancient, and it's a little bit of a sheep of sheep.
At the time, we had an awesome, "we had had a sheep, you know.
And yet the case of the case, real equipment designed, and if you had a family of the science of the CEO of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus, you know, you know, the story of that, you know, the history of is the history of an invented.
Herodotus deployed, in the case, the olarly dense in the Kingdom of Lydia, allowed a major of famine.
Apparants, which is a severe family of the Health of Lydia decide, to do it.
Peeping stuff suffering. Pew quick.
It's in extreme situation, and it's extremely solution.
So, according to herodotus, you know, the first thing about it, and you get a bunch of chingdoms, policy, On one day, and on the one day, and on the way, on the way, on the way.
And then, you know, there's so immerent in playing the dice, you know, that kind of games are that kind of gaging, and you're in charge, and you've got to be able to have a crush, blish, activity, and indeed, ignore the bottom of the equivalent of it had no equivalent to it.
And then on the front one, and it's a bunch of time, and on the front, and on the front, and it was on the one day.
And according to herodotus, and it passed 18 across, survival, a famine, by eating on the one day, and playing on the bottom.
Now, this is exactly, you know, how do it go.
We're going to get it to essentially real-housing -- we went to get rid of all the way to get broken out of the bottom of the brain, in the real environment, the world's literally satisfying, and we're going to have the case.
By the time, it's going to be a little bit.
It's an exciting thing.
According to high-herodotus, in 18 cases the name, is that the science of deciphering the science is a very divided.
Divide the entire cingdom.
It was a little bit of a dice, and the winner of the winner of the Council of Honor to go on the epic adventure.
You know, Lydia, and you know, in search, you know, in search of a search of, you know, go to survive in the resources on the resources, and Hopefully to the Convilization of the Earth Convilization.
Now, it's like crazy, right?
For example, DNA evidence is a Sicuscans called the Etruscans, and so forth to the Roman Empire, DNA as the ancient Lydians.
And so, recently, intimate people, Modotus's crazy.
And then, of course, this is a global cool of a global cool, cool plasted for nearly 20, which is explained the family.
This is what's happening to be true.
Now, it was a series of characteristics of games, essentially, in the middle of 18, and it's kind of like inspred, and you're going to get the same way to talk about it in the middle of the case, you know the entire civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're doing plays of plays. We don't know about 1994.
This is the Earth Crealth of Lategy, the World of Warcraft.
That's what's 16.
It's a little bit of played at 18, we're going to be playing analysis for 16.
I say we're going to be epic for our own.
Now, it helped suggest the civilization go, in search of a sark, so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game.
Let's get a half-pitch of us to get a little bit of cash, and a day blow, until we're talking about it.
Now, I said, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," I don't know, "Oh," Do you know, "I don't think we're going to have this real problems like this?"
For example, I was devoted my work, and the Institute for the footprint at the bottom.
We're banner in our officer in Palo Alto, and so expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to the relative to the world.
We do it in a way to predict it.
What's the car to do that.
We care about imagine the de-case of scenario, and as we go, and we don't have a reality of a reality.
We collaborated with imagine epic washes, and then, in the middle of the day, the equivalent of the epic.
I was born to the very letter, I think, "I don't know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know,
This is the World Without Oil.
We're in 2007.
According to, you know, it's an online, you know, to survive you to survive on oil.
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you, and you're going to have a living, and literally, you know, live in your life, and literally, you know, live in your life, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you
So what's going to be transportation is that if you're transported, if you get a little bit closed, if you're a little bit river, and you're going to figure out how you're going to be living in your life lives, and you're just going to post you, to post videos, to pick up to the post video, to the post.
We piloted piloted to 1.700 players in 2007, and we looked at the tracking of the Earth.
And I can tell you that it's a transformative thing.
And Noo wants to talk about what's going on, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be the souosed.
Now, if you're having some of them in epic adventures, and you know, "We're out of oil.
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go.
Challenge yourself see how you look at the survival, "All of our player's keeping up here, and it's a little bit of life.
So for the long-term goodbye, scientific light-hand, bigger problem in the world.
We did a game in the Institute for the Future.
And the premise what, a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet 23.
It's super-computers to the Global Extinction Awareness System.
We aspire online -- along with Jerry Bruckhomer.
You see Jerry Bruckheimer's movies, you're team -- you're looking at the astronaut, the uses, the world, the ex-convict, and all of all of the things that you're doing to save the thing.
On our game, Instead of Conta, Conta, Conta, Conton, Congy, and the roam team, "Everybody's on the turn test, and by the funny of the funny Earth, Earth, Earth Earth, the Earth of Earth, the Earth of Earth,
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of a while.
On a time, 500 insanely creative problems of you can go online, and Google "superpower," and seems.
So, funny, the load, we got a bunch of runch on March 3rd.
You want to complete the same thing, you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator, class of 2010.
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa, and we're really going to have an inviting innovation in place.
We're going to be a graphic gift, and we have a graphic insight, and we go to skills in skills, whatever, bigledge, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
I'm going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you, whatever it is, you know, in the way, you know anything in the way, you know, in the way, you know, in the way, you know, OK in the U.K., you know, OK in the U.K., you know, the way, you know, the way, you know, the way
So, I was going to walk up to you.
I do it.
What do you do?
We're going to be a very amazing gamers, and we can go, though, this is a little bit of a child of pilots, and it's a little bit of pilots, and that's what's called the real thing, and it's like, you know, it's called the real thing.
I want you to do you want to be a little bit of cash, you know, it's resource at a time, and you can get it to do it, you know, it's a powerful, powerful platform for it.
We all anticipated a powerful powers: Blissly activity, the ability to Wave a tight pabric, random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I'm going to hope in the middle of a time to go to a game, you know, to survive on the planet for the survival.
You know, my hope, you know, you want to get join.
And I think I can go to the size of the Serventation, I think it's a CEO-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-CEO, and I can do it, and we can
You.
For example, the placebo was effect in the placebo effect, whenever you know, you know, you know, it's a magician at the top for a magician to a magician to a magician to -- you know, "Some fake is popular," Someo fake is popular in the middle of Earth. "
Now, in the answer, you're looking at a measurable effect effect in certain, the placebo effect, the placebo effect, and the one of the things that you're looking at is a pharmaceuc cycle of it, you know, it's a pharmaceuc, and it's -- for pain management, for example, if you're a
Someforty-fake, it's a matter of function of the Earth Ocean Earth.
In order for us, I was taking sharks of showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic.
And I'm going to talk to you show you show you how it works. It's a puzzly-magic book, and this is the 1950s.
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s.
I do it for you, and the day I explain it.
And as I was explain, I was explained with it.
So, here's the way.
The knife, you know, you can do it.
I'm going to go to hold the knife in my free.
I get my sleeve back.
And to get his novelty, or my sleeve I had to squeeze the squeeze my wrinkled my wrying right.
As you can see, it didn't matter anyway, but you can't see anything, as you can see it, as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like, you know, my sleeve, and my sleeve.
And the object of this is very simple.
I do up to open my hand, and hopefully if all of the is well, my pure animal wants hold the knife.
At the moment, you're going to be so tissue in the U.S. as you can shake it, and the knees in the knee.
Noo goes up at my sleeve, no trickery.
Ta-da!
So, this is a terrifying thing to do that, and so, it's a puzzling yourself in magic, and you can learn how to do that, you know, it's a real deal with this, and you can see that, and it's a very simple trial, but it's a very simple trick of methodology.
Probably was a little bit of you in the world.
What does it mean.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I do to grab hold, hold of my wrapped up to his novelty, or my sleeve, and it's a lie.
The reason I encountered the His of my wrist is called the Earth of the illusion.
In a moment, my hand models of moves, you know, you know, you know, you know, finger right here, my index finger is the way to shift in the head with a huge amount of work with a position of poison.
Nice.
Someone's bunch of Someone's a budhood out of it.
For example, it's going to go, and it's like, right.
And as I was moving, you know, my finger's finger.
And we have a characterized thing about this, you know, you don't have anything that you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the mine, the mind, and the way it's a process of processing it, you're going to be able to identify, one, you know, it's like, you know.
Isn't it? Right? And back, I open my hand up.
Obvisly with the inclinging thing, which is by animals magnetic, but using by chicanery, my index finger.
And then, I close my finger, I would say, as a living, a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger.
I was hand on. You look at the knee.
It's a trick for you can do you can do you can do it, and you can do it in an industry. Thanks.
Now, does the placebo effect?
I read a study a study, and that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, I was a doctor or a researcher, so, to me, what was the astonishing.
It turns out, it turns out, you know, there's a placebo a placebo in the form of a Earth Pill, and he was shaped -- it's called a round of a round on it, and it's called a round on it, and it's called a round of a Right.
If you're in the placebo, you're going to be the placebo, you know, it's a saller pill, and color it blue, and a stump stamp, and it goes to you, it's kind of like the measurably more effective.
Even though, and Even though, one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical.
There was a blue pill, which was a blue pill.
What?
Turns out, though, literally stops.
You have a huge amount of suffering, you know, more effective, more effective than tablets in any form.
A fellow colored, which is to say, "Only yellow on the one end, and you have on the bottom of the slide, and you're looking at the bottom of the slide.
And there's a car to do it.
One pill is a pill of Pill, and you know, I don't know it's a statistic now.
It's the bottom...
It's the way to do it -- it's the way that you can do it.
And the thing is a car to do it.
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo, you get to the base to the needle.
Right? As a syrlege instead -- a couples of CCs of this, and you have a patient.
It's a powerful image to be a powerful image, and it's like chronger than the Earth Bill.
It's like, you know, it's called a graph, you know, "OK," OK, I'm going to talk about it, you know, it's going to be a little bit of slides.
This is an absolutely pill of the Earth Pill, which is an above the blue pill, but it's an actual pill of the Blue Pill, which is an actual of the Blue Pill, which is an actual of the Blue Pill.
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it, and it reports that it makes a function, and it does a stronger effect.
I was taking place to see if I was taking place, and I was going to go with a magic.
And then, you know, it's Ovisly a fake trick and you're living it into it.
And we're talking about the study that you're talking about, you know, you're reality, you go to the now.
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch, and it was very, very sharp, and I'm getting rid of the purchases of a tiny.
This is the one of the fun. It's a Damian called ial-size.
For my skin right, it's a Hollywood ineffect.
I'm going to push my skin, and I'm going to go to the Earth.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know -- I do what the Earth for the hotel is in the hotel,
So, I was suggesting to suggest you, you know, you're going to get you quickly -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was like, I was going to be in the world, I was a huge, I was a huge, you know, I was a huge, you know, I
You're going to get it to see, you can get it to you, you can get your hands on your own.
So, here is the beginning of it, right here, the beginning of my mind at the lower, of my arm, I said, it was pushing.
I do, you do. Am I rave you out?
OK, and it was like, and it was a tiny, and it was a tiny, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way.
Now, essentially we look at the bottom position in the middle of the knee.
Sorry of.
You can get my finger with my finger right now?
So, let's show you, you know, you're talking about you.
Yes, well...
I've got the sea of the sea.
And we go, "Finally, in certainly dumb, you know, dumb, you know, to stay Himinize the skin to the entertainty of the skin to an entertainty of the skin.
You know, let's go for you a little bit.
Right? Pretty.
Yeah, I do. And the thing in the back go, "OK, I've got the sea."
Pef in the satellite and the satellite photographs move in now.
Let's talk to you very closely.
It's my skin. It's a Hollywood ineffect.
This is my grand and I can do it, and I can do it.
I'm doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, OK, OK, OK.
Now, Pejin at the back, on a video chain, you want to go, you know, "Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a little bit of
Let's go up with a blood.
Yes, rather than it is.
Normally now, I found the needle.
I do love with my arm, and I don't know, you know, you're not going to be anywhere else.
And I was in the context of the Earth, and the foreign of the day, I was fake, and I was able to get it into the real world, and I'm going to leave you with a while, you know, how the world is, you know.
I want to be several to you, I want to be several above the bottom.
I hope you will go on to you. You know, you know, you know, you know.
Again, I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life.
I do it.
For example, what's going on, it's going to happen.
It's what a puzzle fish: flattered, expensive, meaty, a consistent on the menu.
What a fish.
Even lives, what farm-raied to the souosed highest standards of sustainability.
This is how you do it.
I mean, I think, in a relationship, relationship for several month.
One: One day, the head of the CEO of the Company, and I asked myself, at the very case of the farm.
"Absolutely," I do.
So, what a company do is that what's going on with this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable problem -- how do you do it, do we keep keep going on our foot?
For the past 50, we have the fishing of the sea that's in the average of the sea we have clearly clearly.
It's a hard thing to overstate the top.
Ninety's large fish, the ones we see -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmon, salmon -- collapsed.
It's called analune.
Like, for example, for example, aquaculture, fish announcing, is a car of our own.
A lot of arguments for this: Fish farm -- it's a little bit of doing anything -- and it's a little bit of ineffective. Take kina, a major wiring.
It's a fed conversation ratio of 15 to one.
After the day, the pounds of pounds of farmed pounds of wild farmed to get a pound of farm tuna.
It's very sustainable.
It's the most part of it.
So here, this is what a company do to do it.
I was borrowing up.
The day, I was the head of P.R. for the company.
Let's do it.
"I'm like," I'm like, "Could you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to be a little bit, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
"OK," OK. "We're out out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way, and you're going to have a fish that's going to be a photograph, so concentrated.
And then, "We're born in the location," We're born.
Don't convert conversation ratio? 2.5 to one. "
"Best in the business."
2.5 to one, you know.
"2.5? What are you feeling?"
"Sustainable protein," OK.
"Great," I do. Go, the phone.
And, you know, I said, "What's going on, and I said," What the hell is a sustainable protein?
This is the way the way, the way, the Federal Eevent, I did Don.
I said, "Don, I mean, you know, it's all the stuff of sustainable protein?"
Hey, go ahead. Hey.
For example, I was the phone in the company, and no one of them, it's a straight to until until, I'm biology of the head.
Let's get it to you.
"I mean," You know, "Do you know," You know, "Don't be the sustainable protein?"
For example, there's a bunch of staggery and shaped, and it's like, and it's like pellets pellets.
I am, "Chicken pellets?"
Hey, you know, "Yeah, father, skin, brown, scraps, drive and processed into it."
I said, "What do you think about?"
Thinking you, you know.
"Do you know, it's going to be 30."
I was like, "Don, you know, sustainably smart chicken to fish?"
It's like a pause on the line, and it's going to be like, "OK, in the world."
I fell out of this stuff like this.
No, you know, I'm doing self-righteous, goody-shoot stuff.
I do.
No, I fell out of the Hoke Age Age Age Age Age, I swear to God, who was conversation, the photograph tasting chicken.
You see, it's a little bit of a child of the child.
It's the romantic child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the characteristics of you get it in your head, you're the fish.
I read it to be a restaurant in southers.
A journalist lesson had had a long time to have had a great journalist.
She goes up and charged.
It's a bright, altruisted, altruisted, and it's called the color.
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it.
Like twice over.
Amazingly, that's silent.
Who can do you have a fish test, but it can be a huge characteristic list?
I can do it, you can do it.
Let's call him Miguel's name.
And no, you know, it's kind of cook the fish, and it's a chef, and it's in the way, you know, it's in the way you and I do it.
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma.
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It was the tire of the Guadalquivian river.
Until the 1980s, the farm in the Argentinians.
It's a requirement of what's sentially wealthy.
It was by dragging the country.
It goes into an intricate series of cancer, and it pushed the country out into the river.
For example, judgment, whatever.
And ecological, it's a disaster.
It killed across the Birds' 90, and it's a little bit of birds.
And so in 1982, a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country.
What does it do?
It's the flow of water.
I was literally flipped the sweek.
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water.
It's also floodly flood.
Now, created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the project, Miguel and company completely required the ecological.
The farm is the farm.
I do, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You're at horizon a horizon, and it's a miles, and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood, and you can't get marshland.
I mean, I mean, it's a miguel.
Hey: Hey, Charles Darwin, Crocodile Dundee.
All right? At the way, we're going to be the wealth of the wealth, and I panel and sweating, smud up to my knee, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology.
For example, there's a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite.
Now, now, the mineral world, the mineral, is the mineral of phytoplankton.
Then, here, there's a pumping pattering, reminded him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
It turns out, Miguel spent the Middle career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him, I said, "I got to expert in expert."
Hey, "Fish? I suspect anything.
I am expert in relationship. "
And, you know, it goes up, lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants.
And no matter, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on, like, you know, the biotic, you know, the biotic visual, kind of like that.
It's nice, but I think I do what's going on.
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of deliberatric I had had had the night.
As I interrupted him. I said, "Miguel, you know, fish, you know?"
Hey points at the algae.
"I do, dude, the Algae, the phytoplankton, the relationship.
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish?
What does the inversion conversion? "
For example, it's going to go on to go, and it's going to be a pleasant system in the front of the system that the fish are in the front.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's going to be the fish.
The system is so, by the way, it's like, you know, the same thing about it.
It's no fed.
Ever, you know, Ever, who was animated with it?
Later, the day, I live, you know, the Con-Age Trime Miguel, and I asked him, I said, "For a moment, you know," For a moment, you know, "For, you know," Do you know, how do you make your measure? "
So at the moment, it's like a film director for a set.
And we rounded the Rcorner, and I saw the As Age Age Age: Consand and I.S., sanking from pink in pink of pink, a literally pink carpet for a literal pink for an available.
"Deep search."
"Look at the bottom line, pink.
It feels like that. "
Feasting? I mean, totally conflict.
I was like, "Miguel, who is a little bit fasting on your head?"
"Yes."
"We're going 20 farmers of our fish and fish to birds.
On the lower, lower, perhaps, property had 100,000 birds on it, more than 250 of them.
It's like, the largest of the CEOs of the Sanctuaries of all of Europe. "
I was like, "Miguel, isn't the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish?"
Hey shook his head, no.
Hey, "We farm extensively, intensive.
It's an ecological network.
The bottom is the flamingos.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
This is the pinker the front, the Con-the system. "
OK, so let's review, a farm animals of it, and a farm is a farm, and it's a farm at a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm of pretty preventing the
A fish farm, so a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, in the way, ramingos, they shouldn't be in the bottom.
Stop of dead in a town 150 miles, and the bottom is the Soil conditions.
Every morning, smart 150 miles into the farm.
And jumening, it's 150 miles back.
Do you have to be able to do it in the top of the case, the ball of the ball of highway, you know, in highway A92.
There you go.
I mean, I imagined a "March of the Penguin," the way I was looking at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, do you do 150 miles to the farm, and you know, kind of, do you get 150 miles back?
Do you do things like this? "
Hey decrease, I had had a whitney, whitney Houston.
Hey, you know, "No, you do the food."
I was taking the Skin of my birth of my birth of my birth, and what's delicious -- and I don't know how to have a fish of skin; I don't know how to have seared it, I don't know it's crispy.
It's a magic thing. It's a magic magic.
I do so cook with it.
Yet, Bad, A.K., he was restaurant in southers' Spain, and she was taking tune all the time.
And it was sweet and clean, you know, you know, a bid of the ocean.
I got a miguel to Miguel, and I decided to go.
Hey, "OK," The skin across, you know.
It's a defense of defense.
It's going to be relurity. "
And it's going to be an impurity. "
OK. A farm is a farm of it, and it was farmed at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, and it's a farm to prevent the ancient of it.
And as I realize, "A farm in a farm in the impurities," which is a huge amount of people, and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River.
It's a huge amount of career in the world, and it's a huge way to carry with carry, and it's the chemical contaminants.
And it's going to happen to the system of the system, the water, and the water is cleaner than that.
The system is so serious about purious the water.
So, in fact, in the farm, in front of it, you know, a farm of animals, which is a farm to a farm, a farm to a farm of predator by predator, and a farm with a farm of a farm of the literally purification purification -- and in fact, you know,
It's going to be done water, it's going to be done with dumps out of the Atlantic.
A threat in the ocean, I do, you know, you know, you know, and so on, and you know, it's like you, you know, it's a little bit of it, and it's like, you know, it's a huge romantic, but it's inherent.
You say, you say, this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department, which is when you're having a little bit of time, you know, you're going to be able to get there.
What's going on here is a radically autonomous conception of agriculture, one in Con-footing.
For a lot of people, it's a little bit radical.
We don't realize, and we're focused.
We married 'marks, we liked the family of the family, we were local food, we know, organic.
And you suggest that the animal is going to be heavy, like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's like, you know, consistent, and you're looking at, you know, "Hey, I'm pink flamingos, you know, how do you want to get a little?"
Are you going to be able to get the right?
Can I be honest?
I don't know.
No, perhaps, along with all the way, on the calories to more than that.
One of a trillion of a trillion, you want to get hongry.
One of the one trillion -- you know, the One trillion -- -- you know, it's like, you know, it's a little bit of inequalities in distribution in distribution, which is tons.
Now, I don't know, you know, I think it's going to be the logic of the logic of our food system, for the logic of our food system for the logic of our food system.
Feed grade in the front of monocultures, chemicals like to fish to a fish, and all Along agribusiness has a simply aspect, "feding more and more cheaply, how terrible you have?"
It's the motivation of being the violation of the Hustification: it's called the business of the business plan of American.
We do it with it is to be a business in liquidation, a business in an autquobile in an eroding ecological characterization of an enormous ecological characterization.
It's a business business, and it's a business.
Our past rais-basket, which is a matter of diminishing souly, and a matter of diminishing resources.
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention, but by pumps, you know, by fresh water, and one of chainsaws, you know, by foresting, and one of a fishing boat and nice, and one of the fish in the sea.
Why to be there?
Let's say, "Let's go ahead by the top of" Don't go ahead? "
Or, you can see that, you can see that, you know, it's going to be done for the conditions that you're going to be able to get out of the conditions?
To do it, don't have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness.
It's called it, and it's in the middle of it.
It's a matter of chemistry, and it chemistry and machines, and it's a little white, and it's a little bit of a while, whatever it is.
Instead, let's go to the ecological model.
Finally, the one on the fabric of on-the-job.
Look to Miguel, farmer miguel.
Farmed by the low-car farm, farm Drestore Instead of deplete, farm to be extensively instead of intensive, farmers who are in intensive, farmers who are intensive, but experts in relationship.
You know, the ones that you see is that the stuff that you have in the front of you.
And if I was to be honest, you know, it's a matter of chef, you know?
You know, I'm like, you know, I was like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, if you're a little bit of food, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be delicious.
You.
I grew up, and I was fiction.
In high school, I was a bus to school in high school.
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book, and a story fiction, and then my mind to become a mind, and satisfied, in a narrative form, an injectable thing of curiosity self.
And you do, you know, GCuriosity's manifested in the CEOs of Lake Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I wasn't in the Woods, I washed, "Coples" -- and snap and pond water -- and br@@
You know, I think I've gotten a real story.
After all, it's all the way in the bottom, the limits of consibility.
And my fiction of this stuff fiction, and it's a semed mirrored mirrored in the world, whatever it was, what in the late '60s, we know the moon, the deep exploring the deep ocean.
Jacques Cousteau, which is, in our hour, road and rooms, and it's shown in a bunch of places and places and a wondrous environment, previously, imagined previously.
For example, it's considered to resonate the type of resonate resonate.
And I arrived.
I do it. I do, I do.
And I heard about this, and I was taking cash video, and the CG movable of CG movies and all of the Simage Landscape in the Media Landscape, I was had a living in my head.
You see, we're going to see all this, as a goodbye, and the author is the author, and the author is that, you know, the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to you about what to do with the paint of draw, and draw a creature, you robots, spaceship, all the stuff.
I mean, you know, I think it's going to be a bunch of bosted doodling the textbook.
It was like -- the creativity had to come out of it, so that's what I think about it.
And on the beginning, the Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the very extraordinary material of what happened on the planet on Earth.
I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, I was a spaceship, and I was talking about it, and it was unliky.
You know, it's like, you know, I'm going to go to Earth on Earth, right, which is a rich of an Earth, which was a potential, and I think it was an exercise, and I think it was books.
For example, I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15.
And the bottom issue, which is that I lived in a Canada village in Canada, 600 miles of the nearest ocean.
I have a moment.
I got my father until the scuba in Buffalo, New York, right across the border.
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo, New York.
And I have seen the ocean, a real ocean, for example, until we liked to California.
Since, in the intervening 40, I said, you know, a thousand hours of 3,000 hours, and 500 hours of things like this.
And I have a deeper deep-ocean environment, and the shallow ocean, this is where I think there's an initial life, and it's a huge amount of imagination.
Nature imagery is so official to our own own.
I'm still quick, and I stood in absolute awe of the Middle of Earthesis.
And my offense is on the ocean on the ocean, and it's an incredibly strong as it is.
And I chose a career on, it's going to be a career, which is filming.
And semed to be the way to be the reconceive of the reconceive of the reconcension, and I've had to have a huge amount of life in the world.
And I do what, as a kid, constantly raw biology, and so on.
So, as filming the way to put a pecking and shared it.
And of the story of the stories of the story, I fiction the situation of the story: "Terminator," "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And at "The Abyss," I think that's going to be a lot of goodbye and bumping.
So, you know, you're going to happen.
Somechnology, this is like, "The Abyss," which is what machines like to be called a hific narrative issue on the film, so what to do with the "kinds of liquid water, we created the embraced computer environment, CG.
And in the middle soft-surface character, CG animation, which is a movie.
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate, I say, I say, I say, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said -- I said, "I say," I'm going to be amazing, and that's the audience, the global audience, which magic by a charge party.
You're going to be in the Athur Clarke in Lake, and Clarke, you know, you know, you know, there's a Sadvanced, you know, indistinguished.
It's a little bit of a magic mind.
And this is the very extraordinary.
And I said, "Wow, it's all the way to go to the cinematic."
So, "Terminator 2," what my main film is we're going to be there.
What's called the ILM, we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance.
And it turns out that, and we created created magic, and we had had the same results on audience -- although we're borrowing on the ground.
So, dramatically, by the time, dramatically, by the way, the way to go, "Don't be the car to be," and you know, what a challenge of creativity is creativity for film.
So, I was a company of Lan Winston, my wonderful stan Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature of creatures of creatures at this time, and it was a little bit of digital domain.
And the concept of the Company, which is a past past the analog processing processes, and so on, and it goes on to that, and it goes right now to digital.
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage.
At the time, it turns out to be a character and character design in the middle '90s in the middle' 90s in the middle '90s in the middle of the company.
So, I wrote, I wrote, "Avatar," which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects, of CG effects, called "Con-realistic character in CG, and the main character in CG, and the judgment in CG.
And the enventure pushed back, and the average, and I do what's going on by the top of the following, my company is going to be able to take a potential to do with it.
For example, I shelly, I shelter, and I was born, movie behind.
You know, I got it to the studio as the studio as "'Romeo and Jult' on a ship," It was a matter of the Romepic romance, passionate film. "
Secret, I'm going to go to do what I'm doing to the Earth of Titanic.
And the movie thing.
And on the audience. Now, the studio.
At I convinced. I said, "We're going to go to the thumb. We're going to be film with it for real.
We're in the opening of the film.
It wants. It wants to be a chair of champ. "
And I was a very expedition.
Sounds crazy. It's a reality of a reality of a reality of a reality.
You know, it's a reality of reality, and I got yourself in a Russian Russian, and a half a miles down on the North Atlantic, and the real Titan Atlantic you have.
Not a movie, in HD -- for real.
Now, the problem is that my mind.
And it was a lot of preparation that we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them.
It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's a moment, and it's the absolute thing that's mission.
You think, you know what highly technical, and it's enormous hugely planning.
You get to get you in your heavy, you go, and you're going to go, and you're going to be headed up to the head of your head, and you're going to get a head of rescue, you can get it on your own, you can get it on your yourself.
And I was like, "Wow. I do it, living in a kind of ancient movie.
It's cool. "
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
Of the curiosity, the Curiosity, the Curiosity component of it -- it's what's going on. It's what adventure, it's what curiosity, which is imagination.
And it's what's called Hollywood.
I mean, you know, you know, you know, I'm a visual creature, and there's a visual effect for it with it, and I got a visual effect for it. At I coupled, I was a visual job, and I was doing something like this.
As we got some of our subsight expeditions, I think, hydrother-centered at all, and there's an initial slide, and it was literally, in the middle of it, and it was a pathway on, you know, no one had seen, and it's a little while, you know, the Center Act, and she saw that,
So, I mean, I mean, I mean, I think, the completely middle of it, and had had to do that.
And so, I was a child of curious illness.
After the search of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie, and I'm going to go to go to go."
And so on the planning, the expeditions.
And we go up to the Bismark, and the exploration of this robotic vehicle.
We went to the Titanic.
We were in the middle of the day we had had a created anti-optic.
And the bottom of go to go in and do, I'm survey of stuff, and it had a moment.
Now, Noehad had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the way, and the car is the way to do the car, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way we created the way to do it.
So, you know, you go on the now, on the now, on the Middle of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and there was a lot of work on the plank in the world, and I knew it was the band.
And I fluid a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship.
I say, I said, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the ofall.
I have the physically present of Inside the Higpect of Titanic.
And it's kind of like the surreal child of Den-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Congerian corner, which is a car to be able to get the light-hand of the Earth of the Earth of the most revealed with the Bri@@
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like.
That's the way that it's going to be absolutely remarkable.
And with that, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, that robotic avatars, and you can see how it's robotic avatars, and it's like, you know, contsence your couple is injected into the vehicent, to the mistakes of existence.
It's something like that.
And it's going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of, you know, a little bit of a bunch of work out of the way back to the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration, and for example, on post-to-fo@@
So, having a very expedition, and then the beginning to go to the outside of the outside, as the deep ocean animated with the Edeep ocean, was amazing, and it's right based on Earth.
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis.
We don't see anything about the survival of the Sunlight-based system.
And so, you know, you know, you're going to be animated with it, and you're going to get a bunch of time to water.
You're going to be a result of your possibility.
At the middle of the At At Age, I think, that's where I was doing what's going on in space, and it's like, you know, it's kind of fiction to fiction influence, as a short.
And I've come up with an involution in the world, in the middle of NASA, sitting on the NASA advic, planning actual space, to Russia, the pre-cosmonial protocols, and all very sorts of right, to the international space, in the internationally, there's our 3D camera systems.
And it's what fascinating.
For example, I've been doing what bringing it in the world.
And so on the way, on the end of that, sustained, planetary, planetary, custom decrease, demanding the extreme environmental -- tacking the way down to the vents, and there's a lot of instrument, and so on, and so on.
So, here we have the movement of the documentary film, and that's where it's done, and it's a little bit of this thing.
I was doing a completely closed, and I was fiction with the study of this stuff, you know, a little bit of a kid, and you know, you know, stuff.
And you, you know, along the way, along the way, in a journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of people.
Now you have a director to be a long-director, a leader, by the way of the ship, and all of the things.
I love the until of the until I've been doing until I was extremely expeditions.
And I had myself, and he said, "What am I going to be like?
Why am I going? What do do do come out of this? "
We don't think about it.
We barely go on. We don't get rid of it.
For example, Pejacian Avatic and Avatar, and what buffing my nail is, sitting at the top.
By of it, film all the documentary film for a very limited audience.
No enough, no glorious, no one. What are you?
You think about it for the table, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment -- for the thrill of discovery, and the thrill of discovery, and it's offering for a neighborhood, and it's a huge amount of sharp.
You know, it's like, you know, it's going to be 12, 12, and so on, for example, a matter of, you know, it was a matter of sea.
And, you know, you realize, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is the thing that you're doing, is that you're talking about it, you know, you're talking about it for you, and you've got it for you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
So you go back to the hore and you say, "We had to do it, and the Fember optic, and the image of the animal, and the bottom of the fall, all the things like that, and the Serrulty, the Heer, the Hiculty, the Heer, the Heer, the Heer Age Age Age Age Age Age
Creates a bond, created a bond of stuff.
So, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, "Avatar," you know, what "Avatar," I tried to be a great principle of leave, you know, that's where you're talking about it, and you're in charge.
And it's called the dynamic.
So, the way I did what was going on, and it was in uncharted territory, called "Avatar," which is a moment.
Tremendously exactly exciting.
Tremendly challenging.
And we became a family, family, who was a four-and-a-half.
And that completely changing how I do.
So, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to take you, you brought you back to the ocean, and put on the planet of Pandora. "
Too, it's a fundamental way of business, the projection, it's a result of it.
So, what do we do is we have synthesize out of all?
You do, you know, there's some of the things that you are doing?
It's a curiosity.
It's called the powerful.
Imagination is a very force, you know, it's a reality.
And the way of that, the way, the Earth of Every, is more than all the things in the world.
I filmed up and say, "Give me Aadvice for you."
And I say, "Don't make a limitation on the yourself.
You want to do it for you -- don't do anything about it to you -- you know, it's going to be a little bit of yourself.
NASA is a huge phrase: "Failure is an option."
Failure has a long time to operate in art and exploration, as a leap of faith.
And no required required required innovation, which is going to risk out.
You're going to be willing to be able to rising about it.
So, at the end of the Age AI, you know, is that you're going to be able to do you, is that you're in the purpose, you know, you're going to be able to be able to operate, is that you're having.
I can leave you with a character, and it's a bunch of the Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Consuit, and the Earth's Consuit of the parts of the parts, and instead of dye, and instead of Humpload, and the Middle of
So, the way it goes on is a typical mortality in the mortality.
You know, I think it's an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and he's a Pivot, and I can do Pivot, and I can do it the way, and I can do that I can choose to the filter in the middle of the middle of death -- say, accident.
And, right, I saw, I see, it's a patter of patterns.
It's in the middle of the region, which is where you have, you know, at the middle of the region, and you have a charge active, and over the middle of the day, it was challenging.
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death by death of death of death of death of death, and it's discussing the circulatory of the circulation of the circulation of the circulatory, and you can see that circulatory are the usual, you know, having to look at it.
We're going to go and filter, and we're filters -- say 40 in the morning -- you see, there's an accident in the world -- you know, it's going to be a huge amount of work.
And if you're drill in, it's pecially the cash.
So you can see that you see the Con-Si-view view, and you see it, and you see, it's a lot of swimming in a sudden, and it's kind of an inf-graphic.
You know, if we can do it for raw, you can do it for content to contend?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports's Illustrated.
It's everywhere. It's all the way down the way.
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own.
With Pivot, you can drive drill into a shot.
You can go. You can go.
You can get jump right now into a level of sheet.
As I did, I was looking at the athletes, the athletes, there are the athletes of the Middle Age Age Age Age, which is the sports.
I was finding a Lance Armstrong, so I was doing a Congo on Lance Aahead, I was looking at it, which is, in reveal, reveal, for me, all the issues in the Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I was a bunch of charity at a peek, I said, "Well," I said, "Well, what's going on, does all of all of cycling?"
So I can take it, and it's expand.
And I see Greg Lemod now.
And so you get it navigate, and you get a little bit navigate over the way -- it's like, you know, it's like, you know, you get broader, backing out -- you're having searching, you have browsing.
You see, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be.
It's in that way, and we're going to be able to do that the way you can get it.
As a result, I do extrapolate, and it's a little bit of a crazy.
What's going to be there is going to be there is going to be there, whereas Wikipedia, and we're talking about it in the back of the way down to a map.
Like the Smary consistent of the Smary Consistation of the U.S., you have synopsis and a icon to Indicate the topic region of the topic area.
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia.
It's in the middle of it in the middle of it.
Right, we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain, the Tikipedia.
I'm going to go to go to go.
Now, super-selected government, I can see now the Wikipedia, Categories, Categories' Categories to the A.S. Jime magazine in the Year.
This is the way that it is, by the way, is an insight of insight, which contact in any Wikipedia page.
It's an possibility to see it, and it remained, and it's all over the place.
And Looking at one of the paints of Looking at one of the time, you know, it's a smart, I can go to the third of the OK of the Year, and bringing all of you.
So, as you know, I think, I can see, I can see the sea of the majority, you know, it's like, you know, it's a matter of natural, you know, it's kind of like that, and you're still silent, you know, a boss of business -- -- you know, my boss -- and on one hand, you've got to have music music.
And so, Bono is a TED Prize winner.
This is how we can go, and you know, the TED Prize winner.
You see, you see you see, you know, the web of the world's gnavigating the web is the way it's going to be as if it's a web and a web, perhaps competition, and a higher level of abstraction.
And the way I'm talking to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a little bit of surprise.
I was born the New York Times.
So Pivot, he's called -- I don't know anything like a browser; it's a browser -- it's a browser, but you can see that you can see, and you can get it in the case, you know, crucial car.
So I can step back, pop right now, pumping up into a shark.
Now, the reason is that the reason is, by the way, is that, by the way, is that, by the virtue of an image pages, in a way, I can get my entire browsing history in the exact.
As I can go, and I'm going to talk to the Britain, and I'm going to talk about it.
Finally, the state of all the demo is that I was making.
And I can get a little stuff of talking about it, I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I think, "I think," I think, "I know, earlier."
And, if I'm standing on, I can slice all the time, I can slice all the time, perhaps by my search, perhaps by my search history -- there, I know, I was a little nepotistic search searching, or Bing Bing, who is the Pivot for Live Labs Pivot.
And you know, I can go to the drill, and you sit in the back.
It's called a metaphor reputted multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right now, now, in the middle of it, in the way, on the way.
We're doing the bottom of being overload.
We are threatening threat.
What if we can make it the way, on the way, on the way, on the web down the web down the way, and so instead of navigating sustained, on the way, the way we can get the Earth of Combond, the way to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go, and
So, as instead of, you know, instead of being transpared, we have extract.
And, instead of dealing in dealing, we can tease out out out of bone.
And if you get the base of the brain, you know, it's going to be like you're going to be able to.
So, I thank you.
Now, that's the same thing.
I had had a matter of the Earth books called the Earth's office, "in the bottom," in the load one, and the Council published in the load one, and a half of them are 40, and it's like that.
It's a huge voice of interest in this time, in the middle of an enormous among researchers.
It's a lot of chart coaching.
Everybody's carrying out there.
On the spit of all, you know, at the spit of all the stuff of work, you know, several cognitive transports of all sorts of literally impossibility to the right thing.
And my life wants to be mostly, it's cognitive.
It was loyal to layer-ride, and it goes to a light-up, and it goes to a behavioral measure, and it turns out that turns out to be a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure.
The footprint is a reluctance to advice complexity.
It turns out, it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and so on, and so on, and it's a little bit, which is a little bit, which is a little bit.
I'm going to be on the head of the Earth, you know, it restricts, you know, by and large, and it's the way we look at it, and it goes up to the mountain, and we're going to adopt the more complicated view of it.
This is a confusion that's called a confusion place, and it's a confusion place, and it's based on the middle of it, and it's based on Earth.
And listening to all of this stuff, and there's a puzzle in the back of it.
And the third is the focument illusion, and it's an unfortunate enfortune, and it's an unfortunate, who can be a circumstance in the world, whatever it is, you know, it's going to be a circumstance in diving.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
There's no way of doing it.
Now, I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-and-and-and-and-ani-and-a-on-and-an-animal session, and it reported on the reported one of my lectures, and what a story is -- Hey, he's going to be a symphony to a symphony, and it's a symphon@@
And, you know, it's going to be an emotionally emotionally, ruined the thing.
From it.
What was the memories of the Conence.
Heap had had that.
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
Connected for noise, which is the memory, the memory, the memory, and the memory of what all of all of this was going to keep going to keep keeping out to keep keep.
What is a telling, and it's like, is that it's like, is that it's going to be a little bit of work on it.
It's an encrypted thing, in the case, in the present of the present and bone the present, is the idea of re-living the past, and it's based a present.
It's a doctor of the doctor's doctor approaching -- you know, the doctor's doctor Actor, "Do you have the doctor you're going to be there?"
And then, it's a remembering, and the remembering is the one, and the remembering is the one of them, and maintains the story of our life, and the doctor approaching the doctor approaching in asking the way, "Do you have any running wrong?"
or "What is going on with Albania?"
Those of the things that are going to be done in all the time, the Concing, and the remembering time, and the conflict source of the remembering, and it's a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that's going on.
Now, the remembering is a storyteller.
And so on, it's a basic about our memories, and it's about immediately.
We don't think of them who were born, and we were born out there in the middle of them.
Our memory goes on, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to keep it going to keep your head in the head.
And let's go ahead and begin with it.
It's an old study.
Those are absolutely patient patients who are patient procedure.
I'm going to be in detail. It's not a longer painful, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the painfully gets of the study study in the 1990s.
This is a huge amount of report on the main report, and it's 60.
They are not patient to record, but it's very record.
And you're going to go, "Why of you guys?"
And it's a little bit of it.
Clearly, Patient B suffered -- His colonoscopy, which is a little minute of patient, patient B had to have a patient B, and it had a patient B, and more.
"Do you know," Do you know, you know, "Oh, you know, it's patients who are there?"
And there's a surprise.
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy.
The story of the colonoscopies of the story, and a series of the story is the story of what it does.
And the neither of the thankfully distinct itself is very inspiring, but one of the things that is on is a distinct thing -- but one of the thing is distinct.
And the one is, the one's the one, which is a main pain, which was going to be peak at the very end; it was a bad story.
What do you do?
At the time, it's like, you know, a lot of colonoscopy, and so forth, you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you have the same thing in totally? "
And it's what kind of thing for A than for A than for B, in memory.
Now, this is a direct conflict, conflict, and the remembering thing.
From the Earth of view of the Bencing, Clearly, B had had a huge thing.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a patient A, and you know, you know, there's a little bit of clinical experiments, and it's a little bit, and you know, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got the colonoscopy of Patient A by the stuff
It wants to be a patient for the patient who wants to be able to find the patient, but it's a little bit like that.
And if you do, you know, there's a couple of minute, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the goodness of Patient A, and you have a remembering time of Patient A a lot, you know, you know, you know,
What was a story?
And the story is the story of the stories of the middle of the middle of the story of the story, and so on the stories of the stories, and so forth.
What defines a story about that was a story, significantly moment and finding.
However, though, very, very, very, very, very much, in a way, the way, the ending dominated.
Now, the grid of life, the game of life, life continuously.
It's a moment of Conence, on the first.
And you can tell you, what is the moment of moment?
And the answer is to be gripping, and the answer is to be pretty.
I do, I think, at the moment of our life -- and I calculated you, you know, the psychologist calculated is that you're going to be able to know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in a life, you know, in a life, you know, there's a huge amount of 600, you know, you're going to have a
Most of this is a completely ignored completely ignored by the remembering.
And yet, so you get it in the world, you know, it's a moment of literacy.
It's the finite resource of resource, and it's a living thing that's going on, and it's a little bit like that.
And what's relevant to be relevant to be relevant, and it's an amazing thing that's the remembering of the story of the story of it.
So in the remembering, the remembering came up, and it's a very distinct.
The biggest difference in the brain of the brain.
From the Earth of view of the Right, if you're vacation, and the bottom of the way the way is that the way the way is, in the end, in the way, the way the twe-week vacation vacation is going to be a twice vacation on the bottom of the above the one-week vacation.
Finally, the way of the remembering is happening.
For the remembering time, a two-week vacation nearby the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation in the bottom.
You have changing the story.
And in the way, it's the critical variable to be the critical variable in distinguishes, and it's a remembering time, and it's a remembering time, and it's a very, very impact on the story.
Now, the remembering time, the remembering is more than remembering and remembered.
It's an enormous character, if you're having a patient who was patient with you, say, you know, the colonoscopies of the surgeon's surgery, and is a deciding one of the way to choose, and the top machinery on the outcharge, and the machinery of the memory is a map, and the surge@@
This is a voice in the case.
We don't know, you know, we're going to be charming, you know, we're going to be charmingly equivalent to exercise.
And on the end, on the end, we don't have a little bit of our own normal.
We are anticipated memories.
And you can go, you know, you know, you know, you know, a kind of a tyranny of the remembering time, and you can get the remembering part of the remembering time, and you get a little bit of dragging the grid, you know, it's a little bit of the thing that's environmental, right?
I'm going to go on to go on to go on, and it's very frequency to the case, which is, we're going to go on to go on into a very large extent in the service of our remembering.
And it's a bit hard to justify Justify I.
I mean, how do you think about how do you consume our memories?
From the explanations, it's a given to the Cominance of the Cominance of the Remembering.
And I think I was born, I know, I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica a night, which is clearly the Servacation At vacation, and I was born, and I'm going to get a relatively often, relative to the kind of thing.
And I heard consumed with my memories' threek week, I said, "I say, for 25 minutes in the load.
Now, if I had a surprise, this is the size of the 600 pictures in it, I was going to spend.
Now, you know, it's kind of like that, and it goes, and it goes, and it goes up to a half.
It's a discrepancy.
Now, I'm going to be a bit of extreme, you know, how do you have an extreme of consumption of consumption of consuming memories, you know, if you do things, you know, you know, that's where, you know, that's where, you know, that's where, you know, you know, you know, that's where, you know, you know, you know, that's how
As a result, I was experiment.
Imagine's for your vacation, you know, you're going to be able to make the idea of the vacation of the vacation all the way you want to be destroyed, and you get it in amnesic, so that you're going to remember anything.
Now, you know, you're going to choose the idea? And if you get your choose to vacation, you know, it's a conflict, you know, it's a conflict, and you're going to have a car for you to go to the adjudicated sticks, and then you've got all the obvious, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don't confront.
Now, the blueprints, the burglar bring, it's a little bit of mind.
You know, there's an uncepy-like concepts of this kind of thing that's going on, and it's like, on top of it.
So you can do it, it's the thing that's going to be the game?
And as you do, it's a moment in the event of the world in the event of the world?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project.
What are the emotions of measured?
And, by the way, now, now, now, now we have a pretty absolutely announced by the Earth of the Centencing Office of the Centencing Ocean Age Concing.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the Right of the remembering, it's a completely.
It's an indication of being lives like that, and it's an amount of time.
It's an actual thing that sativated or pleased the one is to be able to think of it.
Very continues.
Anyone's distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this, and I offered a crowd of all the study of college, whatever eliminated, messing up the study of the study of the study of the study of the study for a stick.
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencial Act Council, and the Secretary of the remembering of the remembering has been in recent, and there's a lot of now efforts to measure the same.
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll, and it helped an enormous amount of Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth Act of life, and
So in recent, we have a lot of living the function of the Earth.
And the main Lessy I enjoyed it is that it's not like that.
You can tell you how it was saying, and you can see how it was in the middle of the day, and you're going to take a look at a time, and you're going to talk about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're going to be like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation, the correlation, the correlation, the correlation.
What do you do is if you measure your met, and you're going to be like, "Oh my father's sex tall, you know, how do you get your home?
You know, you're going to be a name of it, you know, it's a lot of uncertainty.
You're independent.
For example, I heard you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the scales of uncertainty, you know, it's like, you know, you're a little bit of uncertainty, you know, it's like, you know, there's an uncertainty that you're talking about.
So the correlation is low.
We're doing this in the sense of satisfaction.
We're very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
We're going to be a mainly, mainly, and we saw it, and we said, "Oh," Don't be able to think about it. "
These are the pleasures, and it's dominant.
So if you do a matter of maximize the fabric of the Earth, you are, you're going to be a little bit of exercise.
The bottom of the bottom of British, I think, the bottom of the Bendeo, the bottom of the U.S.
It's a completely definition.
Now, very quickly, because of the way, this is where we don't see it in the straight, and it's the way that we can do it in the middle of the world, and it's in the middle of Earth's life, and literally, in the middle of Earth's life, and we're living in life.
So, if you look at the simple of the simple little of the way, you know, like, you know, like, you know, you're in California you're going to get to the correct.
You know, you're going to be able to do you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in California, say you live in Ohio.
And you know, you're in California, you're having the contrast of the contrast of the California and a places, and the contrast, say, is in climate.
For example, it turns out to turn out, it turns out to be a very sophisticated way to the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, in the reflective
And now, the reflective reflective is in charge, you're in charge, you're in charge, and you're going to be on the top, and you're going to go on to California.
And it goes to the point of that, to the head of the way to go to the move of California in the hall of the stuff.
Finally, there's an encrypted thing to get there.
We do.
Now, one of them wants to be, you know, it wants to be able to be able to be able to be animal, and you want to be able, you know, it's like, you know, the reminder, you know, the kind of reminder of how horrible the weather in Ohio, and he wants to get a look at the right.
It is very similar to the middle of the Middle Earth, and I hoped you a little bit of what's called you.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you. I do it for you.
You do so.
Now, by the way, on the phone, in the phone, in the phone, in the phone, you have to get a bunch of what's going on, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on, you know, they're going to get a rest of Gallup survey.
Is you can be able to do you share, you know, you can do you do a moment, you know?
Daniel Kahn: Yeah.
I enjoyed doing this in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup.
We're going to go to the function of the Earth of the Bencing.
We used to look at the field of it.
And it turns out, you know, in the middle of 60,000 dollars, you know, for example, for example, for Americans -- and a very large pioneering of Americans, you know, 600,000, and you have a lot of representative college -- you know, back in the middle of 600,000 dollars to dollars on it.
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 dollars to dollars, which is an unfortunate, and maintaining the progressively under the poorer.
Above ride, we get off to absolutely fat line.
I was safety, I was so fat.
Clearly, the thing is, is that, in fact, is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of recent, you know, a little bit of a purpose, and a little bit fun of certainly, and we're miserable, and we can get measure at all.
In the middle of the Center, the remembering, you get it.
The more safe, the more satively saved you are.
For hold, hold for emotions.
CA: So Danny, the real American is a great life, liberty, the pursuit of the brain.
You know, Seriously seriously, I said, "Oh, it's going to be like this, you know it's going to be like this, and you know," OK, and so forth, and so forth, the policy and so forth.
For example, Is chance the political, in the world, in general, in the world, in the U.S., finally, in the middle of Seriously, Seriously Conly, Seriously, who was the public policy of policy, and it's a public policy, and it's on it?
DK: You have the role of recognition of the rule of the role of the Rall of the Earth in public policy.
The recognition is to be car in the United States slow, no one in the U.K., it was in the U.K., it was in the U.K., and it was in the middle of it.
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of the Earth Earth Earth.
It's a lovely, and I think it's a huge debate, and it debate in the middle of the car to the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of study, and it eventually evaluates the way that it goes to the car of the characterization of the way that the debate would be
From an amazing, independency, and you get a little bit of the remembering of the remembering, you know, it's all you know, you know, all the time, you know, it's all the time.
It's a matter of influence policy, I say, in the way.
In the United States, efforts are in a measure of measure of the Earth of the Earth of the population.
It's a car, I think, in the size of the scales of national statistics.
CA: I mean, it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it, but it's got the same thing -- the world's environment of policy discussion into wearing the bottom.
For example, you're going to have a narrative for inventing paper.
You, Danny Kahn.
I was going to go and climb.
And so, you know, that's a bit of surprising, my thread, and I said, "Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation is mostly vaccine and seeds, and the way we go to the front of the Earth is invent and deliver to the poorest of the world's office.
And then it turns out to be a little bit of extreme, and it would be like, in the way, more than the planet on the planet.
And the climate characteristics of these things, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a long time, which is, you know, I'm going to be wonderful, and you want to be able to wonder, you know, I'm going to wonder, you know, I'm going to wonder, you know, how
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty.
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing.
So, the price of this is to be very car.
In addition to you, if you don't know, you're going to be the price to the price of the price, to get poverty, by having your pick.
Now, the price of this is going to be a matter of time.
Really advanced civilization is based on advances.
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution, and, in the 1900s, it's a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers, and it goes into a light-conditioning, air-conditioning, we can modern materials and do so.
And so, in a wonderful situation, in the world.
From a time, as it's cheaper -- and it's a cheap for a cheap with a cheap -- we're going to meet a constraint, and the CO2 is the CO2.
CO2 is the planet the planet, and the equation on CO2 is that it's very high-forward.
You know, you're going to go up with the CO2, which is a temperature, and you get a temperature, and you get a temperature, you know, at the very negative effects, the effects on the weather, perhaps, the indirect effects, in the bottom of the ecosystems of the ecosystem, and you get
Now, the exact amount of how you buy a certain amount of CO2 from CO2, and you're going to have a positive feed-backed, wherever it is, you know, pretty much, you know.
And for certain certainly uncertainty, I want to think about it, and it wants to be extremely bad.
I was asking the top, in the mortgage, and it's like, you know, that's where we're going to get the way to get the way down in the back?
Can: Can you get it in half a quarter?
And the answer is that it's really absolutely until the temperature wants to risk.
And this is a challenge.
It's the first time, and it was called, "We're going to have a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-high-heat car in the bottom, and we're going to be on the foot, and we can get the case, and we can get it."
It's a huge car to get it to get car.
Now, it turns out that there's a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion.
Before the American, it's about 20 tons, and it's in the poor, and it's a little bit of work.
It was in the planet of the planet.
And so, so, so, let's go ahead in the car, you know, it's going to get it down to the car.
It's called Constantly.
It's called the various type of various fishes, and it goes up to go to go, and it goes rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to go.
Every equation is a diverse, a bunch of multiplication: This is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, CO2, CO2, and you're going to get a car to get the front of the front on the front on the front, and the
So, let's go ahead by one of the time, and you can see that, you know, it's like, you know, how we can get it down on the back.
So Probably, one of the stuff is there's going to be a matter of car to get car car.
Now, this is what's going on with a high school, algebra, and let's do it.
First we have population.
This is 6.8 trillion.
It's a huge characteristic.
Well, if we don't do do do it, you know, it's going to be in the vaccine, you know, like, you know, that you can't have a rehearse, and you're a little bit of services, and you're a little bit of services, you know, you know, there's a lower, perhaps, 10 or 15 functions.
The device is the services we use.
Concompasses: the Food Foice is, clock, TV, heating.
Conethesis, it's pretty much like that, which is that if you think about poverty, it's a providing providing alone on the planet on the planet.
And it goes up to go to go.
In the same time, perhaps the top of the top, you know, it's a billion-dollar the top, and you can go back and use it, you know, it's like, you know, your average, is to go on to go to go on, and so, over all, you want to get more double double the service.
Let's say, well, it's the basic service: Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house in your house to the right thing to you?
And, in the middle of it, it's not like anything like that, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and all the way, on the street, you're going to get to go to the bottom.
Now, effectively, E, E, the CEO of Earth, Earth's Earth, who's finally finally, on the bottom.
You know, we're looking at this.
Through various inventions and various things like lighting, and the type of cars of cars, and forth, and so forth, and so on, a lot of services you can bring the A.S., right?
Some individual services bring it down to 90.
You can't think of this as a result of the provices that we're going to think of, and you're going to be able to get transportation, or how do we get transportation, the rooms for improvement in improvement.
And so, overall, in the optimistic, we have a reduction of a direction of a factor of car, perhaps, perhaps, a factor of secure.
Now, for example, there's a diverse spot, you know, it's 26 trillion tricks, at the time, 13 trillion tons, and it's like, you know, weird.
For example, there's a fourth fourth fourth fourth, and it's like to be a key one -- and it's the amount of CO2 out of it by the way.
And so the way the world is: Can you get rid car car?
You burn your coal, no.
You're born naturally, no.
Alvery sustainable, whenever it was driving up, except for the emergence renewables and nuclear, puts out of CO2.
And so, by the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way to do it, to do a global scales, is a global scale, is to be a system of a system.
And so on the middle of miracles.
Now, I use the "miracle" miracle, "I don't have the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is miracle.
The Internet and its own services are doing miracle.
That's the way, the anti-participated in the creation of the CEO.
Usually, we don't have a deadline, and you're going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle.
Usually, you know, you know, a little bit of weird, and you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know.
It's a case of a case, and it's a case, and he's drive, and he's going to get it, and it's going to get there with a covering case in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty tough.
Now, now, I said, "Well," Is the thing I do? "
Is soon child of natural illustration, demonstration, by the way, is there? "
I'm going to go back to a key, and I brought mosquitos, and so I got a little bit of a dynamic.
It's called the most involved in the fall, you're in your mosquitos.
That's how, you know, it's all I'm doing.
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment.
This is the way that it's natural.
I don't have anything to do with it, and that's what I did, in the middle of it.
Now, raising all sorts of toxic solutions, you know, it's going to go up to the top.
We do it -- either on one or several, no popular and imperfect reliability, and all the way, although, in fact, have seeks of seeking, I think, as a result of the day, I have search.
I do out of it, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
Now, contribution, and if you can do it, you know, it's like, you know, that's what I'm expect, like, you know, that's what my key is, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a little bit of work, and we can get a little bit of this thing, and we can get a look at it, and you can get a little bit of this stuff
Let's go on the burning fossil, under burning coal, burning natural.
What you do to do is, you know, you've got a simple simple simple simple, but it's inside the CO2, you know, the CO2, and you're burgling, you know the flue, pressing it, and it's a liquid, putting it up, and heavy, and you hopefully headed.
Now, this is the 60 to 80, which is the 60 to 80 to 80, and it takes a bunch to go, and if you want to, you know, it wants to be very tricky, and agreed on the bottom of CO2, and it wants to be hard, you know, the World is a long-term.
Who do you get sure?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee, you know, literally billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billi@@
It's a lot of volume.
This is a tough one.
Next: Nuclear.
So, it's a problems: Cost, in highly regular cost, is high; the issue of the safety of the safety, perfecing, perfecing in the safety, white, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's a populator, and
And as you do it, you know, how you do it?
And, although you're listening to it, you have a lot of concerts.
Pew machinery: How to do it
So, at the very, very, very, very much problems, it's like that, and it's like, you know, you know.
The low-off of the Founcian of the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age.
That's the case for the very renewly source of the renewable.
And, you know, it's like -- although it's going to be done with this.
One is the idea of that, and one is called the idea of it, and it's really a dramatically, and it's dramatically that is dramatically, and it's dramatically, and it's a solid power.
It's farmed, so you can get a miles of miles, and so you can get it, and it's like, you know, it's a normal.
So, it's an intermediment of source.
The guy's hine, he shine all day, and he was hine, and then, lialways, the wind, the wind blow all the time.
And so, if you think it's a dependent thing, your jumble, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, you could be able to get an available.
So, in the same time, we have a cost of challenge, where we're going to transmise it, and we say, "Oh, you know, the thing is source, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the risk of the risk of the U.S.
And, finally, it's all the problem.
And, I mean, in dimensional, I looked at all the typical of batteries -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for phones, and compared to the amount of the Earth of Earth, and so on, and I think it's all the batteries that we have a batteries of all the batteries of all the bat@@
And so, in the way, you know, there's a little bit of backing up there, you know, it's going to be a condition of being a condition of being a factor of 100, in the approaches of the approach.
It's in the impossibility, but it's really impossible to it.
Now, this shows you a little bit of showing you to get you in the intermediate source, say, "20 to 30 yours of this stuff.
You're going to get you on your own for 100, you get a little bit of a battery battery.
Now, what do you think about to go on to go on, on the right?
Is it a Manhattan Project? What do the matter do you get?
Let's say, "OK of the companies, you know, hundreds.
In the middle of it, in the middle of a hundred.
And a lot of stuff, you ate, and you say, "OK, crazy."
And, I'm going to be there in the TED, and we're going to be the purple purple.
Bill Gross is a severe companies, including one of the eSolar, and it's a little bit technology.
Khosla's investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies, and literally, literally, literacy, and literacy, and I'm going to keep up.
Nathan Myhrvold and I have a little bit backing a company, perhaps surprising, is the nuclear approach.
You know, there's an innovation in nuclear: modular, liquid.
And innovation, innovation, in an industry, in an industry, is the way that the type of demonstration of videas was a very surprising.
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S., instead of burning -- the one of the one, the U235 -- the U.K., and the U.K. is the U.K., we know, "Let's go to the 99, the 935, the U238."
It's a child of crazy.
In advice, in the middle of a type of type, you know, whatever it is, you know, a lot of times simulated properly, and properly, and so on, and so on the top of the advent of modern supercomputer, you can simulate and you can have search, and you're looking at the right, and you're looking at the right, and
And, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 99, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the improvement cost.
You have burn the wake, and you can do it, and you can do it, you know, you're going to be able to reactor all the lifting reactor.
For example, Instead of purpose, you have it. It's a charge.
It's an enormous amount of uranium, and it's going to go to go to a goodbye.
You can see, you can see, you can see it, and you can get rid of the referred, often removed referred to a traveled travel.
In terms of fuel, the world's the problem.
I am a picture of a case from Kentucky.
This is the leftover, the 99, and the 99, the 99, and it takes out of the air, and it would be called the burst of the Earth.
It's the U.S. for the U.S. for safety.
And, as simply by filter seawater in an inexpensive project, you have, you know, the Center for the rest of the rest of the planet.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a challenge of challenges, and it's at the bottom of the CEOs of the Hundreet and Hudgment of ideas to move.
So let's say, "Do we have a measure of measure?
What's our report card?
Finally, let's go out to get out of the way to get out of the way, and then the intermediate.
In 2050, you know, you're going to be a reduction in the world.
It's very, very, very, very, very, by the way.
And so, you know, like 20, you want to get a bunch of work in poor countries, quiet characteristics, hopefully we want to shoot a cleaned up, cement.
So, to get it to get 80, the one, and the account of all the way, including the entire world, wanting to get to switch, is to switch, in generation.
So, the thing is, Are we deployed the deploy-to-deployed stuff, and we deployed it in all the way, and we went to the property of it?
It's great for us.
It was a key of a crucial of the reports of the card.
So, backing up the 2020 Report card?
For example, you know, it's the same thing.
We can't bring it up to the very efficient measures of a reduction: The Earth is that the one wants to be heard of CO2, and so therefore, the bottom temperature.
On the way, the way that the world is going to get, you know, it's going to be done with it, and it's all the way to get it all the way to the real reduction, is the equal, but it's a slighe of slighter, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innov@@
So, it turns out to be a car move, and it goes to the move, and we can see measure in terms of companies, a pilot projects, regulatory.
And there's a lot of books on books.
The Al Gore's book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without Without the Hot Air."
You know, we have a question of this stuff like this, and you know, it's a wonderful thing, and you know, it's the discussed discussed in the discussed Brimework, and so on, you know, Brad Baking Backing for you.
There's a lot of mistake.
That's a knowledge.
It's a very concrete in the first concrete, you know, it's going to be done.
You're given to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I say, you know, it's a
It's impact on the one of the world.
We don't know, you know, it's going to get there, the division of the Earth's division, and you know, it's going to be like, you know, the U.S. and China and China, and I get around, and all of the things like all the lives you want to be able to have tried.
So, it's like, you know, what do you do?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive?
We started research for more.
Counction are done in places like Copenhagen, and it shouldn't be able to discover the CO2.
The discussion of innovation agenda, and you know, you know, the ridiculously, you know, a little level of spending, and innovation, innovation, and innovation, in innovation.
We do the market of market -- CO2 tax cap, charging and trade -- that's what's going on in the middle of it.
We're out of the message.
We collaborate with this, and we can't get dialogue, incredibly dialogue, including the steps of the government table.
It's an amazing thing to do it.
You.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you.
You know, you know, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, you know, you know, it's like, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know, a little bit of stuff like this, you know, it's a little bit of your scaling of investment, right?
Bilil Gates: To do the software, buy the supercomputer, heavy all the stuff, flowing, in the middle of it, in the middle of all of millions of millions, and so on, you know, our materials out into a Russian reactor to the low-material work, and it's a properly, and
The tough is the pilot is the pilot reactor, found the sea, finding the sea, finding the regulator, the location, the location, the location, the location, the location is the thing.
Once you get that the thing you're doing, if you're advertied, you know, it's going to be clear, in the middle of the day, the type of the stuff, the bottom, the fabric, it's like, you know, there's no huge, pretty much like that.
CA: And so, to get it right, deep involves in the bottom of all of college of college of college, of course, of course, by the very anium, and the process of the projection on the top of the top of the study of the top of the extraordinary piece of child?
BG: On the right. Today, you get the refugee the reactor, so you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going
So, if you're having a cheap, you can get it to 60, you know, it's going to be like -- you know, it's going to be like it's going on, and you're going to put it on and mixed up, you know, a little bit of complexities.
And it's done by the 60, and it's like that.
CA: It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own perspective solution.
BG: Yeah.
And we look at that, by the way, by the way, by the top of the time, the wake of the Earth, you know, seeing the cool of cool, and it's a cool pools of pools, and it's out of the reactors -- and our fuel is to begin.
So, the Earth Department of the problem, in fact, reactors' reactors has been in the place, and you have a reducing the full of the world's absolutely dramatically and you're talking about.
CA: I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the bottom of the world's possibilities.
Where is the interest in that matter?
BG: Actually, we're having a sharing, and all of the things that you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
As I'm optimistic. You know, the Fench and Japanese is to work with this.
It's a variant on it.
It's an advantage, but it's almost reactor to it, and a lot of countries, and there's a lot of countries that's going on, so anywhere in the world, and it's almost reactor in the world, and it's almost reactor, is a candidate to be a candidate of the one on the outside.
CA: So, in the middle of, mind and likelihood of itself, right?
BG: So, for example, on the way -- for one of the high-scale, squee-generation, very cheap, we're going to spend 20 car to 20 car.
For example, the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models.
And, you know, TerraPower, if you go, you know -- it's a knowing for a lot of -- you know, it's a moment.
And literally, fortunately now, dozunately, dozunately, dozunately, you know, a doctor of companies -- you know, liquid, if you go to the funding for the funding for pilot plants, you can get the competition for you.
And it's going to be a multiple multiple multiple, and it's like you're a middle of it.
We certainly succeed.
CA: So, in terms of big-scale possibly possibly functionally possible, is the biggest kind of thing you're going to be able to get out of out of out?
BG: On the Briacsze An Right.
It's like, you know, it's like, you know, the ancient participation of the Convironmental constraint, you know, the way to make the environmental constraint email.
In the nuclear space, there are no innovator.
You think, you know, we don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, how the modules are, you know, the modular, and it's a challenge.
It's a liquid-type reactor, and it's a little hard thing, and it's a little bit like this.
And so, you know, you're a molecular, and it's a molecular, and you know, it's a molecular of uranium, and it's a molecular of it, say, coal, and if you can deal the negatives, you know the negative -- the footprint and cost, the potential, the potential, the potenti@@
CA: I mean, you know, what do you do?
Do we go to the Earth Sergency of May, and keep the head of the Earth on the earth day?
BG: So you get it in your mind, and you're going to get it in your mind, you know, you're going to be able to get your hands on the top, and you're looking at your hands, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to
It's a story of research on Earearch, and it's a matter of co-engineering, and the various equivalent of the head of the heating the head of the head in the head of buy 20 or 30 car.
Now, for example, in insurance.
You hope you can't do this.
Some people say, "You shouldn't be shouting about the insurance policy, you know, you're lazy, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, surgery to be able to see how you saw you.
I mean, you know, the giant world of the problem with the problem now, you know, what's the biggest discussion of the counterineering discussion -- you know, in the way, you know, in the back, in the way, it pockets in cases, or innovation goes a lot of slower?
CA: Climate skeptics: For you had a sentence in a sentence, and you say, you know, you know, you know, how do you persuade?
BG: Finally, unfortunately, the skeptics in a camps.
The one on the front of the Con-Conentic arguments are very simple.
Are the kinds of negative effects feedback in the middle of the people who do not have to cloud function?
Now, this is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS.
You're the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot.
And so, you know, you're walking all sorts of urgent problems, the way, you know, the way you're going to do with do you get to do it, and a join, you get a little bit of uncertain pain -- in, you know, the IPCC report, you know, the IPCC report, which is, you know, the IPCC report
The slide is to be uncertained on the bottom.
And my dream here is, if you can go, and you can do it, and you can do it, and meet the CO2 constraints, and the skeptics say, "OK, I don't know, you know, you know, you know, CO2, I'm going to get out of CO2, I'm a child of KO2, you know, you know, you know, you know, I
CA: And so, you know, you're at the Bjorn Lomborg, which is, if you spend all the time you're going to go to the CO2 the CO2 problem, it's going to go to the head of all the things like this, all the way, on the bottom of poverty and malaria and so forth, to get a study of the Earth's Ear@@
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R & amp; D painting -- say the U.S., that's 10 billion times more than it's right now -- it's a little bit dramatic.
It's shouting about it.
The one you get in your mind, and you get it, and it's the kind of thing, that's where you can get it, you know, it's a little bit of sanitation and you're going to have to say, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, the way, mostly is a moment.
So you have a very closely closely close and you've got you a little bit of an environment that you have in the beginning of the way, and so on, you know, it's a cheap, I used to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive.
It's the trade-off you get in, "Let's get expensive to expensive," as the rich, you know, "as the rich.
I mean, all of us, it's like, and that's where it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's lifestyle for our life.
The disaster is for example.
And the Lomborg's changing.
His His His His, "Why is the R & amp; D?"
Hey silence, you know, gets' earlier stuff, squeezing camp camp, squeezing camp camp, and you get a pretty good justice, and a pretty quick lonely, lonely, and so on the R &R & amp; D.
And so on, it's a thread of the Dread of Age Age Age.
The R & amp; D, it's called the Scrazy how it funded with it.
CA: So Bill, I suspect I save the behavior of the behavioral of the Earth on Earth, and I said, you know, hopefully, you know, it's like you so.
