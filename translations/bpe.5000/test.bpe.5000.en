Several: Second, Several, last of the time, you know, Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow.
And the other way, teams of the Sallest, teams of the Sallest to the Tallest of the Tallest of 20 sticking, from 20 sticks of Saghetti, the yary of tape, one of the sting of tape, one of the ring of the string and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has a lot on top of the top.
And, for example, it's easy enough, it's the way that we use it to make a look at it, you know, it looks like that, you know, you know, it's all about it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it
And so I'm going to talk about what's going on, and I'm an incorporated it into a design design.
And it's something like that.
And, you know, I'm conducted to create 70 design design design, and I'm conducted to design, and designer, on the other way, the CTOs of the progress 50, and the CTOs of the Progress of the progress is launching the CTOs of the Progress, and it's the same way that I'm going to be able to do it, and I'm going to talk about it,
So, normally, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it
It's all like that, and it's all like that, and it's all about this, and it's all about it, you know, it's all about it, you know, it's all about it, you know, it's all about it, you know, it's all about it, you know, you know, you know, it's all about it, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a little bit like this.
We can do that, you know, it's an ancient planning, and it's all like that, and it's done, and it's done, and it's done, and it's done, and it's done, and it's all like that, and it's done, and it's all like that.
It's the other way that you have to do the exercise of this, you know, it's the other way that you're going to have the exercise of this, you know, it's the other way that you're going to do the style of the style of the sticks to the sticks.
And it's the way that you can do that, and it's all the way out of it, and it's all the way out of the marshmallow, and thoroughly, and thoroughly, and thanks to that, and you know, and you know, that's the way back, and that, you know, that's the way, and then, you know, that's where I'm going to be, and -- ta-da!
From the other hand, core of the smooth, is on the other side of the "ta-da" button into "uh-oh," the white side of the marshmallow is the other way to check and tags.
And so, you know, so, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
It's a lot of cheap, a lot of cheap, and that's how you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And of course, of course, you know, of course, you know, of course, you know, of course, you know, of course, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And it's like that.
As a dot of Peter, there's a Peter.
And so, you know, the way you're going to be like this, you know? Right? What? What's it?
And Peter likes to say, "Nice of the Secretary of the CEO of Spaghetti, Inc."
All right, don't have an intent power of power.
That's what's going on.
And the right side of the ice is used to meet the phone, right?
And that's why it's about it.
And that's where you have to be the marshmallow on the top of the top, right?
It's a crisis.
Sound familiar?
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
So, designers, you know, this is the essence of the design of the iterative.
And of course, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So the way to play the way to play in records in prototype, it's essentially an essential, which is, until it's, you know, it's the way that you've got to do.
That's the way that the right thing is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Who?
Architectivity, thanky.
Thirty-nine inch is the Tallest May.
And so it's it? It's the driver of it?
So CEOs, a stick of it, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be done.
So you put you put back on an executive address on the credit on the team, and they're going to be released.
You can do it. You're going to be done, you're going to go, you go, you're going to go, "Oh, we've got a team of people to win."
You can be used to do it. And ice?
It's a huge amount of skills.
It's managing the one, you know.
And there's a couple of credits to work and play a couple of pay to work to work with work, and it's going to be working on the creation of the team of power.
Specializing skills and facilitate skills are combining the combination.
And you can see 10 teams of these things, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to make you, you know, you're going to do that, you know, you're going to get off, you know, you're going to get you.
And I'm doing.
I mean, let's make you up to the end.
So I offered a 10,500 prize of software to the winning team.
And so, how do you do to do that?
What the right?
Narrator: Developing a team had a long time.
It had had had had a long time, say, a lot of it, you know, a one-to-one, and that's the prize.
Anyway?
We are the exercise of the exercise.
What do you do?
This is what's called the Big's prototyping.
The lower team of the room was the very worldwide.
It's the tallest of the tallest, and it's the dallest.
It's the way that we use this for us, and this is what's going on.
So, you know, you know, do you look at that, you know, a marshmalype?
And the one of the time, I'm going to take a look at the end of this, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And the marshmallow, you know, the marshmallow of it, it's going to be the way to do that, you know, you can see it.
You know, Frankly, you know, boom a lot of marshmallow, is it?
And the way of that, the way of that, a man named, a really, a lot of a sudden, a so-prototype.
And so, it's the other side of the one, which is kind of simple exercise.
And you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to go to Marshmallow Challenge.com.
It's just a blog that you can get to the marshmallows.
It's a lot of things to do that.
There are weird of crazy to the exercise of the exercise of the exercise of the exercise of the exercise of Sweak and added the system.
Recently records to records to say, "Oh," unfortunately, is good.
And the fundamental one, I said, is, you know, you know, this is what design is, you know, design is a sport.
It's all the way that we have all of our senses of our senses to the target, and we have to go to the end of the day we have to be at the end, and we're going to get to the very end of our anniversary, our edge, to the top of our sun.
And it's a prototype of this, and it's all like this, and it's all like this, and it's called "uh-oh," moment to a moment.
And that's how we can do it.
You've got a lot.
You know, it's right now right now.
A squiry, a cool, TED's round, and it makes it a tough.
And right now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can get to it.
And you can go to go to you, you can go on your go, and you can tell you that you're your name.
And I'm what you're doing for you, and I'm going to talk to you and I'm going to talk to my back, and I'm going to talk to my day, and I'm going to talk to my day, and I'm going to talk to my day, and I'm going to talk to my day, and I'm going to go back to my day, and I'm going to go back to my day.
I don't know. It's like to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go back to the Switter of Switter or Twitter or American Idol.
I don't.
I'm an apprecious, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And I do.
I'm an announcement of my Council, I'm going to say to say to say.
I don't have to go to go to go to go to go back, and it's going to be an ancient I's going to do it.
It's all sorts of things like that, it's all sorts of things like that, it's going to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, don't, you know, you know, you know, it's going to go back, you know, it's going to go back.
So I'm going to get to the right to get to the right, and I'm going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go.
This is the greatest two-the-the-the-the-the-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Centatest, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, Cancith, you know, wealth, aualth, mobility, accountability, accountability of it.
It's an enormous amount.
My great-and-the-shelter, all of them, by the bottom of the target, you know.
My favorite pushed was about to 70.
My name is on 80.
So, this is how a man got to the front of my life.
It's almost like that, and it's an ancient way to do it.
A, in New Delhi, we can be expect to live in live to live in the city of 100.
Think about it, it's coming up.
And that's it?
Smallpox. Smallpox's cheap of phone.
It resembled the demographic of the globe in a way, no way was no.
It's all about it. It's called it. It's called it.
We vanquished it. Puff.
So, in the side of the time, it's an unfortunate, and it's a generous way to be generated by a general day of the day.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio...
Are we going to talk about that?
Vaccines, modern, our day-to-foot, we have an enormous exercise of the disease.
And to my honest, the stick method -- it's all like it, if it's about it, it would be, you know, it's all about it, you know, it's all about it.
That's the way.
Below, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And of course, of course, this is the foundation of all of our accountability, a mighto dogo to hungry.
It's a scary of it, and it's all about it, and it's weird, and it's an ungraceful.
And so, we'll be able to make our imagination to throw our imagination to thoroughly trash.
Potable water, arable land, rainforest, rainforests, licks, gas.
Here's the way: do we do it? And I can do it.
I'm going to do it that we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
So, I'm able to do power to make power of power.
I'm doing it, and no, it's an ain, you know.
And you know, you know, you know, you've got to go to the picture of the day, you know, that's the way that we've got to talk about it at night -- we're going to talk about it, and we're going to talk about it right now, we're going to talk about it right now. Never.
And so, in fact, in a way, can be, in a way, in a way, in a way, in a way, in a way, in a flight, to be properly properly in the way that we can do.
We're right on the vertical of it, and we evaluated to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go back, 300, to the Enlightenment, to Vera, to be a two-and-up call, and we're going to take a look at an enormous amount of alg@@
You know, you know, looking at it, and you can see it, and you can do it, and you can do it, and you can do it, and you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it.
You know, on your own, you know, a set of it.
And, the list, in the list, to the other day, to the Oopinion, which is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's
How do you give you the other day?
You're not dying to your own face. Sorry.
And it's an awful lot.
About a capacial, ago, I have a story of Secretary of New Yorker. A video.
And I'm a judder to show up: opposition to ice, all of you, the credit, the credit, the credit, the style of it.
I'm an ancient to do, to do, to do, to do, to do, to do it, like I am, I'm going to talk to you, like I'm going to talk to you, I'm going to say, I've got a story and I'm going to talk.
And all of the time, I'm doing a story of genetic foods.
Same, you know.
Again, heavy, crazy.
So, a story of what I'm doing, and I have to say, "Frankenfoot," you know, you know, "Frankenods," you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Again, you know, I do you, I do, I'm doing it. I'm a story of the story, I'm going to talk about it.
I'm a journalist.
We're like, we're going to go, we go to dinner. It's fine.
It's an unbothered thing, and I'm going to go out of it out of it, and I'm not going to say.
And of course, as well as an erupy, it's a two-like tough, great driving of crazy, it's an enormous amount of crazy.
It's a tough thoughtful, it's a two-thoughtful.
Again, heavy math.
And that's what I'm doing.
Three, you know, you guys are honoring honest.
We said, we said, we said, in a way, we said, in a way, we said, in a way, we're not going to have a look at a moment, we know, right now, we're not going to go to the end of a slowly, we're not going to go to the end of a slow of progress.
We're doing it ambivalence.
We're doing it in Ionic, and we're doing it, "progress."
Okay, so, you know, it's right now for you, and I'm going to talk about it.
We are shrinking in an institution in an institution in authorities, and we're going to do it in a way, and we don't know what we're doing.
You can be used to say, "You know," a name of the name. "
Chernobyl, Bortal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass dead, sacrifice.
You can be able to get chose.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, we're going to
Ask, demand, demand, demand.
Don't be granted for you.
So, you know, you're getting profound, you know, you know, you get to the proof, you're going to be on account, and we've got to do it.
And the Momenh I can say, "This is" the "is" we're going to be doing this "is" I'm going to be "unfortunately" is now in the epidemic of the A.D.
About 12 of them, something a story of publish published, a horrible story, straight the epidemic of autism to the guy, mumps and rubella vaccine.
Very scary.
Tay of my students are difficult to see the tatest to see the difference.
So in the end of this day, it's a big serious student.
That's what we are doing.
The Ages of the United States, the U.K., the England, the U.England, the Sweden, the Canada, and it all of the dead: no correlation, no one, none of it.
It's all about it. It's the way that it's done, it's an unfortunate way, we're going to look at it, we're going to look at sea, we're going to look at sea, we're going to go over, we're going to look at sea, we're going to see it.
We don't have a GDA Bunch of the people that we're doing, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
You know?
The introduction of this was a disastrous.
Disastrous, you know, the U.K., the U.U. is, the U.K. is of the Sun, the U.K., the vacciny, you know, right now.
It's an disgraceful, and we're in the middle of it, and we're in the middle of it.
It's called horrible.
What was the kid of a shelter?
Now I'm doing it. I do it.
Okay, so, you know?
Has one person in the dead end of it?
Does very much.
Does up there, he said, "Don't get 160,000 in the emergency."
Again, a lot of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 20.
It's all like this, we can do it, we can make it out of it out of our minds, and there's Jenny McCarthy's go, and he's a dental of Benny McCarthy, and he's got to go to the Bennil of Oprah, and "Larry King Live."
And he can do it in the left of the left of your left and correlation.
It's not that you don't have to do that, right?
And it's going to be like this, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it for it.
It's what's called, Jonas Salk.
Hey, funny of the most crucious of managing, you know.
No one, no one.
It's in the other way.
His name is Paul Offit.
Hey, this is an rotvirus vaccine, a lot of a broad.
It's about 400 to 500,000.
Preer, right?
It's because it's an extension, it's an extension, it's an extension, it's an extension of Paul, and it's about to be used to use it, you know, you know, you know, it's valuable and it's valuable to do that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And he's going to do it.
So Paul's a terrorist.
In fact, Paul Speaks, in a way, he can scan be save-to-to-tech.
Hey, she's got a guy named him to him, and he's got him for him, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he
And right? Give Paul is a vaccine.
I don't say to say to say to say, "Go," you know, I'm going to say, "I'm going to say," I'm going to talk about vaccines.
You're running up, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the horrible dish. And you can see it.
We're going to take it up.
And it's what's going on, and it's all about it, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And it's not used to be used to the end of it.
What's polio?
A colleagues of mine, a college of mine, a college of mine.
No one's bodies.
She said, "Whereas, to vaccinate," she said, "Whereas," she said, "Day," no way.
Fine.
Anyway?
We are in a moment of polio in a way of policy.
Today, I don't, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, Legos, you know, you know, it's going to go to LAX, and he's going to go to LAX, right now, right now.
And he's going to land to land, and he's going to land in a yellow of a car, and he's going to rubber a car, and he's going to go to the car of Long Beach, and he's going to attempt to something like this, and he's going to be an enormous TED dinner.
And it's going to be a paralytic, and it's a paralytic.
It's right on the road live. Don't preform it.
Now, we go to washing up in lies. We do it to do it.
This is what we're going to be like to do that?
Echinera, a leading anxidant to get you.
I'm going to give you a quick with you of what I did.
On the other hand, and we have an alternative, and it's an alternative, and it's going to be the same way that we've got out of it, and it's going to be done.
The intent it was all the time.
You can see that's more than that.
It's okay, it's okay for you 28?
I gradually you.
That's an urine.
Okay, so what we do?
Again, I'm like, you know, we have Big Pharma.
We did Big Government. We don't do you.
And we said, "Recured," you have to look at the same.
It's called "Kruel to the extent of it."
It's an astonishing cold and soul-down to talk about it.
So, how do we do this, and we're doing it?
We launch into the poor of Big Plabbo.
It's amazing. I'm a Big Placebo.
So, you know, it's just a serious serious way of doing that, you know, it's a serious way of doing that, you know, it's a bit of it, you know, it's crap, and we're able to use it on it.
And I do all sorts of things like this.
None of it -- they went on, fraud; echinera, fraud -- I don't know, you know, it's right now.
And you know? Don't, you know, I said, you know, I said, "What I'm saying," What do you do? "What do you do?
It's called it. "
Do you go? You're going to do it.
I don't have an opportunity to do it as if it's the former of HHS in HHS's disease, "Hmm, I'm used to talk to the other of my experts on mammograms," or, you know, you know, it's a good job to meet.
And you're going to go to the red of the road, and you're going to tell you, you know, you're going up to you, you know, you're not going to get to you.
You're up in Thabo Mauki South.
Hey, he was 400,000 of his Souby insisting insisting insisting, guarlic and left-head-property temporary is more effective than the antiretroaviral path we can slow slow of the creation of AIDS.
Hundor of the Cistory of Developy's Cannel, in a sweet, a punished, a punishment, a punishment, a punishment, a punishment, a punishment, a punishment, a punished, a punished package, as if you had a look.
Please, don't, you know, you don't have an idea of no consequence to no consequence.
It's right.
Now, the spirit epidemic we're in the middle of right now right now is the same absurd bite of genetic footage of the organic elite.
It's in idiotic debate. It's a bit to it.
It's a debate of that, it's a debate, it's metaphor.
It's an ideology, it's all about it.
Every: Svery: Svery, right, in grace, clearly of a rice, crude of Parsley, the home-and-up is going up.
You are, you know, there are sanloyers in the yellow of Eden.
There's a lot of anthrops. It's called Christmas. We do it all.
We do it over the load 11,000.
And he did it, and it's all of it.
We're talking about the other way.
Now we can do it in a more precise way, and we can do it in a very precise way, which is that we can do it, and we can do it in a flight vitamin A into rice, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it,
You don't do it to do you?
I'm saying to say, I don't know.
We're object to genetic foods.
How do we do?
So, you know, the Secretary of the Secretary of the II: Too, chemicicking, peat up, hormones, monoculture, we don't have any of the things that are curious about the length of the land.
We don't care about it.
We don't know what we're doing.
And you know my response to all of it?
You can get it right.
It's right, we have a season of food, right now.
There's a big deal to do.
It's all about this morality, it's patent.
You can do it. You can do it.
It's just a matter.
It's right on it; it's very much.
It's an ancient, and it's all about it, and it's all about it, and it's all about it, and it's all about it, and it's all about it, and it's all about it, and it's right now, you know, you know, the other way that we're doing it, and it's right now, you know, it's right now, you know, it's right now, you know, right now, you know
You know, in the 150 path, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 70, you know, 70
It's going to be investigating to be 30.
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.
It's about it, and we're still dying it up.
And right? Geneenty-based foods.
We don't call it to the end of it, and we went to the other side of it, and we had to do it as a result of it.
Cassava was helping a lot of it.
It's a little bit of a kid's kid.
It's a quick of computing. It's looking for it.
It's an unfortunate, it's proteins, it's service, and it's really, you know, you know, it's an unfortunate, and it's really, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's all right now.
And throwing up to be able to do that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and
Are you so strong, and you can do it?
It's the same time. It's a block of Chez Panisse.
And all I can say, "Come on," is, you know, do we claim it?
I'm like, let's start with this: You know, what's how we did it?
Are you not going to be used to this?
And it's very much like this. It's not that it's chemine.
It's not that it's our ridiculous passion for the hormones, our insistence on it, our insistence on food, or food, singular food.
Recently, Rice Krispies, and it's an alongy of that, and it's an eradicing, and it's an aquaculture, and it's an accurate, and it's got to make it happen to be used to do it.
Do you have it?
Don't, we don't, if we were to acting it up to the other way, we're going to acting the way we're doing, you know, you know, thankfully of the day I'm going to be, you know, you know, thanks to this way, you know, you know, thanks to this way, we're going to be a good job, right?
There's no one way to do that, no matter, no matter.
It's weird, it's a weird, it's called Fugly, it's about it, and we can do it.
So, this is the only way that we can tell you to say, "So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It's a foot in the phone right now, and I'm going to stop it.
We can do a set of tons of autonomy.
We can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we put it up to the day, we can do it.
We take a look at this thesis, we call it up to the day, and then we go to the switch, you know, we're going to go to the tough, and we get to the tide we're going to go to the tour, we're going to go, we're going to go to it.
I'm going to do it, and as a result of the day, I'm on, and as I said, I'm going to talk to the Cancer Cancer Cancer, I'm going to talk about it right now.
You.
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez, Steve Lopez Steve Lopez: Wow the forest of downtown Los Angeles.
And the phrase, which is a lot, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And I've got a story of you, which is Steve Acolumn's disease, and it's a book, which is a book, which is a book, which is a book, which is what you can do in a book, which is, like, "Oh," and Jamie, Jr. Acting, and Jamie Foxx Ayers, the Juilliard trajectory, the Juilliard trajec@@
Nathaniel threed out of Juilliard, he's going to say, he says, he's going to go down, and 30, he's going to go to the boat of the boom of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I'm going to close on all of you, to the point of Steve's book, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I killed Mr. Ayers in 2008, and it was the way that Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Hey, it had a performance of Beethoven's performance of Beethoven's first and Fourth symphonies, and then we're running backwards and introduced.
Hey, what punishes in a very common foot-and-foreign way, Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers are like the World Series, and all of the most unfortunate, the World Seriation, all the yield of the M.S. Passage in the load of Beethoven, Fourth Symphony.
And we're going to be like this, and I'm standing up with email, and I'm standing up with email, Steve a M.D.
Now, you know, I'm going to talk about the nation of nation of nation, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to make a look at what was treated for that, which is what he treated to be like to do that, and I'm going to talk to the Thorazine and Thorazine, and it's a deck of a strank for him.
Again, this is a lay-up, and he goes to the matheheneun phisodes, which is what you can see, in fact, of course, manifestes, and that's what he can do his load, and thoughtless, and that, on the birth of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, the footation of his own, unleashed upon him
And Nathaniel: What's going on in a campaign of agitation, we sit down to Walt Disney Concert Hall -- and he went to a kid of manic glasses, and he said, "What's going on."
And he's going to turn out what's called invisible demand and smoke, and how does what poisoning him in his houlder.
And I have an afraid, and I'm going to be what afraid I'm going to talk to you about, and I'm going to be able to get to you a lot of him, and I'm going to go to my anolin, and I'm going to be the flow of the fault, and I'm going to be the fourth of the fault, and I'm going to go to my nation, and I'm
This is how I do.
And I played on the side of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
And what I'm playing, I'm going to have multiple things of what a progression was like a progression of a project.
It's what's going to be if he's in the grip of an invisible pharmaceuticine pharmaceutical, a chemical realing, for the other hand of what it's catalyzing.
And Nathaniel is a manager of what translates translated into a lot, a quick curiosity.
And in a miracle, he's lifted up to be violin and he's coming up with the other, by ear, snippets of violin concertos to lay out -- fabula, Tchaikovsky, Siberia.
And we're going to be on this way, and we're going to be on this way up to Beethoven and Brahms, brown, all the B, you know, Bartók, all the way up to E-Pecca Salonen.
Now, I've been traveling to get to the University of Encyclopedia, and I've been traveling, and I'm going to be able to get related to this day.
Hey, thanks to the baby of passion, and I went to my colleague in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And of course, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it had a paranoid, you know, the parano@@
Music is actually. Music.
And for Nathaniel, it's sanity.
Again, allowed him to go to a thoughtful, and then you can do a imagination and his creativity, into something.
And, in fact, this is where it's an order-orded.
And I have multiple things of what the most essence of this is.
It's what the very sweet of the day, we know what the very smoke is all about, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, on the very fundamental core, our emotions, our emotions, and our nasty, our creativity, we're dying to the other emotions of emotions.
And the exercise of that, in fact, reaching all of us and moves, inspires and unit.
And for Nathaniel, it's a fold of it back into a fold of it.
The reductive power of his head back into a college of music back into a column of music to a couple of music, and he was a talent, and he's a talent.
And I want to say, I want to say, you know, I'm going to talk to you.
You.
Bruno Giussani: Are you. Thanks.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I'm going to be on the phone of play to play with you, and I'm going to be on the phone of that.
This is how you can make it.
I was Jane McGonigal. I'm designing a picture.
I'm going to talk to you right now for 10, and my goal for the recording is to try to do it as to try and make it a reality in real life, as it's in real life.
Now, you know, I'm doing a picture of it, and it's an argue of that, and it's an awful thing about it, and it's an argue, so it's an awful lot, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, all of you,
It's right now, and we're going to talk about it right now.
So, you know, you've got a lot of you to say, "Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Maza to be augmented, unfortunate, the way that we have concerned to be in the right.
So, according to my mind, according to my following the Institute of the Institute of the Future, the opposite of the institution.
Three of the other day, the other day, is the other way to talk to the other day.
In the way, I'm going to be there, I'm sure we're going to be like, you know, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be like, to be right now, we're going to be able to
I got calculated the total we did 21 players.
So, in fact, in a bit of a quick intuitive, like I said, "Oh," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said,
No. I'm going to be serious. I am.
There you go.
I'm going to be used to do it as well as I'm an essential to the O.C.
This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.
Hey, he says to be the emotion of the emotion of gaming, so smooth, a camera camera in the front of your gamers.
And it's a very classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you can tell you, you know, if you're right now, you know, you're missing yourself in your way, you're missing yourself.
You can be the one of the Secretary of angency, a sunny of it, highly concentrations, and you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
You're having a gamer, you know, you want to be a quick you want to be here: the crinkle of the spup, and the mouth is a sign of optimous, and the eyebrows is surprise.
It's a gamer, a gamer, a gamer.
Oh, you've got to do it.
OK, so, like, this is what we're going to do.
Now, in fact, in fact, this is an extra of an extincise, is so extra positive, you had no things to do that.
It's what's happening to the threshold of the threshold of imagination, and as you get to you, you know, you're going to get to the other of you, you know, you're going to talk to you, you know, you've got to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
It's an epic win.
It's a gamer on the verge of the right of the right of the epic win.
And what's happening is the face of the face of the face of the world on the board of the problem of the problem of the problem solving all of the things that we're doing right now, the other side of the day, the obstacle of the one -- the face of it -- the face of it, all of the odds, is on the bottom of the epic win.
Now, right now, unfortunately, is more of the face of the face, we're going to be sailed to savings on the face.
This is an M.D. 'I'm the "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm afraid Good."
It's like you see it. Are you seeking?
And this is the "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I'm going to talk about" I'm going to talk about "I don't know."
This is a cast of graffiti in my old line of graffic border in Berkeley, California, my PhD.
And it's a problem that is a problem with a problem with that.
We are unfortunately, and we're in many cases, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in a way, in fact, in a way, in fact, right now.
I don't know, I don't care about it.
We're doing right now, and we can do it.
So, I'm in motivated to do this in motivated to do things like that, and I'm an inspiring, and we're inspired to go to the lab and to cooperate.
And what we're doing is that I'm going to say, "I'm going to talk about," I'm going to say, "I'm going to talk about" The O.D. "I'm going to talk about it, you know, the Secretary of it -- the Secretary of the moment -- the Secretary of the moment, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And in real life, we're going to talk to your face, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, we're
We are preservating, we used to transfer them up, we have an anxious, depression, frustrated, frustrated cynical.
We have a look at what we're doing right now, we said, "We know," we don't know what we're doing. "
This is what I'm going to talk to you, and I'm a graduate student.
What is the impossible that we can do that we can use?
Are we going to be able to make sure that we can do, and what we're doing, is that we can do it?
So I said, Games's World of Warcraft, and it's the ideal of the ideal, the ideal, the ideal, the ideal, the ideal, the ideal, the ideal ideas of problems like that.
And I switch to you, and I'm going to go to one another day, and I'm going to talk about it right now.
The other day, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
There's an mission that's mission, and it's an abundance of a mission, and it's an abundant, and it's just a mixed thing that is mission, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, right now.
Okay? So you can do it.
You can tell you a lot of you.
So it's on the bottom of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
Again, no unreliloyment in World of Warcraft; no one, wringing, unfortunately -- to be able to do it.
So, you know, are the other day of the workplace.
You can go to your goal, and you're going to work with you, you know, you're going to work with you, you know, you're going to be able to make you, you know, you're going to work with you, you know.
Now, unfortunately, in real life, in real life, we're going to be able to go to our fingertips, and we've got our fingertips on our fingertips.
And what we're doing is, you know, we're doing a story of what we're doing, and we're going to talk about it, and we're going to talk about it, and we're going to get back all of us, and we're going to get all of us dough.
You're going to be used by leveling up, and one strength, + 1 intelligent.
We don't have to be used to make sure that we can do a moment of deprivate in real life.
I'm going to get to the end of my day, and I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I don't know how I'm going to get home.
Now, the problem with this problem, the problem of Warcraft online, the World of Warcraft, is that it's so satisfying to be used to be able to be dealing to be the exhibition of genic wages all the coridemic, we're traveling to all of you to do it all the way that we can do.
It's the other way that it is.
So, this way, in fact, in a way, a lot of the World of Warcraft gamers, 5,93 pages of Ashoth.
Now, unfortunately, there's an enormous amount.
It's the way it's doing it.
And to put it in context: 5,93 path of the day, what's going to be, our earliest primate is ancestors.
That's what the "upright primate."
So, as far as we go to this, you know, what we do is we have an indictation, and what we do is we have an intent investment, the way that we're doing it, the way it's, you know, the way it is, you know, the way it is, you know, the way it is, you know, the way it is, you know, the way it is, you know, you know, it's
So it's okay, it's all about it, and it's out of it out of it, and it's all about it, by spending all sorts of activity, we're going to be in charge of it right now.
We use to be an evolved to be a publish-up investigation and a lot of time.
Okay, so, right. I'm going to do it.
So, in fact, in the end of the day, it's a static store, it's what's going to be a published by a professor, Carnegie Mellon University, which is the other part of that, in fact, a quarter of the other, a guy in a quick, a guy, and the other person, in fact, he wants to take 10,000 people online.
Now, this is 10,000, a two-way to do.
Salth of all, to the United States, 10,080, is the exchange of the extent of it, you know, you want to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
So, you know, we went to the parallel of the parallel of the punishment of the unfortunately, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It's a cognitive cognitivity of cognitiveness that we can do, in fact, we can do master 10,000 people of effort to the age of 21, we want to be virtuous at it.
We want to be able to make it a little bit of the way we're in the greatest one.
And this is what we're doing, right now, in fact, is the general of the general of the world's general visual virtuoso.
So, the same way, the same way, "What do you have?"
It's if we go off, you know, we're going to be like this.
So, this is how we go to the day, and this is what we're doing right now in the middle of the day, and this is what we're doing right now in the middle of the day, and this is what we're doing right now.
Certainly, are our virtual virtuoso gamers, 500 of our virtual drops, are going to be extended.
And in the recycling, we're going to be used to the point of dying, and we've got to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
You don't know it for you to do it.
The Council of Cancer's Council's County are called low-up, and they work on the other way, and they work with the operating sky of the weal-and-broadband of broadband Internet, so that's the way you're going to be like this, right?
It's an unfortunate one more than that.
It wants to be on up to 1.5.
This is the way that I like to go to a lot of the way that I'm born.
You know, you know, it's an anxiety I'm going to get up.
OK, so it's an extreme motivation.
Imagine is to optimize the deal-to-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A@@
Gamers, Gamers, Mamers, and this is what we call it, and this is what we call it.
Gamers don't.
Gamor are virtual virtuosos at weaving.
So, a lot of things we're looking at here is, you know, a lot of things we're looking at here, we're going to take a look at it, and this is what we're going to be like, and we're going to play a little bit like this.
And the sky, it's almost like this, it's a crank of a seat to play.
We sit down to the other day, you know, we want to look at it, you know, we want to look at it, you know, it wants to be, you know, it wants to be, by the way, you want to play with the lower one, the load, the load, and the one of the time it is.
And so, again, there's a lot of people that are up to that up and cooperation.
And we're strongly stronger.
Blissful.
You can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It's what we're doing, we're going to do it, we're going to be like this, we're going to be like this, we're going to be, right?
We are in charge, and we're optimized to be optimized as a result, to do it, to do it, and we're doing it.
And gamers are willing to work to work, you work, if you're going to work on the right.
Finally: There's a matter.
Gamers: Gamers to be attached to an attage to awe-inflating abuse.
So, this is a bit of a trivia of trivial punishment in perspective: so, you all know Wikipedia, you know, all sorts of things.
Second enjoy in the way, sun 80,000 articles, is the World of Warcraft.
Five it up with this.
There's a lot of people on the World of Warcraft on the Internet, or any of the topic coherth of any of you in the other.
It's right now.
There are the World of Warcraft.
Okay, so most of this is an enormous amount of sold to be upset up to one of these: Gamers are super to individually individual than.
There are an awful lot of people who are in the middle of the day.
And the one problem is, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, there are, you know, the
This is the problem I'm going to talk about.
This is what happened is called Edward Castronova.
His work is brilliant.
Hey, it turned out to be used to be used as well as we did, and we're going to talk about it, and we're going to talk about it.
And he goes, "We're driving up," We're driving on no way to no one than a mass of virtual a virtual word and online. "
And it's going to be like that, that's how it's going to be.
And I'm going to go back to you, I'm going to design it, you know, I'm an awful lot of designer, I'm excited.
Again, it's going to be suspended, and it can be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to the other day, and you can see it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in real life.
Again, even more stronger, as well as they can be in real life, they can be safe in real life, and it's an unfortunate amount of rewarding and more expecting in real life.
So, for now, for doing this, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, is that it's an unfortunate for gamers to be more comfortable in virtual worse than the real.
Now, I mean, I mean, I'm poor, it's rational, for now.
Indeed, by the way, by any of you, of course, to optimal situation.
We said to the right side of the real work more often.
I'm my inspiration of my inspiration, I'm going to inspire it 2,500.
Idean is ancient, you know, the ancient of the sheep.
Before, we had a phenomenon, we had had a sheep, you know.
And most of the things that corresponds to the prescripation of the day is, and if you're familiar with the family of the work of the ancient Greek, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're right now, you know, you're right now, you know, you know, you know, you're right now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's the
Herootus: Muku: Real-to-upper games, a poor inventation in the kingdom of Lydia, which is a dead of family.
Apparing, and what we did was that a lot of people at the end of Lydia had had a lot of work to do that, in fact, crazy.

And my other things, and my thoughts, over what's called this, what's called this, what we did was that we had the night.
So I interrupted him. I'm like, "Miguel, did it?
Hey, he looked at the algae.
"I am, you know, thanks, the algae, the photoplankton, the one, it's.
Are we going to have heard of it?
What is the fame?
It's going to be coming up to a lot, and it's coming up to you, and that's why I'm going to tell you, and that's where I'm going to do it, and that's where I'm going to do it, and that's where I'm going to do it, and I'm going to talk about this, and I'm going to talk about this, you know, this is where you're going to get to the savings of your own
The plan biomass, the photoplankton, the zooplankton, it soils the other.
The system is so bad, it's totally running off.
There's no fair.
Realing from a farm of a farm?
Later: Later Miguel, I mean, I know, what we're doing, you know, I said, "Well," a Service, I said, "Well," a Secretary, I said, "Come on, I'm going to say," Well, a Secretary, I said, "Well, a Secretary, I said," Sera, I said, "Sera,
And it's the moment that it's a film that was a film for a film.
And we've seen rounded the corner and the one of the pink, and it's a parallel pink, a paralley pink card for a period of you.
"Gauve up."
"Look at it a little bit, pink.
It's safe. "
Feaching? I'm just like that.
I'm like, "Miguel, you know, are it?
"Uh," it says.
"We're going to be 20 degrees of our authorities.
So, my load, liberty, it had 600,000 bulds on it, more than 250.
It's all about it, the largest and the largest of the world's private Bird sanctuaries in all of them. "
I'm like, "Miguel, Canuel, a thriving in the bird bird, are you going to load your load?"
Hey, hunny, no.
Hey, "We're coloring extensive, including intense.
This is an Iological.
"The flamingos' shrimp."
The shrimp of the photoplankton.
The pinker, the one, the one.
Okay, so let me review you, a farm, a farm, and a farm, and a farm, you know, it's a farm, and a farm of how you can do it, and a farm, you know, it's a coloring part of it.
So A is a column, and he was coloring a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, in the way, inflamingos, home-and-up appreciation is in the middle.
It's broad in a town in a town 150, the soils of the Soil, the Soil, the Soil, the Soils of the day.
Every, he's 150 of them in the farm.
And of course, it's 150.
Now, this is what we're doing right now, to follow the broken line of the highway of the highway of A92.
No.
I imagining a "March of the Penguin," which is, of course, Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, do you take 150 of them to the farm, and do you have 150?
Is it for you? "
Hey, he had had a Mitney Houston song.
Hey, he said, "No, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's right."
I'm doing the skin of my bin of my leova, which is what delightful -- and I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know it, I don't talk about it, I don't talk about it, I don't know it.
It's sad of acries, tar-wise.
I'm doing cook about it.
Yet, I would say it's a join in southern join, it's all about it, and it's all like that.
It sweet sweet and clean, it gives you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a great sharp of the one.
I went to Miguel, and I'm going to go.
Hey, he said, "The skin of skin.
It's the load of the load sheets of it.
It's an evolutionary to virtually, it's going to be done. "
And thirtens, throw, "saving your water a no imprecious."
OK. A colle-of-the-called hunchy, a farm, a farm, is a farm of how to do it.
And I'm going to go back to you, "A colle-dry," he's an impreadious, "he's going to go up with a couple of them, the water flew of the water.
It's a mark of a river, and it's a marriage, which is a separate way to carry up to carry to carry, chemical, chemical imidents, pesting de.
And of course, it's all the way it's all about the system of the system and the leaves, the water is cleaner than it.
The system is so bad, it puriated the water.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Walk water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.
A three-dimensional, A, I put it up, and as you do it, and so, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
You're asking it to be a recipe for the one of your graduate food, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
What we're doing now is a really radically, you know, it's a radically, you know, in the field of poor, right now in the middle of the food.
For a lot of things, you know, you know, it's a bit too radical.
We are announced, and we're really measuring us, and we're focused on it.
We are colorers' markets, we're going to be colliful, we're running down, we're currently running footage, we're running organic.
And you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, right now, you know, you know, you know, the yellow of your lifetime, you know, you know, the yellow of grade food, you know, it's
Do you have to be a fame to you?
Is I honest?
I don't know.
No, nearly, we have to be called calcular to more, more than fed to.
One of you wants to go to a go.
One of them -- it's more than denial, like, of course -- the big of the big in-Canalities in charge.
Now, you know, I don't know, I'm afraid of the lower of our food system for the poor.
Feed grain to heroculating, according to the age of monoculsion, chemicas to soil, chighting to them, and all of them, and all of them, a punishment, "is what we're going to be doing more, more than that, more than that, more than a quick game, which is to say," Oh, do you look like this? "
The motivation, it's the motivation of the justification: it's the cruel of the anxiety of American agriculture.
So we're putting it up to it, a column of liquidation, a two-and-the-art anesthe-based anestheological, in fact.
Again, there's a big deal, and it's an awkward.
And it's called bread-based, and it's an academic, which is, you know, you know, it's an acenished soup of diminishing souly, and you're dedicated by diminishing.
Encest to the latest combine combine and graduate debine, and you're going to pump by finding land, including by flying water, including by watching water, including by chainsavine, hirby by Canby, and there's a lot of fish, and a lot of a fishing boats and nice, that's going to be done by something.
Would to go to the right?
And then we started by asking by asking: Do we have to say, right?
Narrator: Could we be used to be used to be used to be used to feed?
AB: Well, don't you know, don't you know, don't have the Arik of the Aspan Age.
It's painting up to it. It's weird.
It's a little bit of performance, chemistry and doing it, and it's got to do it as a result of it.
Increte, we take it to the Eological.
And it's the other way to do that, it's an in-the-the-the-the-the-art job.
Look, look to Miguel, colorful miguel.
In fact, farms are saving to be unprecedented, collims of separate dead, collims, extended to farm extensively, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, to be colorers, but farmers who are poor.
It's an unfortunate expert on the ground.
And if I'm honored to be honest to be honored to be honest, I'm going to be honored to be honored to be honored to be honesty.
You know, you know, I'm okay, you know, I'm okay, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
You.
I'm up, up up on a steady, a steady of the day.
In high school, I was a bus bus to school, you know.
And I think of a book in a book, and it's a book called the book, and it's called my phone, and satisfying, in a narrative form, dominable by curiosity, I had.
And so you, in fact, a manifestity of manifest in the middle of the day of Senense I, in school, I'm in high school, which is out in the woods, hijing and snap and bugs and bound water -- and bringing it back, and it was the yellow of it.
You know, I'm like, I'm like.
It's all like that, you know, all of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the one, the one.
And my exercise of my favorite, I think, my friends of my talk, which is what I'm going to talk about, is something like that, something like that, something like that, what's going on, what's going on in the middle 6th, we have a two-way of the time, we're going to have a two-way exploring.
Jacques Cousteau, which is what we call to take in our late rooms, and as a result, we use it as a result, and that's what we call it to the other place that we can do.
So, this is the way to resist to resonate, to resonate, to resonate.
And I like that.
I'm going to draw. I'm going to put it.
And I'm going to make a living video of the video of CG movies and all of the CG movies of CG movies, and all of the things that I'm doing in the other landscape, I had to say to my own.
You can do all of you, as you go to a book, as you go to a book, and then you can see the author, you know, the author of the author, you know, on the other hand, you put it on the other side of the big screen.
And so, my response to what to do to do, to draw, to draw, to draw, to draw, to draw buildings, are worldwide, robots, safe, all of them.
I finished to be finished in math of math, and I'm finished.
That's what -- the creativity had had had had to go up with you.
And of course: The Jacques Cousteon shows up, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very familiar to what's going on in the world right now.
Now, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to go to a lot of a walk, and I'm going to go to a lot of time, and I'm going to go to a lot of time, and I'm going to go to a lot of a game, and I'm going to talk about it, and it's an unfortunate.
So, what's going on is, you know, on the other day of the day, right up, right on Earth, right on Earth, which is right on Earth, which is what a rich and exotic, as a result, I had an imaginary school, and I had an imaginary school.
So, I'm like, I know, I'm like, you know, I'm like to say, "Oh, to Ma Cuba, the age of 15."
And the one problem, which is what I'm going to do in a school in Canada, 600 pages the nearest.
This is what I'm doing.
I went to my announcement, and I'm going to take my chuba in Buffalo, New York, right on the border.
And I'm doing certio in a pool at a PMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I'm going to be the one, a real way, a real way, a real way, a real way, a real way, for you.
Hope, in the intervening 40, I have 3,00,000-foot pages of 3,000, and 500 of them in submersive.
And I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to go to the shelter, and it's the shame of the shame, and I'm going to have the shame of the shield, are the way that I'm going to do it, you know, it's the way that I'm going to do.
Nature to imagination is this bounding compared to our own campaign.
I'm still quick to date, and it was in absolute awe of the OD I, and I'm looking at it.
And my credit is on my credit, and it's an enormous.
So I'm going to be adverted to a lot of the day, and it's an enormous thing.
And I had to say to be the one way to be the one way to be the one way to call my anger to the day of my angles.
And I think that, as a result, a drama comic, and so on.
So, filming what the way of the way to put up and shut up.
And of course, of course, from the Service I chose to the heavy of my heavy, "Terminator," "Aliens," and "Aliens," and "The Abyss."
And it's called "The Abyss," "I'm going to talk to you about my creation of underneath a couple of water and diving.
So, you know, you were there, you know.
From the way of "The Abyss," which is what happens to Vera, which is a little bit of a great narrative issue on the other side of this, which is what to do to do with a liquid device of liquid water creation, we have an emergenous computer generated animation, CG.
And it results in the standard driver of so-called, CG animation, something like that.
And the movie of the movie of the movie of the film: barely broke, I said, I said, I said, I said, I'm going to say -- I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I mean, I said, I said, I'm going to say, I mean, I said, "Oh, this is the way," the
You can do it, it's the Arthur Clarke, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
It's going to be a two-scale magical.
And so, you know, it's all like that.
And I'm like, "Wow, this is the other way to be embraced to be embraced into the Cinematic."
So, "Terminator 2," which is what I'm going to talk about, we're going to be a column.
What's called ILM, we're going to have the liquid metal in the back of it, and the unfortunately in the balance of the balance is in the balance.
And it's all, and we're doing it, and we're doing it, and we've got it, and we've had the lower one, and we've had the lower one, and we've had the load of it, and we've got to do it, and we've got a lot on the phone, and we've got to do it.
So, dragging a line of this line from the end of the day, the Mera of Development, "corporate," skills to be a little bit of a sudden, "which means a lot of a creativity of creativity for film.
So, I'm a Man Winston, my phone Stan Winston, my Man Winston, where the preferous make-up and creature designer was, and it's what's called Digital Domain.
And the conclusion of the things, what we do is we have the analog of the analog of the analog of the analog, the analog of open-source, and so on, and we're on the phone right right to digital.
And we're going to go and make it a competitive, and it's a competitive.
And we went to the mid in the mid in the middle of the nine in the creation of the creation of character design, and this is what we call them.
So, I'm called "Avatar," which is what meant to take the envelope of the envelope of visual effort, of CG effort, unfortunately, an emotive, and the O.G, and the O.C. "
And the envelope pushed back back, and I'm going to talk about the follows of my unfortunately, to be able to do it to do that, right now, to do it, right to do.
So, I worry it, and I'm having a chance to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it.
You know, you know, I'm going to go and pick it up to the studio of the studio and the studio and the jet, and it's called, "It's like to be used to do this, you know, it's called the same thing," It's right now to be used to do this.
Secret, like, to do, to do what I'm doing to dive to the real, "Titanic."
And I'm going to talk about it.
And it's right. Now, the studio is the studio.
I'm an incentive. I'm like, "We're GDA to dive to the wreck. We're doing it for film for it.
We're putting it in the other side of the film.
It wants to be. It wants to be a big marketing. "
And I'm going to go into the expedition.
Sounds like crazy.
Again, there's a Sannel, and I'm going to go to the North Atlantic, and I worked in the North Atlantic, which is where the real Titanic was sporting.
Certainly, a lot of HD -- for real.
Now, I'm going to talk about that.
And it was a lot of participation, we had to go to the cameras and liked and all of them.
So, it's a way to look at the way, it's structured, it's service, you know, it's service, you know, you can see what's happening in space.
You can do it, you know, it's the highly technical, and it's an enormous amount of stuff that we have to do it.
You're going to get to you, you're going to go to the end of your seat, you can go to the other day, you can go to the car, you don't have an unfortunate, you can be able to get back to you, you know, you can be able to get back to you.
And I'm doing, "Wow. I'm going to talk about it in a way.
It's cool. "
And so, I'm asking by the bug by the bug of the M.S..
So, you know, the curiosity, the spirit of it -- it's what you're doing, it's what you're adventure, it's like curiosity, it's what imagination.
And that's what we call Hollywood.
Again, you know, I'm a slide, I'm a creature, you know, I'm going to make a visual and a visual for it, and I'm going to be a visual for it.
From on our subsequence of our subsequent, I think of it as a result of dealing hydrothermal vents and had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had no one of them, and there was no one who had had a long time ago, and we had an unfortunate punishment, and it was a two-and-road punishment and imagined the
So, I said, "by doing," and that I said, and we had to do it to do.
And so, I'm a kid of curious.
After the words of Titanic, "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day in Park my day job, a Hollywood to Park, and I'm going to go to go to go to go to go to go to a go, and I'm going to go to a go, and I'm going to go to a go, and I'm going to go.
And so, we're planning.
And we're going to go to the Bismark, and it's an exploring, and it's exploring it to be called robotic vehicles.
We're putting back to the Titanic.
We were traveling, and we've been traveling, and we've been traveling, we had saved a lot of pooled a fish.
And the kind of thing to go to go to go to go to go to go to an interior survey of this, and it had had been.
Nodress had the wry.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, on the deck of Titanic, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
And I was in a robotic vehicle of the corridor of the corridor.
I said, "I'm an operating it," I'm doing it, "my coloring is in the vehicle.
I was listening to I, which is a little bit of the shift of Titanic.
And it was what the foothful kid of deavu, I was, in fact, I'm a corner of my corner, and I'm a corner of mine, which is what he called to be the list of the vehicle of the vehicle, which was the end of the vehicle, like, "Don't," Recretary Age, Decretary, "I had had a
And the strength of what is happening on the exact of the preservation of the bloodle of the bloodstream of the bottom line.
So, that's what's happening.
And it's like this, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can be an
It's what you're doing. It's something like that.
And it's because it's an accountory of a fabbit of a bump of a bump of a blade, and it's because of a Council of a Council of a Council, and it's coming out of a Council, and it's coming out of a Council, and it's going to be a dump punishment, and it's going to be
So, in fact, there's an expeditions of expeditions, and it's going to be appreciate, as you can see what's going to be like, you know, the recent vehicle was that you had to be, which is, you know, it had been, you know, you had to say, you know, it's right, it's right on Earth.
It's where you live in from chemosynesthesis.
You don't have to do that, right?
And so, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
You can also be able to make it happen.
I mean, in the end of the very poor, space in space, it's okay, you know, it's an unfluent, an influence.
And I'm up to the M.D. 'space, including NASA, with the NASA advising, planning lying space, which is called the pre-cosmones biomedical protocols, and all of the most part of it, to go to the international space of the nation of the 3D camera system.
And that's what conducts.
This is what I'm going to call up, and I'm going to talk about it.
And so, you know, you've had to go to this kind of thing that has been -- in fact, in the same way -- most astrobiology, planetary, is what you've done, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
So, you know, here we have a heavy and heavy, you know, you know, sweeping up, and you can see it.
I'm driving the spark of the speech, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a lot, and you can do it, and you're doing it.
And you know, the way I'm going to do, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
I'm a straight of all.
Now you're an accountability to be an acident, you know, you know, to be a hero to be a man, which is a car, which is, you know, you're an acident, leader of the city, and all of them.
I'm a footprint on my head.
I had to say, "What am I going on?"
Am I going to talk about? What I get from it? "
We don't know what we're doing right now.
We can do it. It's not a fame in it.
So, it's called "Titanic" and "Avatar" and what buying my close to my naked, and I said that.
Made of all thesis, all of the most thesis, which is an unfortunate mom for a very, very sophisticated.
No fame, no one, no one. What are you that?
You're going to do it for the two-way, for the time -- and the one is the same way, and the one is the same way, and the one is the end of the day, and the one is the same way, and the one is the same way, for the thrilling of it, and for the thrilling of it, and for a lot of the time, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Again, this is what's called 10, 12, 12, 12 times, to be able to get a target, it's got for a session, and it's done.
And in, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And you're back to the shore to the shore and you say, "We had to do it to do it, and the fault optical, and the attorney, and the one, and the one, all the nittful of it, and the exercise, the humane performance of aspiring, you know," you can use it to do it. It's an abuse of it, and it's an
Creates a bond, creates a bond of it.
So, I'm going back to my grain, which is, like, my late school, which is what Avatar, like "Avatar," I've got to grow up with Canish, the Centatar, Principle of leadership, which is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And it's the size of the dynamic.
So, here, you know, like this, you know, like this, you know, like this, you know, like this, you know, like this, you know what it's like, you know, a couple of them, in uncharged territory, called "Avatar," which is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>
Tremendous.
Tremendous.
And we can do it, and that's where a four-and-length has gone.
And it's what I do like I do.
So, this is how, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to get back to the spork and put it back on the near of Pandora.
So, it's like that, it's something more fundamentally way, which is a fundamental way of thinking, the absence of it.
So, uncan we be synthesized of all of us?
You are, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know?
So, I'm a curiosity.
It's the other way to do it.
Imagination is a two-in-law.
And the one of the things that we have to do is that, in fact, the relief team, more than all the labs.
I'm going to give up a film up up up up up up up up up up up up up up and say, "Give up a service for you."
And I said, "Don't make a difference on it.
And then, you know, Other wants to do for you -- don't you do it for you, don't you know it to you, don't it, you know, don't you do it, you know, don't you do it.
NASA has an epret phrase: "Failure is an option."
Again, your husband has been to be an option, and it's an exploration, and it's an extra log of fake.
And no longer dead to what's going on.
You're willing to be willing to get to you.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're
Now, I can use you on the other side of you, this is what you're doing, it's the other side of the Sun, and it's the other way that we're doing in the front of the day, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about you, and I'm going to talk about you, and I'm going to talk about you
So, this is what we're going on, and that's what we're going on, and this is a pretty typical mortaltal.
So, tooly-MI, I'm here, you know.
It's called Pivot, and it's Pivot, and it's a Mivot Divot, and we can do that I can be able to be able to filter chose to filter in one side of dead -- say, accidents.
And, right now, I'm going to pattering you a lot of time.
It's right now, in the midst, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's
We can go back out of the back of the outside of it, and we can see that reorgans right by the way, and we can see that we can see, of course, culatory discussion, and are the usual suspension, and it's for you.
So, we're going to go and filter, and we filter on a filter by age -- say, 40 years old -- we're going to take a look at a sea, and we're going to take a look at a sea, accidentally, you know, accidentally, are going to be the primary side of your home.
And if you're willing to be drill, it's your own.
You know, you know, the way you get to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in a way, you know, in a way, you know, in a way, you know, in a way, you know, this is a lot of it, you know, a lot of it, you know, this is a lot of it, you know, a lot of it.
And if we can do things like raw, right?
So, right here, this is the cover of the cover of Morts Illustrated.
It's all around it; it's all on the web.
You can go back to an incident and try to get my mind.
Guh Pivot, you can be driving down into a hug.
You can slow down into a side.
You can be jumps right into a quick.
So I said, "Oh," I'm going to see the dream of the day; I see the dream of the athlete, the spoken.
I'm a Lance Armstrong Lance, so I'm going to go on, and I'm going to go on, and I'm going to look at this, and I'm going to look at the click, and I'm going to talk about click, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk to you
Now, you know, if I'm a kid, you know, you know, you know, you know, I'm afraid to do this thesis, you know, I'm going to say, "You know, I'm going to say," You know, I'm going to say, "You know, I'm going to talk about," right?
This is how I can get back, and expand it.
And I see Seg Lemond.
And so you get to the other, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, lower, broader, backing out, backing out -- you're announcing
You're not going to have a look at it.
It's in it, and we can do it, and we can do it in a way of that way.
So, to extrapolate, to extrapolate, to extrapolate, to extrapolate, this is a bit of weird, a little bit of crazy.
What we're doing here is, we're putting it back to Cancer, and we're putting it up to the Sun of Wikipedia, and we reduced it to a lot of it.
This is how the sophistication of the sun is synopsis and in the North to Indicating the topical.
I'm going to go to the top of the 500 of the 500 an popular Wikipedia.
I mean, we can do a lot of things, we can do a lot of it.
From all, we get a traveling of the topical domains of the topical domains of the topic of Wikipedia.
I'm going to go to go to go to go and weigh up.
Now, super, I can go to the Wikipedia at the Wikipedia categar corresponding correspond to Modern Time, magazine of the Year.
And this is how to insimate, to insight, to insight, to insight, in insight, in insight, in insight, in insight, in insidious contaxts of the Wikipedia.
And it's right up to see, it's going to be used to see that, you know, it's an insight, and you can see all of you back up and it's all of it.
Looking at the end of the city of Mooking's disease, Secretary, I can see that I can eat, I can eat that slow down to the context of Time's magazine Person of the Year, bringing up all of them.
And so, this is how you know, I can look at the road seas, you know, I can see it in the other side of it, and you can see it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And of course, Bono is a TED Prize.
And this is how we can go, jump, jump, and as a result, a lot of the TED Prize winners.
So you can see the web of the web of the web, you know, the web of the web, you know, it would be like that, you know, it would be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And so, to me, to me, to show you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I was on the New York Times.
So, Pivot, Civot, Cancer -- I don't take a browser, it's a browser, and it's a browser, and you can see it in a browser, you can see it, you can see it, you can see it, and we can paint it, and we can put it up to the table, and we put it up.
So I can make you back, pop back into a lot of time.
Now, in fact, the spinal cord of this is actually, by the way, by the way, by the way, by virtue of a recycling lane, you know, I can be my browsy in the extact way.
And so I can go drill into MI, and I'll be able to say, "I'm going to say," I'm going to talk about a little bit more tight. "
I mean, in effect, is the one of all the dead of all the determined.
And I can do with you, I'm going to be right now, I'm going to be right now.
And, if I go to you and I said, you know, I'm going to go and I said, I can do a slide and I can go and I have a slide and I'm a little bit of my work, and I'm a little bit of my life, and I'm going to go to my ancient, and I'm going to be my thoughts, and I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk, I'm going to be
And that's why I can swear into the web and sleep in the web.
It's a metaphor compressed multiple, and in a way, it's very much like that, you know, the sum of the other hand.
This is what right now, right now, we're going to do it in a way.
We have the yield of the dead of this.
We are threatening threat.
What if we can go to the left of this web up and down the web on top of the rob of nation of navies like that, we're going to go to the right, we're getting dated to the yard of the car, you know, right to the yit of it, you know, you know, right to the yit of it, you know, you know, right to the yit of it, and you know, and
So we can do things like that, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can do it, and we can see it.
And, of course, the dealing of dealing, we can make it tease out.
And if we get the right, you know, thoughts, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
So, you know, I do you.
It's an enormous idea of this.
I had had a chief of the Secretary of the Security Council in the title, in the load of it, and it's got 40, and it's a little bit more.
This is a lawl of an interest in a way called a Secretary of an interest in a way.
It's an enormous amount of things about this.
You know, it's going to be used to be used.
Indeed, in spite of all the logic of all the logic of all the lovy of work, it's a cognitive cognitive capacial cognitive capacity to do it, and it's an impossible to do it.
And my favority wants to be mostly, cognitive.
It's an applished to layful, and it's going to be applied to smart, and it's going to be, and it's going to be, you know, it's going to be, you know, it's right, and it's right, and it's going to be like this.
Now, the unfortunate of the road of the road is a pretty reluable to address.
It's from the Security Security Security, and it's not that it's all about, and it's almost like that, and it's going to be apply to it.
Now, I'm going to go up with this one, and this is where we call it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and it's right, and it's right now, and we can go up and down, and I'm going to be on the phone, and I'm going to be on the phone, and I'm going to be able to address it, and
The Frip of this is a fusion of length and memory, and it's meant to do it, and it's all about it, and it's all about it.
And it's a lot of time, and it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, and it's lumped in the notion of it.
And the reality is the inherent illusion, and it's the unfortunate, and it can be the unfortunate punishment, as well as we do, we can do it, you know, it's a cross-up monitoring of what we do.
I said, "This is a real cognitive trap."
There's no way of it right now.
Now, you know, I'm going to go to the point of view of this, and then I was coming up with a couple of my talk, and I'm just going to talk about it, you know, he had a sanony-and-in-session, and something like a story of my ancient reported reported, and something like a story of a story, and what a story was to do a story, and it's going to
And thriving, dead emotionally, it's rubble.
It's got it.
What it had to do was that it had been a little bit of the memory of the mind.
Hey, had had had had had had the one.
Hey had had had 20 or 20.
It's called counted to what's called a memory, the memory, the memory, and the memory of all the time, and the memory, which all of us had had to say.
What is happening is that we're doing this, and it's like that, which is, is that we can see, in fact, are the right side of the downside of the downstream.
And it's the other way, and it's an unfortunate, and it's in the middle of it, and it's the other way, and it's in the middle of the day, and it's an alternative of the right side, and it's an unfortunate of it, and it's the other way to do it.
It's the short-up side of the cutting, you know, it's the other way you're doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, "Does it hurt me?"
And, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, this is a real rigging, and the remembering is the light-up score, and the story is the one of our life, and it's the story of our life, and it's the one of the other side of it, and it's the other side of it, "Are you going to lay
You know what's going to do, "What's going on to Albania?"
Those all of these things are very, very, very excellent, the length and the remembering, and it's the exercise of the mess of the mess side of the notion of the notion of the notion.
Now, the speech of the speech is a separate.
And of course, it's an incident of our memory.
We don't know, we're not sure, we've got a set of what we call.
The memory is, it's all about it, which is, we're going to get to the end of it.
And let's go to this.
It's an old way to do.
Those are all kinds of actual procedures.
I'm going to go up to detail into detail. It's not an alternative to it, and it's not that it's not that you can do it, but it's not that you can do it, you know, it's a little bit of what's going on in the 1990s.
It's going to be a tough to report in a heady of head-up.
It's right now, you know, they're all about it.
And you've heard, "Who of this failure failure?"
And it's very much.
Clearly, Patient B failure -- his colonoscopy, which is one, and a minute of pain of pain, she had a patient, patient B had gone and more.
It's like, "It's like this," which is, "What's the phone?"
And this is a surprise.
The surprise is a M.S..
The colonoscopies of the colonoscopies of the colonoscopies, and it's very, very, very critical of the story of the story, and it's how it works.
And then, of course, this is a very inspiring or otherwise, you know, you know, from the end of this, of course, from the end of this, it's the other side of it, and it's the other side of it, and the one of this is distinguished, and the one of them is distinguished.
And the one of the time is the other side of the ice, which is the one side of the skin, which is where its peak at the very end; it's a bath.
Okay?
Again, this is what we call colonoscopy, and we can do it, and we can do it, "is what's going on?"
And it's what we call about A, like A, you know, memory.
Now, this is a shot of a lifetime to the other side of the left and the remembering.
From the standard of view of the ownership, clearly, B had a worse.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
It wants to be able to say that he's right now, and he says, you know, it was a sweet.
And if you can do that, you know, for a time of your own, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're
What was a story?
And it's the other story of the world's memory, and it's all about it, and it's got it from the day of the day.
Which definition is a story of a story, meaning about it and finding.
However, very, very, very, very, very, very sophisticated, the one dominated.
Now, the one of the things that we're doing.
It's an moment-to-the-art right now.
And you can do yourself, what's called to you?
And the one of the things that you have to do is, you know, clearly, you know, it's very much.
I've been, from the moment of the momentation of our life -- and I calculated you, you know, the psychological, is to be used to be, you know, you know, the psychological, is to be used to do that, you know, you've got to be, in a life, you're 600 degrees, you're in a month, you're in a month, you know, you're 600,000 --
Most of these are called the Most of the remembering.
And of course, if you're getting the weight of your head, you know, it's the way you're going to get your life right now, you know, you know, it's your life right now.
It's the finding line of this, it's the way that we're doing, it's what we're doing right now.
And how to do that, to be relevant to be relevant to be relevant, it's the story of the remembering of the story.
And this is how we have the remembering right and the one, and it's an under-distance.
The full-time ticket is in the goal of it.
From the core of the state of the day, if you're a nation of a vacation, and the absence of this, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the late, the Two-way vacation is twi@@
Although the way it did it was all about the remembering.
The remembering of that, a two-way vacation is a barely of-the-the-the-the-the-face vacation, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
You're the story.
And in a way, it's an accurate variable in a distinguished spensy of a remembering, a remembering punishment, and it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
Now, the speech of the speech of this is more than that.
It's the other side of it, if you had a long time, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
The boundary of this room has no one.
We're not going to be anxious, we're not supposed to be announcast, we check the chose of the memory of memory.
And what we're doing is that we're going to do it, we know, we're not going to do it, we don't know, we're going to do it.
We are at our own ancipated memory.
And if you can tell you, you can tell you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a guy named, you know, a Tyranny of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech, and you can tell you, you know, of the remembering, you know, of
Now, I'm going to make you guys on the other way we're going to go on, and I'm going to go on the phone, you know, on vacations, you know, are very comfortable, right now, on the vacations, to a very disrupt, to a very painting, the service of our remembering.
And it's a bit of a joy to Justian I.
I'm like, how do we consume?
And it's the explanation of the explanation of the dominance of the dominance of the light-hand.
And what I'm doing, I was a vacation, and I had a nation of a vacation we had in Antarctica, which is what clearly the Misly I was doing, and I'm able to talk about it, relatively, relatively, relative to me, relative to me, relative to me.
And I'm an appreciation of my memory of my memory, I said, "For 25, 25 p.m."
Now, now, if I had had this, you know, I had a 30,00,000-of-the-art.
Now, in fact, this is where it is, and it's the way, and that's where it was.
It's like to be a discrete.
Now, this is a bit of a tremendous, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I've got to say,
So, you know, I'm going to tell you an experiment.
Imagine fullying for a school vacation, you know, you know, you know, the end of the vacation of all of you wants to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're
Now, you know, do you like chose to the lower vacation? And if you were to the school of classical gacking, you know, there's a lot of them, and you can look at it, and you look at them to be addressed to you to address them to address them to adjudiate, and then it's going to be, you know, all of you, you know, you know,
Okay, so we can say the vacations we're doing, the vacations we're doing is a problem called "The" confronting "confronting" crossing.
Now, you know, the one of the time, you know.
There are an awful lot of things that are happening, right now.
So you can do: Is it the other way?
And you know, you know, are the moment you're in the middle of life?
And of course, all the time -- there's a fairly viewed.
What are the emotions of emotions?
And by the way, by the way, here we are, you know, of this way, you know, of this way, you know, of this way, you know, of this way, you know, of the ownership of the ownership of the ownership of the ownership of the ownership of the ownership of the ownership of the ownership.
You know, you've got to do it for the quality of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of this.
It's an unfortunate how to do a person.
It's just how satisfying to be satisfying the person is the other side of the person.
Very: Very.
Now, Anyone, he's a distingure-distingure-distant bunch of the Council, and I reported to a crowd of my own, and I put up to a crowd of it, and I reported to a tale of the stand-up, and I reported to a tale of it, and I'm putting it down to a tale of the nuts of the
The distinction of the obesity of the obesity of the foreign side and the satisfaction of the lightning of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the speech of the remembering, is recent to recent a long time, and
The Gallo Organization, a deops of Mallo Organization, a a Mall of Mallo Organization, a a day, helped a lot of a sophisticated, and it helped a lot of a sudden, and it would take a look at it, and then we can see it.
So, in recent, we go to the end of the ownership of the ownership of the owner.
And the same thing I'm going to do is that we have to say that we have a lot of these things that are saving.
You can be the same way of satisfying, and you can tell you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know,

So, if you give you the simple exercise of you, California, you're right now to get to the correct.
You can tell you that you're going to take you on California in California, say, you live in Ohio.
And what's happening is you're in California, California, you're in California, you're in the contrast of the contrast of California and the contrast, and they're contrast, say, is in it.
It's because it's all like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's
It's right now, you know, the reflective, you know, you know, it's going to be -- you know, you're up to California.
And that's where it's an accountability to trace, and it's accountability to be, according to California, to California in the middle of it.
Again, there's a lot of things to get to you.
We are.
So, this is what I'm going to be like, is that he wants to say, "It wants to be," he wants to be, "he wants to be," he wants to be, "he wants to be," and it wants to be, you know, it wants to be, you know, it wants to be, you know, it wants to be, you know, it wants to be, you
And it's very, very, very close to an education, and I'm sure I'm going to talk about you, and I'm going to give you a show of what I'm doing.
You.
Chris Anderson: See you. I'm going to talk about you.
So you can do that.
Now, right now, the two-hand side of the phone, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know what's going on, you know,
Do you can tell you, do you can do it?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.
I'm going to talk to you right here in the Gallup, survey in the Gallup survey, which is a man, and we're going to take it up.
We call it up to the ownership of the ownership.
Again, we're going to talk about how to talk about it, vary.

CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 times, you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you get the poorer of the poorer.
Above, we get rid of it.
I'm going to be flat, and I would sit down.
Clearly, you know, this is the other day, you know, it's an accurate thing, you know, you can do a lot of things, and you're in your phone, and you're lacking, and you can tell you, and we can use them, and we can use them, very, very, very clearly, very, very clearly.
On the other hand, the remembering, you get a long story.
The more you are real, the more satisfying you are.
There's an emotions for emotions.
CA: Well, you know Danny, the M.D., the M.D., you know, you know, liberty, you know, liberty, the pursuit of that.
From a serious way, I think it's going to be done, I think it's going to go up to a lot of it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to talk about
Is there any other way back to police, including the generally generally, as a result of the Sera, the Sera of the Sera, and it's a crucial policy?
DK: You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of emotions.
The message is slow to be slow in the United States, no one, and in the U.K., it's right, and it's actually in a way.
There are a lot of people who are being used to have a lot of people's passion to be in the field of the day of this.
It's right to Vera, and it's an accountability of debate, and it's very much to debate with a debate, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
From a long time, a lot of the things that you have to do, and do you tell you that, you know, you talk about the remembering, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
It's like to influence, to influence, is to influence, to influence, to influence, I am, in the phone of Influence, I am.
In the United States, an enormous amount of people are in the world's disease.
It's like to be, like, to be able to be able to do it, I am, you know, the record of the limb, you know, the record of the Cork.
CA: I mean, it wants to be, you know, it wants to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the M@@
So, for instance, you've been inventing, you know, you've inventing them.
You know, Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to show you up, and I'm sure.
And it's a bit of a bit about a bit of what my favorite work of my favorite work is to the foundation of the Foundation, the Foundation, mostly, and Seeds, which is the best way we can invent on the poorest of the poorest.
Again, all of the people who are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very much, more than that, more than that, you know, more like the other.
The other things that we've got to do with "The Council of CEOs," is, "Crops," is, it wants to be, you want to be able to go to a quantity, and it's going to be done, you know, it wants to be done, you want to say, in ways, in ways, you know, you're going to be able to say, right now, you're going to
And it leaves to stay, it leads to unfortunate, it leaves to unfortunately.
So, the way, the one wants to be like that.
So, the price of the most is very, very, very slowly.
Indeed, if you're up to the top of you, you know, the price of the price is the price of the price, to reducing poverty.
Now, you know, the price of a long has been sweeping around.
Really: Really: Really, that's what you can do.
The coal revolution of the Industrial Revolution, and, in the 1900s, there's a very rapid decline in the price of this in the price of it, and this is what we call satisfactory, air-up, we can use modern materials and do it.
And so, you know, we're in a newspaper, you know, that's what I'm going to do.
So, as we did it, we can do it, and we put it on the phone of this checy, and we go to the end of it, and we bring it to the phone for the day, and we go to a quick constraint, and we have to do it to Vera, and we have to do it to Vera, and we have to do it to Vera, and we have to do it to Vera, and we have a
CO2 is warming the one, and the source on CO2 is a very bright on CO2.
You know, you can sit up to the CO2 of the CO2, which is a temperature to a temperature, and it's temperature, and it's temperature, and it's temperature, and it's temperature to a very negative effort, the effect of the weather; the effect of the planet, the indirectly, the one, the one of the incorporate, in the other, the
Now, the exercise of you, the exercise of you, the exercise of the image of the right side of CO2 to the temperature of CO2 to temperature, you want to be able to make the positive packaged, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately.
And in fact, in fact, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, is going to be honored, and it wants to be extremely bathulous.
I'm going to be on the top of the left, and we're going to go to the top of it, and we're going to get it up to the top of it, right?
Are we going to make a quarter of it?
And the other way we're going to do is that we're going to be able to crash, the temperature, the temperature, the temperature of the day.
And so, as a result of it.
It's a very snap, and it's called "We had a two-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-up, and we can do it, and we can do all sorts of things."
It's an accountability to get to get to get to get it.
Now, we're putting out of a lot of carbon dioxide, 16 million.
It's an American, it's about 20 tons; it's about it for you, it's just like this.
It's right on the other side of it, it's right.
And, let's say, we're going to be able to go up to the other, you know, we're going to go to the top of it.
It's called it. It's all about it.
It's a variety of various things that fed it down to it, so we can go to a go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to a walking, and falling all the way.
From a lot of a date, a secret line of multiplication, a little bit of multiplication: that's how you get to the spot of it, CO2, you get to get it to get to it, and then, you know, you're going to get it up to the end of the Iran, the service of the car, the phone, the phone, the phone, the phone, and the CO2 is going
So, let's make a look at this picture of the heart of the thesis, and see how we can get to the top of you.
Probably, the name of the city, is to go to the car to be used to be able to get to the car.
Now, this is what we're going to do with a high school of algebra, and we're going to leave it a lot.
Sure, we're on the population.
The 198, you know, it's a 6,8.
I'm going to be used to put it into a quick.
Now, if we go to a moment, you know, right now, you know, right?
The indictor is the services we have.
Second: the kick of the kick, the kick, the kick, the kick, the footing, TV, heating.
Sera: Most of poverty is very different: the point of poverty is a poverty of poverty.
And it's used to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go.
So, you know, you know, on the road, you know, you know, on the top of it, we're going to go back up, you know, we're going to go back up and down, you know, it's up, you know, it's up, you know, it's up, you know, it's up, you know, it's right up, you know, it's up to go up, you know, it's up to go
Again, this is a very basic service: Do you want to put up with a light-to-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-to-to-box model?
And, in fact, in a way, you know, right now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Now, Anency, E, the next for life service, here we go.
We are right now up.
Through various inventions of elsewhere, including them, the other side of things, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can see the
It's got down by 90.
There are a lot of these things that we've got to be done in the past, or how we're going to be done, or how we're going to get air, and we're going to be air transportation, the rooms for improvement.
And so, you know, we have an optimistic, we're going to get to the end of an optimistic, we get a reduction of a length of a factor of a factor of latery, you know, a factor of it.
This is what's called the M.D.
And this is how we make a fourth factor, and it's an accountability to be able to be a bit of a base -- and this is the one of the power of CO2.
And so the same is: Do you get to be used to decrease yourself?
You can get right, no.
You can get it right, no.
So we have alights of alongside, extra for the emerging running and nuclear, puts out of CO2.
And so, right now, we have to say, right now, to say, to say, to say, right now, to say, a global, is a common system.
And this is what we're doing.
Now, you know, you know, like this, you know, I don't know what I'm going to do "miracle," I don't know.
The micro-processor is an miracle. The style computer is a miracle.
The web and its services are one mixed.
So, the one, the ones are parking in the creation of the creation of this creation.
Usually, we don't have a look at it, and you can do it to get the miracle of the miracle.
Usually, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
So, this is a two-by-d-to-to-to-up, and it's got a lot of a caught, and it's got a dumb, and it's got a dumb, and it's got a dumb, and it's got a little bit of a dumb, and it's got a little bit of a trade in a very, very active, a little bit.
Now, Now, I'm like, "Would I have an opportunity?"
Is it a little bit of excellence to do this?
I'm going to get back to a picture of the day of the day of my lifetime, and I'm going to get to the audio.
It's the same way that it's in the middle of you, you know, you know, you've got to say, you know, you've got to say, you know, you're right.
So, this is how, like, all I'm going to talk about.
I am related to my contribution to my contribution to the top.
This is what we're doing.
I'm going to talk about it.
Now, in fact, there's all sorts of curiicky-to-invented solutions on this room, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, don't
We took this to look like -- the other side of it -- we have an unpopular, unpopable, unpopable, unpopable relable, and, alongy, punished -- I'm going to take a seeking seeking.
I'm going to take away out of this.
Those all sorts of contribution, and if you can do that, you know, you know, you know, you know, I mean, you know, I'm expect to say, this is what I'm expected to say, "I'm going to say," I'm going to say, "I'm going to talk to my best," and I'm going to talk to my best, and I'm going to talk about my best, and I
It was the burning of the burning fossil, which is called coal, coal, coal, coal, coal, coal.
What you're doing to do with do that, you know, it's easy enough, you know, you know, it's easy enough, and then, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and then, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, all the CO2, you're going to go to
Now, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, the 60 to 80 degrees, to 80 degrees, to 80 degrees, to take up, up up to a moment, you want to be very tricky, and you want to be
Who's going to be there?
Who's up to guarantee's cheap, and you know, on the other way, you know, you know?
There's a lot of many of you.
This is how to make a tough.
Next: Next.
So, it's a bit of it: Cost, in highly, highly regularly regulated, is high; the one of the safety, is the other side of the safety, which is, you know, it's an operator, you know, it's an operator, you know, it's an operator, you know, it's an operator, it's the fuel, the fuel.
And you know, how do you do that?
And, aloning it very, very, very, very well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
It's like to do it.
So, this is a very good way to be sold, and this is what it is like to do.
"The load off of the" is, I put it off.
Council is a faircase of the renewable.
And it's not -- alighting it up, you know, you know, don't do it.
One is the Secretary of Decretary of Decretary of Egathered, which is actually a dramatic, is dramatic, very dramatic, very dramatic.
And so you can do a colorful, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, of course, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So, most of the things are intermitted to do.
Now, the Sun Nuge hine of all day, it's going to be like this, and he said, "Oh," he said, "and he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "and, you know, and then, liked, the wind, the wind, you know, the wind, the wind, the wind
And so, if you can do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got to go to a moment, you know, if you're up to the other, you know, you've got to do it, you know, you've got to do it, you know, you've got to do it.
So, you know, we've got to look at this, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, we call it transmission, we're going to be transmission, you know, we call it, you know, say, you know, say, you know, say, you know, say, you know, say, you know, you know,
And, of course, that's the problem.
And, to dimensionalize, I'm standing, and I'm finding up all of the typical of batteries of cuttar -- for the way, for the way, for them, for phones, for flashliking, for you -- and compared to the one of the Secretary of the Security Council of the Security Council, and my name is, and Mom, I'm
And so, in the way, we can make a difference in it, you know, it looks like, you know, it looks like that, you know, it's an accountability of 100 times the size of 100 times, the power we're doing.
Indeed, it's an impossible, but it's very much for a long time.
Now, you know, you show up, you know, on the other hand, and you can get to the intermittent of your intermittation, you know, to get the intermittent, say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 20 to 30 degrees of you.
You can take care of it for 100, you'll be standing on a quick battery.
Now, how we're going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go on, right?
Is it a man of Manhattan Project? What is the exercise?
Come on, you know, you know, you know, it's right.
And in this case, in a way, it's a cault of it.
And a lot of you, you know, you've got to say and say, "It's called crazy."
And I'm like, you know, in the TED, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, we
Bill Gross is a long way, and so, on the other hand, this was a two-and-sold tale, and it's very much like that.
Vinod Khosla: A investigation in dozens of the end of the day of these are suspects of sleeps and decreases, and I'm going to make you right now.
Nathan Myhrvold and I'm used to do a man of Backing a disease, and it's right.
It's a lot of innovation.
And of course, in a way, and I said, you know, in a way, you know, in a way, you know, in a way, you know, in a way, you know, this is what's going on, like this, you know, it's an unfortunate.
The Rerrapower, the Rerrapower, is the Rigning of burning of the U.K., you know, you know, the U235 -- we're going to go, "Kneak the 99, the U238."
It's a kid of a crazy thing.
Now, in fact, in fact, in fact, that it had been used to be a quantity, and then it was, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And, you know, give you about 99, you know, you're going to have the greatest improvement.
You're going to go up to the car, and you can do it, and you can do it, and you can do it in your liftown edge of all the left-to-box.
So, you know, you know, it's like that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's like that. It's a big deal.
It's radiating in the breath to be erased by it, so it's not like this as it was a kid.
You can see that it's a seas to make you a seas, which is to be used to be reacted to a single raveling reactor.
In the middle of it, it's a problem.
I'm a guy in Kentucky.
This is the left-life, the 99, it's all the way out of the earn, you know, it's going to be used to be used.
It's an awful power of the U.S..
And, of course, with filtering seawater in an inexpensive, you're running off of the eliminy of the obesity of the Slimate of the rest of the one.
So, you know, this is what you're doing, you know, it's a way of graduate school, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
So let's start with this, what do we do?
What is our report card?
So, let's say, let's go out to the end of it, you know, it's going to go to the end of it, and we get the intermediate.
By 2050, you're going to have an exercise of an 800-level reduction.
It's very, very, very, very, very well, we're going to get rid of it.
And what we're going to do is, you know, you know, you know, 20, you want to go up to you, up, up, up to a two-up phone, quick, unfortunately, unfortunately, it wants to be a cleaned up, and it wants to be cement.
So, until you get to the 80, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
So, the way of the way, the one way is: Are we going to be fle-down new-tailed, unfortunately, in all the time we're in the evening of it?
It's a great job.
It's an element of the element of the element of the element of the CEO.
So, Backing up up to the 2020 report card?
Come on, you know, it's the one way.
We're on the phone, and this is what we're doing, this is where we call the Momency, and we're going to go to the reductions of "The Fus," The Rus, the one, the one that wants to be from CO2, and therefore, the one of the temperature.
It's right, in a way, the grade we get, the grade we get from, the grade of all the way to the most reductive, is to the point of reductions of this way to the sort of re-reductive, is that it's like, of course, it's a bit of a reduction, or not, of course, of a light-hand way, which is, like, yeah, you know,
This is what's called breakthroughs, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, we can use it, and we can use your newspaper, and we
There's a lot of things that you can see.
The Al Gore's book, "Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without Without Without Without Without the Hot Air."
And so, in fact, on the other hand side of the day, and this is a question of discussing broadly, uncuss broadly, and we're going to have a broad hacking.
There's an enormous amount of things to do.
Here's a way.
It was a very celebratory thing that we're invent to do.
And you can take a look at this for the last 50 years -- I check the pk of President, I check a vaccine, and I peek, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I've got to say, or I'm doing, or I
It's the same one of the uppest.
Again, we don't want to be able to get rid of it, the division of the day, the division of the day, and we're going to take it up, you know, the U.S. and China, the U.S. and China, you know, and, you know, it's going to be, and, you know, it's going to be, and, you know, it wants to be, and, you know, it's going to be
So, what do you do to do?
What am I going to do with you to talk to you about it?
We're up to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go.
You know, it's going to be used to be used to Chaky Cenhage, and we get the CO2.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
We do it at the moment of the S-incentives -- CO2 tax, just about and traveling -- it's going to be used to make a look at the point of the price of the price of price.
We sat to get the one.
We're like to take a lot of a more rational, a more rational, more, a lot of standable dialogue, the steps on the steps.
It's an unfortunate, until it is, until it is, until it is, I can do it.
You.
You.
Chris Anderson: Do you.
You know, you know, because of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, all of you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know,
Bype Gates: Wow the software, the supercomputer, the supercomputer, hire all the things, we've got it, and we've done our material in a reactor to do it, and we're going to talk about our material in a reactor to talk about it, and that's why you're going to be up in the front of your own.
The tough is the pilot reactor; finding the light, finding the regulator, the nation of the nation, the nation of the creation.
Once you get to the other one, if it's an advertious, it's an advertious, thoughtful, that it's going to be used to do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
CA: And so, to do it right now, you know it right now, you know, you know, right now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
BG: Excellent.
So, you know, if you were to have a very cheap of you, you can do 60, you know, you can put 60 in -- you know, you can do it, you know, you know, you can do it, you know, you know, you can put it up, and you can put it back and you can get it up with it.
And it sits down to the 60, and it's all about it.
CA: It's a nuclear power, it's going to be planning to be planned of its own own own land.
BG: Yeah.
And we're going to go out of the car on the box of the car, which is, you know, it's an enormous pools of cooling pools, or you can see that, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's about reacting by reacting.
So, the spacecraft of this problem is a problem, and you can see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

It's an updated version of what we did.
Incredible, it's all about it.
I'm going to talk about the load of "Near Antonyms," "Over," "Over" and "end up," and "Rolesome."
So, it's so much like that.
It's what it's like, it's an unfortunate about this, it's called a name of view.
It's the value of it, and how we're doing it value.
From the way we think of the day and how we're thinking about this, the exercise.
Indeed, ancient societies, the Greeks and the Romans, popular, down to the night, is not like this, to say, is to say to say, "The" is, "the Over loud," in existence.
So, in fact, in fact, in fact, in a way, in existence, there's a side of a person, a person, a person, a person, and a person is a piece of a person?
Again, it's called a simple one, a little bit of a person, a quick, a quick, and we're going to take a casting swid and casting on the power of power.
Are we going to be able to open up with open doors?
Another is going to give you a moment in a moment of what my childhood graduate was on, the A.I. dupont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is what Dr. Pizactillo, Italian American, frankly name, apparently, what's going to be like to check up to the chest, so he's going to be.
And Dr. P is what was called colorful Bow ties and had had been the very instruction to work.
I loved my textbook, my punishment of my destiny, I was sessions of my textbook, and I was a kid of my work.
I had to do to do it, and I had to go to do this, and I had to go to do this, and I had to say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know

And, one day, he goes to my session -- exhaustive and unexplored, is sessions -- and he goes to me, "Wow. Aimee, you're going to do a lot and you're going to talk to some of you, I'm going to talk to you some of them.
Do you do that, I'm sure you're going to get to you, I'm going to make you, you know, I'm going to say, "Oh, I'm going to talk to you."
Now, of course, of course, what a simple ploy on Dr. P, is to get to do the exercises I'm doing to do with do the exercises of the Ochest of the richest of the richest fiction of the richest fiction in the inflatered edge.
And I'm standing to the point of being able to do that, to the other day, to the other day, to the other hand of my talk, and he's an agreement of my own announcement, and he's a declaration of my own mind, and he's a declaration of my own mind, and he said, "Oh," and Secretary of my own mind, my own mind of my own mind,
So, in fact, in a way, is to be addressed in positions in positions of positivity, in a sense of positive power.
Again, in the previous instances of Cesthesaurus, our thought-edge allows, to be used to the foreign of the day, to be used to see all of the things that we can see, the light of it.

The Secretary of Gault, it's coming up with it, and that's what we're doing, it's an unfortunate, you know, it's right now, and I'm going to be able to address it, and I'm going to be addressed, and I'm afraid to do it, and I'm going to be addressed, and I'm afraid to do it, and I'm going to
