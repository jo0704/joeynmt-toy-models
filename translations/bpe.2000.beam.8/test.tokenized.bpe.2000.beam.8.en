Several layer , TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow .
And the very pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple : teams of the Middle At the test standing up the talling of the test in 20 sticks of spaghetti , and one yard of tape , on-yard of Sting and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow hand is to be .
And , in fact , it &apos;s a simple thing , and it &apos;s hard to pretty much definitely whether it &apos;s a little bit of collaborative on collaborate .
And so I think about what was going on , and I incorporated it into a design shop .
And so what a huge is looking for .
And then , you know , I &apos;m spending 70 designs in 70 design , and I designed and designers and architects , the CTOs of the Fortune &apos;s 50 , and the CEO of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortun@@
So , normally , it &apos;s taken by orienting themselves in the world .
First of all , characteristics out of the way they look at it .
There &apos;s a lot of planning planning , organizing , sketch on the spaghetti .
This is the majority of the majority of chembling the sticks into ever-sized .
And then finally , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , like , you know , outside the marshmallow , and it turns out to be like , and it turns out to be like , and it was standing , and it was a day , and it was a day .
On the heart of the day , it &apos;s called the &quot; tye &quot; and &quot; Tuh-oh &quot; &quot; Congo of the marshmallow circuit &quot; collapse and collapse .
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of stuff like that , you know , it &apos;s a lot of &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment , and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates .
OK , so , you know , you know , cheat , the map of districted and so forth .
And of course , of course , technically teams of people who are going on , and it &apos;s like , &quot; tac-da &quot; worth , and among the absolutely recent graduate .
And it was amazing .
At Peter tells us , perhaps , you know , you know , you know , pretty much , you know , pretty much , you know , what &apos;s going to be done is the most important thing in the world .
So the bottom line : is that ? Why ? What is it ?
And Peter likes to say , you know , you know , none of the Men of the PEOs , you know , CEO of Spaghetti , Inc. Right ?
It &apos;s not a little bit of jucky power .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a well .
And the reason is a bunch of business , trained in the middle of the Earth right , right ?
And the execute on it .
And the way is , it &apos;s the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top , and it &apos;s a little bit out of it .
It was a crisis .
Right ? Right .
What major do differentiate is called the marshmallow , and a sharing prototype , successive prototype , checing the marshmallow , white multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way .
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project .
And then , rather version , they get strong feedback , and that &apos;s what they do .
So the thing in prototyping with a prototype is essential , and let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on .
So the average for the average is , you know , in the average , by 20 inches -- business schools , a half of them ; lawyer , a purpose , you know , instead of being , you know , a down-advanced station , even three-distant , funny , evidence .
Who does this matter ?
Architect and engineer , thanky .
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world .
And so on , you know , it &apos;s going to be the potential and self-cleanly geetetrical powered geetrical patterns in the world .
So CEOs , a piece of that CEOs , a little bit of an average , and it &apos;s coming up with that .
You put you on executive adminances on the team , the significantly .
It &apos;s called you . You know , you &apos;re going to go , you go , you go , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Win the way . &quot;
You can be conscious . You can get it .
It &apos;s a little bit of skills of divertation .
Sometimes the project is the project .
And whatever , you know , team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team .
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong .
You know , you &apos;re having typically a type of typical performance , you &apos;re going to get you , you know , you get some kind of thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s the way that you have , you know , it &apos;s kind of like this .
And I tried .
I do , let &apos;s go once .
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning .
So , how do you know , how do you get to be done with a design definition of design ?
What about the world ?
And he said , &quot; No one team had had a standing in a standing .
Now , anyone had a piece of sharing , say , &quot; On one in the middle of the world , the price of the brain .
Like , isn &apos;t it ? However stacking , staces , staces , stacks impact .
We arrived at the exercise on the exercise .
What do you do ?
So now , the value of prototyping .
So this is the bottom of the very , very much , the very way to do the same thing in the world .
You know , the tallest of it in the least is in the least amounts .
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a marshmallow , you know , you &apos;re a marshmallow ?
And the reason is that I have a process of processing tools and processed into the process of taking video games and visual effects .
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day .
Frankly , frankly , the project has marshmallow , but it &apos;s like ?
The challenge provides provides the challenge , and a slide of a long time , a little bit of a purpose to the build the right .
And so , you know , the value of the Central of the City of the exercise .
And it &apos;s like you &apos;re going to be able to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It takes a bunch of a bunch of it , and it goes into the marshmallows .
Final by-step-by-step steps .
You know , it &apos;s a little bit of crazy fuzy , you know , it &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be an advertising system .
You know , there &apos;s an autonomous type of people who are there .
And the fundamental lesson , I think , is a design , design is a contact .
It demands on it , and it goes all of our head to the top , and it goes up the very all of our own , our fellow , our fellow and our case to the challenge .
And , you know , a prototype of Earth &apos;s prototype , you know , it &apos;s all the way to turn it into a two-oh type of moment to a nuh-oh .
And that &apos;s a little bit differently .
All right .
Let &apos;s move forward right now .
A more machine , a cool , TEDish machine , and it machine , it machine .
And you put it in the way to get it into it .
And you can go , you can go goods , you can go forwards ; you can &apos;t have you .
And I wonder , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was boreful , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , you know , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and you know , all the way to go to
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to go to go to go to go back and Twitter , or Twitter , &quot; American Idol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I was Convinced , of course , of pull to nostalgia , to knowing you .
And I do .
I mean , I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to go to go back , and it &apos;s called an adventurous way .
It &apos;s offering the possibilities of being planet to be planet , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be done , you know , Congo .
As I do to get it in the machine , and I graduated from Gochine .
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the case , and it &apos;s based on the case , by the planet , by whatever messy , you know , to choose , and Walth , mobility , denial , declining rates of disease ...
It was a matter of mind .
My great-graded participation , all of the story , by the power of 60 .
My grandparents pushed 70 .
My participation of my participants are wrong in 80 .
This is how the beginning of my death was the beginning of my death .
After all , it &apos;s a bigger , and it &apos;s a bigger deal .
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi , excited to live Earth &apos;s lichest in the world , in the middle 100 , you &apos;re born .
Think , you know , it &apos;s going to be done for that .
And does it happen ?
Smallpox . Smallpox kiled billions of work on the planet .
It reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a Dvanished .
We vanquish it . Puff .
For example , in the same time , threatened millions of us there is no longer , hardly .
Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
Do you see anyone in your mind ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to be fed billions of stuff , the Tentific of the Center method .
And to my mind , the Cententific method -- stuff out out , searched if it works on , is one of the Saccomplishments of humanity .
That &apos;s the way we look at it .
Infortunately , it &apos;s all the way news , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit problems , and it turns out to be done .
And one of the story is that all our accomplished all our accomplishments , a trillion of goes to get to get hongry in your head .
You know , it &apos;s called the rising , and it &apos;s a very rapidly rapidly , and it &apos;s very rapidly .
And , you know , that &apos;s where our imagination to honor thoroughly drash .
Potal water , Arabland , rainforests , oil , gas , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , and innovate and innovate , innovate in the way out , you know .
So the thing is , Can we do ? And I can do it .
I mean it was clear to be able to do it , I want to get food , it wants to be a little bit of billions of the Earth , and it goes into the country , and it &apos;s listening to the country .
I like to do that , the destroy of power , destroy .
I do it , and I don &apos;t know it &apos;s going to be in the way .
Every one of the Earth keeps coming up with the Earth keeps up , and one of the Earth keeps going up with night : We &apos;re going to be progress in Conence more than that right now .
And so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can .
We have the verge of amazing , and yet I &apos;ve gone to go to go to go to go back to go , 300 people , the Enlightenment , to the British Age Age Age Congress , who was going to be a little bit of the progress , and let &apos;s be farmed with front of the day , and on the moment , front ,
Peating wrap is very popular , and so you know , it &apos;s so ugly the way you can do it .
On the audience wants to go .
And , listening , contemplated with their opinion , the Contled population of being progressed .
Do you know how to you ?
You knew entirely on your own . Sorry , you know .
And I &apos;m going to spend it up to figure out .
There &apos;s a story , I wrote a story , Vaccine for The New Yorker .
And I think it &apos;s a popular opposition : the opposition to it is , it &apos;s all of the world &apos;s effective public about it .
I do to do it , I do , like , I wrote , I wrote , I wrote , and I was a mobile .
And so , I wrote a story , I wrote a story .
Same one , more bigger .
Pew &apos;s crazy .
So I wrote a story about this story , and I was puzzling yourself , and the Frankenfoods , which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark , rather than a haphazard way , which puzzling itself , which puzzling itself .
You know , you &apos;re doing it , I do . I wrote the story , I was mobion .
I have a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re falling , we &apos;re dinner dinner . It was dead .
Right , thanthfully , I was born bothered , and I couldn &apos;t do some people out there , and eventually I do .
And in the middle of Seratics , in the middle of the mazy , whenever it &apos;s going to happen in the world .
Same amazing thoughful , educated equipment .
It &apos;s going to be exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same .
And it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
As I do , you know , you &apos;re honest .
We ended up in the middle of Earth , and we don &apos;t know , in the car , the relationship of relationship in the world .
We do it ambivalding .
We do it in ironic terms , &quot; Congress . &quot;
Okay , I think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for you , and I &apos;m going to be able to think about it .
We got to institutions in institutions , in authority , and in terms of this stuff , and there &apos;s no idea that we shouldn &apos;t go .
You can say , &quot; You can say , &quot; and you want to be able to do it .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass deeply , hanging .
You can do you can do you can get your choose .
Now , it &apos;s the purpose of all the way in the world , and it &apos;s a little bit of a problem , and it &apos;s a little bit of skepp .
Ask : For example , demand the first , demand evidence .
Don &apos;t do anything .
So here , you get it all the way : you &apos;re going to get a little bit , you know , you &apos;re going to get your acceptance on account .
And the reason I can say , the idea is that , in an epidemic of the epidemic of being , you know , you &apos;re in the epidemic of an image of an II .
About 12 , which is a story that was published , a horrible story , a horrible story , the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
Very scary .
Tons of stuff like this is going to be looking at seeing what &apos;s true .
For example , tons of study like this , it &apos;s serious issues .
All the way .
The bottom of the United States is called the United States , in England , Sweden , Ganada , and it &apos;s all the thing : no correlation , no one , none at all .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a matter of charge , and it &apos;s called the anecdotes , we think it &apos;s the way we look at seeing it , and we &apos;re in the middle of the sea , literally we &apos;re seeing it , and it &apos;s the real thing .
We don &apos;t have a level of documents of documents , and it &apos;s a government official , and I do , I said I was doing all the things .
You know ?
The results of it is an amazing thing .
Disastrous : The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs in the world &apos;s vaccine rate for measles .
It &apos;s discovery , and it &apos;s an ashamed of it .
It was horrible .
What about a child of a child ?
Now now , I do . I do it .
Do you see , you know , there &apos;s some kind of maps of maps ?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles ?
There are very much .
Again , if you &apos;re going to , you know , downstairs , you know , it would be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like 160,000 in the water .
A lot of death of measles -- 20 .
For example , it &apos;s going to be done , and we can put it out of our minds , and you know , Jenny McCarthy can be preaching McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy McCarthy , Oprah , Oprah , &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry K@@
And the thing you can do is , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to get out of this , and it &apos;s going to be done by making correlation .
It &apos;s not very much , though , that &apos;s the bottom of the bottom .
And it goes back to that .
It &apos;s a little while , Jonas Salk .
Heap of the type of the source of some of the stuff like this .
No fear , no agony . Polio -- puff , gone .
It &apos;s a bad guy in the middle , which is how much .
His name is Paul Offit .
Hey hey , a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff .
It &apos;s called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning .
Pretty , right ?
After all , the Paul Paul Paul goes , you know , I &apos;m going to go to get vaccine , and I think of it as valuable , and you know , it &apos;s going to be like this .
Here &apos;s how it goes .
So , Paul &apos;s Ana terrorist .
And Paul spaks in a public performance , it &apos;s going to be the testify machinery .
However , he asked him to go , and he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him .
And hold , Do Paul was vaccine .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t say , say , vaccines are essential .
You see , you know , you have a disease , you know , horrible discussion .
We human measles in the world .
And it turns out that , and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtue of it , and it &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to be on the front of it .
And you know , there &apos;s a huge thing to the of measles .
What does polio ? Let &apos;s do it ? Why ?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks , and it &apos;s like , I know , I do something .
There &apos;s no one .
She switched into the vaccine , you know , a polio , no way .
Fine .
Why ? Let &apos;s go on polio .
We &apos;re going to be the polio in the hyesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know , you know , this guy is , you know , a guy in Lagos in Lagos in Lagos , and he &apos;s going to go to LAX , right now .
And then there goes up to a couple of hours in a couple of couple of hours , there &apos;s a car running a car , and then go to Long Beach , and this is a little bit of pattern TED dinner .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be a paralytic disease , and we &apos;re going to be paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t have anything else in the bottom of the bottom of it .
And the planet is the planet on the planet , and there &apos;s a pretty predent about it .
Now , you know , well , in the way , you know , we &apos;re going to go on to do it . We do to do it .
You know , Everyone &apos;s vitamins in the morning ?
Echinacea , a type of antioxidant to get you .
I &apos;m going to do you a half of American .
Now , the stuff of the stuff , and it &apos;s called the stuff of alternative medicine , and as a result of it , as a result of them , how many times we look at the top of it .
This is all the material .
You know , it &apos;s like that , you know , there &apos;s an old thing .
It &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re a little billion dollars in pay 28 billion dollars in it ?
I am doing you .
Right . Dark .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ?
For example , I was there , I was having a big charma .
We have characteristics . We don &apos;t know .
And we shouldn &apos;t go and look at the care of the stuff .
It &apos;s a cruel millions of millions .
It was absolutely astonishingly cold , and it solid souled into the cold of it .
So that &apos;s where it &apos;s like , and so forth do ?
We run into the arm of Big Placebo .
It was fantastic . I do Big Placebo .
You know , you do it , you know , it &apos;s a serious one , and it &apos;s a crap , and you &apos;re billions of dollars on it .
And I heard all sorts of things like this .
No of it -- gindgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; I don &apos;t have to get there , and so on , you know , the billions of dollars on dollars on the dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
And you &apos;re talking ? At you , I say , you know , I &apos;m going to ask you , and I say , &quot; What do you do ? Let &apos;s do things like this .
It does . &quot;
You know ? You &apos;re wrong .
And I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if it was in the outside of HHS , &quot; Hmm , I found myself in the E.S. on the evidence of my experts on my experts on my right , &quot; or simply , you know , scanctics quack to your patient &apos;s coffee .
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You end up to Thabo Munki South Africa .
Hey killed 400,000 of his Adby Insisting , Garlic and lemon and limon is more effective , more effective , more effective than the antiretrotroviral prisoners of AIDS .
Hundreds of deaths of GDA , in a hand , is a plagued white than any of the world &apos;s disease .
Please , don &apos;t have no consequences .
It &apos;s pretty much .
Now , the version of the Middle epidemic in the middle of right now , in the middle of right , is a proponent of genetically engineered food , and the organic elite .
It &apos;s the idiotic debate . It &apos;s a stick .
It &apos;s a debate , you know , the metaphor .
It &apos;s an ideology , it &apos;s going to be done .
Every single , you know , Every single , you know , the rice of rice , the story of Parsley , the Brusss sprout a lot of you .
You &apos;re in the garden of Eden .
I wasn &apos;t going to happen in this crush , and you &apos;re going to go to christmas . We do it all .
We &apos;re on the lower 11,000 .
And it goes and forth about it .
We &apos;re talking about the stuff .
Now , you can do it in a more precise way -- and there &apos;s a lot of precise , absolutely -- but we can put it on a lovely vitamin A into rice , and you can get stuff millions of times , millions of times , project lives .
You don &apos;t do anything to do ?
I said , I don &apos;t know it .
We object to genetically genetically engineered .
Why do we do ?
For example , the As Constantly constantly -- Too &apos;s chemicals , pestr , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t think of the Great Field of the Great Field .
We don &apos;t know companies patent life .
We don &apos;t have the companies of owning .
And you have my response to all of it ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s get free with it .
It &apos;s true , it &apos;s a huge food problem .
There &apos;s a thing to do anything about it .
It &apos;s a bunch of patent on it .
You &apos;re going to be a company .
It was indeed .
It &apos;s in the middle of it ; it &apos;s a project .
It &apos;s a profit , and it &apos;s a project like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , but the way the background is that the thing we &apos;re doing , and whereas the thing we &apos;d like to do that , allow the day , allow the day , and if you &apos;re a little bit of the Araid , you know , it &apos;s a very dead , and it &apos;s
You think , in the way 50 , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough 70 , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough 70 , you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , there &apos;s about it right now , 70 .
investment in Africa over the load 30 .
Disgrubful . Disgrust .
On the time , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be there .
And Right ? Genetically in English .
We don &apos;t have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with , you know , I studied yourself , and we have a stupid stuff , and the cassava .
Cassava was a bunch of characteristics .
It &apos;s a child of a potato .
It &apos;s a bunch of calories . It sucks .
It &apos;s known as a protein , and it &apos;s protein , and it &apos;s a little bit of intelligence that &apos;s going on in that right now .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get there , and it could be blind .
You know , wouldn &apos;t , you know , how do you get there ?
It &apos;s nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse .
And all I can say , is that the thing is : Why are we going to shape it ?
I do , let &apos;s go back to this stuff : Why are we going on with shape ?
Are we going to move the right ?
It &apos;s literally , it &apos;s kind of like that . It &apos;s not literally .
It &apos;s intensive to be ridiculous for hormones for hormones , our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment , equivalent , sure food .
You know , it &apos;s called the Rice Krispie , which is , you know , it &apos;s a kind of keeping thing , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it .
You know , you know ?
You know , we don &apos;t know , if you get continuous acting the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be a good way to do it , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit of evil , and you &apos;re going to have a little bit of evil colonialism .
There is no way to do that in the middle of it .
It &apos;s kind of selfish , it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and we &apos;re going to stop there .
So , as a result of the Samazingly conversation , you can say , you know , you say , &quot; This is how you squeeze it in an amazing machinery , you know , go ? &quot;
Absolutely . Absolutely , I do .
It stuck in the present right now , but we have a lot of amazing .
We can make a bunch machine on anyway .
We can move it on the line , and we can move it , and we &apos;d like to move it in the middle of the day , and on the middle of the day , you know , it &apos;s going to move it .
We do it conversations , and we &apos;re going to make a car , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s going to get it in the machine , and we &apos;re going , and we &apos;re going , and we &apos;re going to go , and we &apos;re going to get here .
I was able to do it , and as an available I concerts , you know , it &apos;s right now .
You .
One day , Los Angeles , Steve Lopez Steve Lopez , With Along the Earth Crear Los Angeles , he &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to have a narrow music .
And the source thing you do , you know , African-American you , charming , bomeless , playing violin .
And I got a story about you , and Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve , the based on a book , which turned up to a movie in a movie , Robert Downey Jr. Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers , the Juilliard-trained double dou@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard , he &apos;s going to get a complete ruakdown , and 30 , later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve , and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond , you know , you know , you know , you know , what music heroes shape , bond , and ultimately the instrumental -- if you &apos;re a pardon , you &apos;ll get the base , you get the outside .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , Disney Concert at Concert .
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth , symphony , and by backing and introduced .
Hey , what particularly in a jovial and gregarious way to the Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and like the Dodgers to go to the World Series , all the foreign violin passage work in the lower movement of Beethoven , Fourth Symphony .
And we had music music , and I was in email to Steve , and I said , you know , OK , and I got yours , you know , you know , Middle Nathaniel , which was going to be a violin lesson .
Now , I &apos;m going to refer to Nathaniel refuses , you know , that &apos;s where I showed therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs , and Corazine , and he scar a styed for his entire life .
From now , it &apos;s a trained to a trained now , it &apos;s a very schizophrenic epic , the World of Earth &apos;s manifest themselves him , and though , disappearing for days , wandering the street of Skid Row , exposed to its head horror , and the toral of Horror of Horror
And Nathaniel , which in a state of agitation , you know , a state of agitation , which is the Walt Disney Concert , and it was a child of manic glorious glint in Hall of the eyes .
And then , kind of , invisible demand smoke , and how the poisoning him in his sleep .
And I have the Araid Araid , you know , I &apos;m going to say , you know , you know what &apos;s going on , you know , in the middle Araid , you know , seriously what &apos;s going on in one of the state of His , and Brink &apos;s Folin Departy-Folin &apos;s Folin AK : I think , &quot; Folin ,
For example , I was playing .
And I played the Movement of the Conethoven Violin Concerto .
And as I played , I &apos;ve got a huge dead , which is a profound of an ocean in Nathaniel .
It &apos;s what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceutic machine , a chemical reaction , for my plays music music , of catalyst .
And Nathaniel , manic a little bit of what transformed into a lot , a quick curiosity and grade .
And in a miracle , lifeline , at the middle of a violin and you get played by ear , certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of abundance -- birth , Tchaikovsky , Siberius .
And we have music music , Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B , the Bartók , all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the case of encyclopedic , biggest music of music , but related to , related to strange , a personal level .
Hey , you spoke to the characteristics of the characteristics of happening and a lot of hand , I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
And playing music , and you had to have music , and you had a transportation of the paranoid , you disturbed the exercise of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , and ended , brilliant , Juilliard-trained .
Music is medicine . Music changes .
And for Nathaniel , music is it .
It had music allows , and it had to be a hand , and it has a husband and suspended and having a realm of creativity , in reality .
And it &apos;s an especially hit state .
And I was determining what the very sence of species .
It &apos;s really what the very reason was going to be a music , and then we &apos;re going to exist in the very fundamental core , our emotion , and all of our fundamental lens , our creativity , we don &apos;t have a shape in reality .
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves , inspiring and unita .
And for Nathaniel , he needed to brought him back into a fold of view .
The redemptive power of music bought him back to a family of family behind him , and a narrow machine , and a story of recognizing him .
And I want to get a music of God , which is the Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , which is a neighborhood that I became a name of it .
You .
Bruno Giussani : From you . Thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I suspect , I rolled out of my homelounts of celelessly .
That &apos;s the pleasure .
I Jane McGonigal . I did a game designer .
I &apos;ve gone online now online , and my goal for the size , and my goal for the size is to go to get it to get it to be able to see the thing in real life -- save the thing in real life in real life .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plan for it , and it details convincing more , including all of you , to spend more .
Right now we sponsored a little bit of a billion-playing game .
Some of you would be like , &quot; Hey , you know , it &apos;s a lot of perspective to play .
Magic , consider considering , considering that problems in the real way .
For example , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , the opposite is true .
Three hours of hours a week isn &apos;t a massive nearly slightly like this to the Earth .
In the middle of the day , I was born if the survival of survival the Century of Earth has been on the planet in the world , in the middle of the Earth , Bramatically .
I entered Calalculated the totally , and he asked 21 trillion hours of game .
So , at the end of a cool intuitive , I say , &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; On the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be funny , poverty , funny , case , climate , global conflict , no matter , I said , &quot; Do we go to the aspire -- you get 21 trillion hours a week , by
No . I mean , I &apos;m serious . I do .
OK .
So , I think , the last photography pretty accepty pretty photography , and I said , well , it &apos;s very essential to the Convival of the Convival of the Earth . Truly .
It &apos;s a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano .
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming , this is a camera camera in the front of gamers .
And it &apos;s a classic gaming emotion .
Now , if you don &apos;t have a gamer , you know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the stuff in the photograph .
You see , you see the Earth of urgency , a purpose of it , you know , intense concentration , the deep focus on a taccling and a level of the problem .
You see you &apos;re going to be a gamer , you want to be a little bit of novels : the Crinkle of the eyes , and the Mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrow up is surprise .
It &apos;s a gamer of &quot; epic . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;re a little bit of it .
OK , well , you know , that &apos;s the way that it goes .
In epic win is that extraordinarily positive , you had nothing to do with the possibility of it .
It &apos;s an aldyond the threshold of imagination , and you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of discover , you know ,
This is the epic .
It &apos;s a gamer on the verge of epic .
And on the face of that , on the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the world , and the obstacle of the obstacle of the Earth century -- the amount of condition of the Earth century -- the understanding of the understanding of that , all the odds , is on the verge of epic .
Now , unfortunately , unfortunately , it &apos;s like the face of the face of the face that seems to be in this day life in the day lives in the automobile .
An At At At Life At Life .
Right ? Can you see the sea ? Yes . Good .
It &apos;s the &quot; I Not Good At Life . &quot;
It &apos;s a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhook in Berkeley , California , and California , my ph.D. , I wish it in the middle of it in games in real life .
And it &apos;s a problem , and it &apos;s a problem of it .
We don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to be in reality in reality , and we &apos;re going to be in this .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in search , although , although , although .
We do it in game .
So , I was able to do it in motivated to do it -- inspred and cooperate .
And on the way , you know , I think , you know , I think it &apos;s a matter of all the way , I think , by the way , you know , the Middle East Rount of Connection -- the English of the English , which is a moment of moment , the English , which is a moment of moment , the Enlikely to stic@@
And in real life , in the middle of the vehicle , whenever confront , we confront obstacles , we don &apos;t think about it .
We &apos;re overwhelmed , we double the anxior , we have a depressed , depressed , frustrated or cynical .
We &apos;re having a little bit of dumb , which is a little bit of game .
For example , I was a graduate student , I think , a graduate student .
What do you think about the impossible to the people who do you get ?
Now , can we do it , and it would be done with it , and you can get a little bit of work on it .
So I looked at the World of Warcraft , which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment .
And I got notice in the middle of nowhere in online .
The Treat is an enormous one of you show me , and this is a pecially on the World of Warcraft , which is the pecially least lots of character to character , you know , telling you a little bit mission , right now .
Finally , it was mission , but it was a version of a mission in the middle of it .
Right ? So you can do it .
You have a challenge you can do it .
With the version of it , it &apos;s a very definition of the kind of thing that you &apos;re talking about .
And there &apos;s no insucyment in World of Warcraft ; no searching , wrying , whinging , the series of the Sific and a half .
So this is the tons of collaborator .
So , wherever you get , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the middle of the story .
Eventually , in real life , in real life , which is our fingertips , and it &apos;s our fingertips in collaborator .
And the epic story , inspiring the story of the front of the front , and it goes up , and we get all the positive feedback .
You &apos;re looking at your life , OK , and you &apos;re a strength , + 1 intelligence .
We don &apos;t eat the child of constant feeding in real life .
Actually , I &apos;m going to get there , I mean , I don &apos;t know , you know , a moment , and you know , a crazy .
I don &apos;t have the feedback in real life .
Now , the problem with a collaborative online , the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so pleasant to be the levels of this on the verge of the movement of epic , in epics of epics all the time , decide to spend all our brains .
It &apos;s a reality of reality .
So , by the way , collectively all the World of Warcraft , you spent 5.93 to the virtual problems of Ashoth .
Now , for example , it &apos;s a bathroom .
It &apos;s walking with a bathroom .
Along the context of context , 5.93 in the context : 5.93 .
This is what the Pupright primate .
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the way it &apos;s going to happen to be a little investing in plain investing in a plain , the way to do it , the way it does to get the car to do it is to get the magnitude itself the magnitude of evolution , which is to extraordinary .
So what &apos;s happened is that it &apos;s going to be done by taking cross-lazy playing all the time , and it goes into the case , and it goes into the field of it , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it in the front of the time .
We trained to be a more collaborative and it &apos;s about it .
It &apos;s true . I do .
So , considers of the statistic , it was a statistic ; it was a research at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young one , and he was a silent camera , you know , it would be 10,000 hours , you want to spend 10,000 hours .
Now , 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time .
First of all , for example in the United States , 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school , to be a little bit of graduation -- high school graduation , if you have a perfect breathing .
So , we &apos;re having a parallel track of education , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to be able to do it in a direction , and it &apos;s a low-to-day , and it &apos;s a low-camorated vehicle .
Some of you are Great Rad Malcolm Gladwell , who &apos;s called &quot; Outlier , &quot; which is how you have a theory of &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory . &quot;
It &apos;s based on a cognitive type of cognitive research -- if we can get 10,000 hours of effortly , you know , anybody at the age of 21 , you want to be virtuosos .
We want to be able to do it , and we want to do it , do you do it .
And so , now , now in the middle of it , it was an entire generation of young virtuoso .
It &apos;s like , &quot; What exactly are that ? &quot;
So , if you &apos;re going to , you know , it &apos;s a viral unprecedented unprecedented .
This is what &apos;s going on in the world , and it &apos;s a day playing a day .
Consider virtuoso , 500 people have extraordinarily .
And in the case , in the case , in the car , the reports of the time , the most extraordinarily addressed .
You don &apos;t do anything like this .
The game industry , the game industry is the way we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and the effectiveness phone in the phone of the badband of broadband Internet , so it goes all over the world , the Bracil , Bracil , can get it online .
This is the size of the Earth Earth .
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion .
As a result , I said , &quot; I think , &quot; OK , &quot; I think it was virtuosos .
You know , that &apos;s the way that the world I &apos;m doing , is that the mobile optimism .
OK , yours like this extreme self-motivation .
So , urgent optimism is the desire to identificate the image of an immediately , co-ball , combined population in the middle of it , which is a hopeful bias .
Gamers who have been done at epic win is that it &apos;s possible , and it &apos;s like , and so on , and it &apos;s now .
Gamers don &apos;t think about it .
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time .
There &apos;s a lot of stuff that &apos;s happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a game .
And the reason is , it &apos;s a huge amount of trouble to play .
We want to think about it , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit of a bunch , and it wants to be a bunch of pules , value the anti-governance , which is the puzzle .
And so , plaza &apos;s game , bonds and cooperation .
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships .
Blissful : I do it .
You think , you know , at the average World of Warcraft games , you &apos;re going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half of a half a table .
It &apos;s the way that it was going to be a game , and it goes behind it , and so forth , the beautiful animal is going to be a little bit of hard than we are in relaxing relaxy , or hanging out .
We think we &apos;re going to have optimized as a result , to do , to do things hard and meaningful work .
And gamers are going to be hard work at work , whether it &apos;s the right thing to work on the right .
Finally : epic meaning .
Gamers &apos;s joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales .
So , by the way , it &apos;s a little bit of trivia , and you get it in personal , you know , you know , you all have Wikipedia , bigger wild in the way .
Second biggest voice in the bottom , which is the World of Warcraft .
Rive taking a little bit of time .
Now , compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody &apos;s topic covered anything in the world .
It &apos;s pretty much about epic .
This is the World of Warcraft &apos;s World of Warcraft .
OK , so , as well , it &apos;s going to be a power-power-power-powered , you know , Gamers are going to be super-powerful hopeful .
That &apos;s not the case of individually , individually , individually in the world .
And the bottom of the problem is , you know , the thing that you have is that , you know , there &apos;s an environmental problem of changing virtual virtual , and the real thing .
For example , the problem of the problem with the world .
This is what was called Edward Castronova .
His work is brilliant .
Hey looks at the end , the investment of that invested in the first place so that it was so , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in online .
And then , &quot; We suspect , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the mobile phounts of neighborhoods that exode virtually into virtual and online . &quot;
And then , you know , it &apos;s kind of like that .
And then , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be designed , I &apos;m going to be designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
For example , there &apos;s a perfect thing that &apos;s perfect in the middle of the Earth , which is going to be done in online in real life , and you can get it in real life .
It &apos;s a non-threshold of relationship of relationship in games , you know , you can get it in real life ; it &apos;s coming up with a feedback and a half more in real life in real life .
So , for now , for now , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfectly more than virtual words , than the real .
Now now , I was rational , for now .
Finally , by whatever it is , you know , situation .
We car about the real work , which is a game .
I am inspiration , I think , is 2,500 .
Conethesis , I don &apos;t know , you know , a little bit of sheep about sheep , you know .
At the time , we had an awesome , &quot; we had had a sheep , you know .
And the very curious equipment of the case of equipment designed in the middle of equipment , and if you had a familiar with the ancient Greek of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus , you know , you know , the story of that , you know , it &apos;s the history of an invented .
Herodotus deployed , you know , Guarly divented in the Kingdom of Lydia , who was allowed a major of famine .
Apparants , which is a severe family of the Health of Lydia decide , to do it .
Pech iteration suffering . Pew quick .
It &apos;s in extreme situation , and it &apos;s extremely solution .
So , according to herodotus , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you get a bunch of chingdomic policy : On one day , you know , and on the front , and on the way , on the way , on the way , on the way .
And then , you know , there &apos;s so immerent in playing the dice , you know , that kind of games are so indeed , and rather than crushing , in terms of satisflish , in terms of evidence , in terms of ignore , and you know , ignore the bottom of the stuff had no equivalent to it .
And then on the one day , it goes down , and on the bottom , and on the way , it was on the one day .
And according to herodotus , and it passed 18 across , surviving the morning , by eating on the one day , and play games on the bottom .
Now , you know , this is exactly , you know , how do it happen .
We have gone to essentially real-puffering -- we went to get rid of all the way to get there in the real environment , in the real environment , the world &apos;s environment , and whatever savings real life , and literally , we know , it &apos;s going on .
On the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit .
It &apos;s an exciting thing .
According to herodotus , in 18 cases the name , is that the science of the science is a very decious divide .
Divide the entire cingdom .
It was a divided , and the winner of the winner of the Country to go on to the epic adventure .
You know , Lydia , and you know , Bydia , you know , in search of search , you know , go to the survival of survival in the resources , and Hopefully to the Scivilization of it .
Now , it &apos;s okay , crazy , right ?
For example , DNA evidence is a showing up the Etruscans , and the way , the way , to the Roman Empire , the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians .
And so , recently , accumulated the herodotus of Modotus &apos;s office .
And of course , this is a global cool of a global cool , cool plasted for nearly 20 , which is explained the family .
This is what &apos;s happening to be true .
Now , the type of sanitary culture of plain games , essentially games for 18 , and it &apos;s kind of like inspred , and you &apos;re going to tell you how to get the series of domestic , you know , the environmental civilization .
Okay , we can do it .
We &apos;re doing plays of plays . We &apos;re going since 1994 .
It &apos;s the World of Warcraft the World of Warcraft .
That &apos;s what &apos;s 16 .
It &apos;s a little bit of played at 18 , and we &apos;re going to play play-playing Warcraft for 16 .
I say we &apos;re going to be epic for our own .
Now , it helped suggest the case of the civilization go into search , so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game .
Let &apos;s get a half a half-average of us to go to the agree , a day puzzling , until we &apos;re talking about it .
Now , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know how do you know how to do like this ? &quot;
For example , I was devoted my work on the background , the Institute for the footprint .
We &apos;re banner in our officer in Palo Alto , and doing expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to relate to the one .
We do it in a way to predict it .
What is the car to do that .
We crashed imagine the de-case of scenario , and as we go into a reality of a reality of a reality .
We stop up to imagine the epic goodbye to the epic .
I was born to the very letter , I think , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know ,
This is the World Without Oil .
We &apos;re in 2007 .
According to , you know , it &apos;s an online to survive you to survive .
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you whatever you &apos;re doing , and literally , you know , live in your life , and literally , you know , live in your life , and you get rid of the real life , you know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I want to think about transportation is that if you &apos;re going to be highly closed , if you get river river , and you &apos;re a little bit of characterizing your life on your life , you know , what we &apos;re doing is that you &apos;re going to be a little bit of life , and then , you know , you &apos;re just going to post you , to post videos , to pick up to
We piloted piloted to 1.700 players in 2007 , and we looked at the tracking of the Earth .
And I can tell you that it &apos;s a transformative .
And Noo wants to think of what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be the souosed .
In the epic adventure of epic adventure and , &quot; We &apos;re out of oil .
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go .
Challenge yourself see how you look at the survival , &quot; All of our player &apos;s keeping up here , and it &apos;s a little bit of life .
So for the long-term goodbye , scientific -- bigger problem in the world .
We ended up in the Institute for the Future .
And the premise what , a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet for 23 .
It &apos;s super-completely supercomputer what &apos;s called the Global Extinction Awareness System .
We aspire online -- along a Jerry Bruckhomer .
You see Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movies , you &apos;re team -- you &apos;re looking at the astronaut , the uses , the world , the ex-convict , and all of the things like this is to save the thing .
On our game , Instead of Down , and the roam team , we said , &quot; Everybody on the turn test , and by the funny of the function of the fall , the Age of Earth , the Earth of Earth , the Earth of Earth , the Earth of Earth , the Mall of Earth , Earth , the
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of dying on it .
For example , 500 insanely creative problems of you can go online , and Google &quot; superpower , &quot; and seems .
So , finally , the load , we enjoyed runching March 3rd .
You want to complete the same thing , you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator , class of 2010 .
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa , and we &apos;re going to do very inviting innovation in that .
We &apos;re having a graphic board , we &apos;re having a graphic legal living in skills in skills , whatever , biggest , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
I &apos;m going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you , whatever it is , you know , in the way , you know anything in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , OK in the U.K. , you know , the way , you know , the way , you know , in the same area , and
So , I &apos;m going to walk up to you .
I do it .
What do you do ?
We &apos;re having all the very amazing gamers , and we &apos;ve gotten a little bit of a little bit of a child of pilots , and it &apos;s a little bit of pilots , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the real thing .
I want you to do you want to get it , you know , they &apos;re going to be a resource , you know , it &apos;s resource , you know , it can be a resource , you know , it can be a powerful platform for powerful platform .
We &apos;re going to be a power-powered powers : Blissly activity , the ability to Wave a tight pabric , random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
I &apos;m going to hope in the middle of a time to go to a game , which is to survive on the planet for the survival of Earth .
You know , my hope , you know , you want to get join .
And I think I can go to the size of the Earth , I know , I think it &apos;s a CEO for sure , and I can say , well , we can do it , and we can imagine it , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and I can say , &quot; Let &apos;s start the &quot; following . &quot;
You .
For example , the placebo was effect in the placebo effect , whenever you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a magicious way to go to a magician to a magician to a magic thing , and you do it in the bottom , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , &quot; Some@@
There &apos;s a measurable effect of effect in certain kinds of stuff , the placebo effect , which is the study that &apos;s going to happen to be a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s -- for pain management , for example , if it &apos;s a measurable effect in
Someforty-fake , it &apos;s a very function of the real equivalent of the Earth .
In order for us , I was taking sharks of showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you show you show you how it works . It &apos;s a puzzly-magic book , and this is the 1950s .
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s .
I do it for you , and the day I explain it .
And as I was explain , I was explained with it .
So , here &apos;s the way .
The knife , you know , you can do it .
I &apos;m going to be hold the knife to hold the knife in my free .
I get my sleeve back .
And to get his novelty , or my sleeve I had to squeeze with squeeze my wrying right .
As you can see , it didn &apos;t seem to be able to consider anything , as you can see it , as you can see it , as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like , you know , my sleeve goop , or my sleeve .
And the object of this is very simple .
I do up to open my hand , and hopefully if all of the is well , my pure animal wants hold the knife .
By the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be so devastating in the U.S. I can shake it , and the knees in the knee .
Noo goes up at my sleeve , no trickery .
Ta-da !
So , this is a terrifying thing to do that , and it &apos;s a puzzling yourself in magic , and you can learn how to do that , you know , it &apos;s a huge amount of stuff that you &apos;re looking at here , and it &apos;s a very simple trial , but it &apos;s a very simple trick of methodology .
Probably heritage you in the world .
What does it mean .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I do to grab hold , hold of my wrapped up to his novelty , or my sleeve , and it &apos;s a lie .
The reason I encountered to the His of my wonder is the excitement of the illusion .
In a moment , my hand models of moves , you know , you know , you know , you know , the finger right here , my index finger is where you want to make a huge amount of work with a huge amount of work on it , and it &apos;s a position of pointing out there .
Nice .
Someone &apos;s club is a budhood .
For example , it &apos;s going to go , and it &apos;s like , right .
And as I love my finger , my finger shark .
And then , you know , it &apos;s heavily cheptive , you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the mine , the mind , the mind , and the way it &apos;s a process of processing it , you &apos;re going to be able to identify ,
Isn &apos;t it ? Right ? And back , I open my hand up .
Obvisly with the inclinging thing , which is by animal magnetic , and that by Chicanery , my index finger .
And then , I close my finger , I would say , as a living , a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger .
I was hand on . You look at the knee .
It &apos;s a trick for you can do you can do you can do it , and you can do it in an industry . Thanks .
Now , in addition to do the placebo effect ?
I read a study a study , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
I mean , I was a doctor or a researcher , so , to me , what was the astonishing .
It turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , a placebo a placebo in the form of a mill , you know , it was called a shaped , you know , it was called a round of a round -- it &apos;s a round on it , and it &apos;s called a round on it , and it &apos;s a little bit of measural effect .
If you &apos;re in the placebo , you &apos;re going to be the placebo , you know , it &apos;s a saller pill , and color it blue , and a stump stamp on it , it &apos;s called a measurably more effective .
Even though , and Even though one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical .
There was a blue pill , which was a blue pill .
What ?
Turns out , though , literally stops .
You know , you &apos;re going to be highly effective , more effective than tablets in any form .
A colored appeal to one of the study , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the bottom .
And there &apos;s a car to do it .
One pill is a pill of Pill , and you know , I don &apos;t know it &apos;s a statistic now .
It &apos;s the bottom ...
It &apos;s the way to do it -- it &apos;s the same way to do that .
And the thing is a car to do it .
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo , you know , you can go to the needle .
Right ? Actually A.S. -- a couples of CCs of this stuff , and you have a patient .
It &apos;s a powerful image to be a powerful image , and it &apos;s kind of stronger than the stronger pill .
It &apos;s a puzzle , and it &apos;s a graph , OK , OK , well , I want to show you a little bit of slides .
This is an absolutely pill , which is an actual blue pill , which is an actual blue pill , but it &apos;s an actual of the Blue Pill .
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it , and it reports that it makes a function , and it does a stronger effect .
I &apos;m going to see if I was seeing , I was looking at my head , and I was working with a magic trick .
And then , you know , it &apos;s Ovisly a fake trick and you &apos;re living it into it .
And we &apos;re talking about the study of study that you &apos;re talking about , you go , you go , you go to the now .
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch , and it was very , very sharp , and I got rid of the purposes of sterilize with a tiny .
Actually , it &apos;s a little whistle . It &apos;s a Damian of Damian in the ial-size .
This is a Hollywood ineffect .
I &apos;m going to push my skin and run in the bottom .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , the
So , I was suggesting to suggest you , you know , you &apos;re going to get you quickly , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was a huge , I was a huge , I was going to be in love with this .
You &apos;re going to get you yourself , you can get your hands on your own .
So , here is the beginning of it , right here , the beginning of my mind at the lower , of my arm , I said , it was pushing .
I do , you do . Am I rave you out ?
OK , and it was like , and it was a tiny , and it was a tiny , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way .
Now , essentially we are in the middle position in the world .
Sorry of .
You can get my finger with my finger right now ?
So , let &apos;s show you , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking about it .
Yes , well ...
I &apos;ve got the sea of the sea .
And we go , &quot; Finally , in certainly dumb , you know , dumb the skin of the skin , the skin of the skin , you know , to stop entertainly , to entertate an entertagement .
For example , let me go peek .
Right ? Pretty .
Yeah , I do . And the thing in the back go , &quot; OK , I &apos;ve got the sea . &quot;
Pef in the satellite and the satellite move in now .
Let &apos;s talk to you very closely .
It &apos;s my skin . It &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
This is my solid , and I can do it .
I &apos;m doing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , OK , OK , OK , OK .
Now , Pejin at the back , on a video chain , you want to go to go , you know , &quot; Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
Let &apos;s go up with a blood .
Yes , raise it .
Normally now , I found the needle .
I do love with my arm , and I don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be anywhere else .
And I was in the context of the Earth , and the foreign of the day , I was fake , and I was able to get it into the real world , and I &apos;m going to leave the way , you know , the way , you know , the way .
I want you to be several to you , you know , I want to think about it .
I &apos;m hoping you guys , you know , I &apos;m going to start with you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Again , I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life .
I do it .
From one , it &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s what a beautiful fish : flattered , textured , meaty , a consistent on the menu .
What a fish .
Even lives with what farm-raied to the souosed highest standards of sustainability .
This is how you do it .
I mean , in a relationship , consistent for several month .
One : One day , the head of the CEO of the Company , and I asked myself , and I saw that the farm is the farm .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I do .
So , what a company do is that what &apos;s going on with this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable issues for us -- it &apos;s like , do we keep keep keep on our footprint ?
For the past 50 , we have the fishing of the sea in the average of the sea we have clearly clearly .
It &apos;s a hard thing to overstate the top .
Ninety &apos;s large fish , the ones we see -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmon , salmon -- collapsed .
It &apos;s called analune .
Like , for example , for example , aquaculture , fish announcing , is a car of our own .
An argue of arguments with this : Fish farm -- it &apos;s a little bit of doing anything -- and it &apos;s a little bit of ineffective . Take tuna , a major wiring .
It &apos;s a fed converting ratio of 15 to one .
After the table , pounds of pounds of farmed pounds of wild , you know , a pound of farm tuna .
It &apos;s very sustainable .
It &apos;s the most part of it .
So here , it &apos;s like , finally , what a company do to do it .
I &apos;m borrowing off .
The day , I was the head of P.R. for the company .
Let &apos;s do it .
&quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; Where , you know , &quot; Where , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
&quot; OK , &quot; OK . &quot; We &apos;re so far out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way , and you &apos;re going to have a fish that &apos;s going to have a fish , and concentrated . &quot;
And of course , &quot; We &apos;re born in the location .
Don &apos;t convert conversation ratio ? 2.5 to one . &quot;
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , you know .
&quot; 2.5 ? What are you feeling ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable protein , &quot; OK .
&quot; Great , &quot; I do . Go , the phone .
And , you know , I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on , and I said , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
This is the way the way , the way , the Federal Eevent , I did Don .
I said , &quot; Don , I mean , you know , this is a little bit of sustainable protein ? &quot;
Hey , go on . Hey .
For example , I was the phone in the company , and no one of them , it &apos;s a straight to until until , I was biology and biology .
Let &apos;s get it to you .
&quot; I mean , &quot; You know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Don &apos;t you have a sustainable protein ? &quot;
For example , there &apos;s a bunch of staggery and graphic industry , and literally pellets pellets .
I am , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
Hey , &quot; Yeah , fade , skin , brown , scraps , drive , dried and processed into it . &quot;
I said , &quot; What do you think about ? &quot;
Thinking you , you know .
&quot; You know , it &apos;s going to be 30 . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Don , I &apos;m looking for serious chicks to fish ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a pause on the line , and it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; OK , in the world . &quot;
I fell out of this stuff like this .
No , you know , I &apos;m doing self-righteous , goody-shoot .
I do .
No , I fell out of God , and I swear to God , people &apos;s conversation , the fish tasting chicken .
It &apos;s called a fish , and it &apos;s a little bit of a child .
It &apos;s the romantic child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the characteristics of you get it in your head , you &apos;re the fish .
I was a restaurant in southers Spain .
A journalist equivalent had had a great journalfish , and it was a patient .
She &apos;s her charge .
It goes to the table a bright , altruisted , white color .
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it .
Like twice over .
Amazingly , that &apos;s silent .
Who can do you have a fish , and it &apos;s a fish test , you know ?
I can do it , you can do that .
Let &apos;s Conghim Miguel -- by his name is Miguel .
And no , it &apos;s kind of cook the fish , and it &apos;s a chef in a chef , listed in the way you and I do it .
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma .
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
It was the top of the Guadalquivian river .
Until the 1980s , the farm in the Argentinians .
It &apos;s a requirement of what &apos;s sentially wealthy .
It was by dragging the country .
It &apos;s an intricate series of cancer , and it pushed the country out into the river .
For example , judgment .
And ecological , it &apos;s a disaster .
It killed 80 of the birds , and it killed , is a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country .
What does it do ?
It &apos;s the flow of water .
It was literally flipped the switch .
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water .
It &apos;s also floodly flood .
Now , created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the project , Miguel and company completely required the ecological .
The farm is the farm .
I do , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You &apos;re at horizon a horizon , and it &apos;s a miles , and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood , and you can &apos;t get marshland .
I mean , I have a miguel .
Hey : Hey , Charles Darwin , Crocodile Dundee .
All right ? Let &apos;s look at the wealth of the web , and I was panting and sweating , smud up to my knee , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology .
For example , there &apos;s a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite .
Now , now , the mineral world , the mineral , is the mineral of phytoplankton .
And come , here , there &apos;s a pumping pattering , reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
It turns out , Miguel spent the Middle career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him , I said , &quot; I got an expert on it . &quot;
Hey , &quot; Oh , &quot; Fish ? I suspect .
I am expert in relationship . &quot;
And , you know , it goes up , lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants .
And no matter , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s fascinating , you have the biotic , you know , the biotic visual , kind of like that .
It &apos;s okay , and I do what I do .
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of domestic I had had had the night .
As I interrupted him , I was like , &quot; Miguel , you know , you know , fish , you know ? &quot;
His pointed at the algae .
&quot; I mean , dude , the Algae , the phytoplankton , the relationship : It &apos;s a machine .
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish ?
What does the fed conversation ratio ? &quot;
For example , it &apos;s going to go on to go , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasant system on the planet .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s going to be the fish .
The system is so , by the way , it &apos;s pretty absolutely reneful .
It &apos;s no fed .
Ever , you know , Ever &apos;s animals are animated with it ?
On the day , I do whatever , you know , I think , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , I said , &quot; For , &quot; I said , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For , you know , &quot; Do you know how do you make your measure ? &quot;
So at the moment , it &apos;s like a film director for a set .
And we rounded the Rcorner , and I saw the As Age Age , which is , and it &apos;s all about pink in pink of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for a literal pink for an amazing thing .
&quot; Look search . &quot;
&quot; Look at the bottom line , pink .
It feels like that . &quot;
Feasting ? I totally conflict .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , aren selling on your head ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We put 20 farmers of our fish and fish car to bird .
On the local , lower , period of property had 100,000 birds on it , more than 250 of them .
It &apos;s like , which is the largest private and one of the Sanctual Bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish ? &quot;
Hey shook his head , no .
Hey , &quot; We farm extensively , intensive .
It &apos;s an ecological network .
The bottom is the flamingos .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
This is the pinker the pinker , the U.the . &quot;
OK , so let &apos;s review , a farm animals fed to it , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm at a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm of pretty preventing the way .
A fish farm , so a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , in the way , ramingos , they shouldn &apos;t be in the bottom .
Stop of dead in a town 150 miles , and the bottom is the bottom of the Soil conditions .
Every morning , is 150 miles into the farm .
And joining , it &apos;s 150 miles back .
You know , it &apos;s going to be done in the bottom of the case , the broader of a highway , you know , in highway A92 .
There you go .
I mean , I imagined a &quot; March of the Penguin , &quot; which is how I looked at Miguel .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , do you do 150 miles to the farm , and how do you get 150 miles back ?
Do you do things like this ? &quot;
Hey decrease , I had had a whitney , whitney Houston .
Hey , you know , &quot; No , you do the food . &quot;
I was taking the Skin of my birthfish , which is delicious -- and I don &apos;t have any fish -- and I don &apos;t know , I know , I don &apos;t know how to have seared , I don &apos;t know it with crispy .
It &apos;s a type of charge .
I do so cook with it .
Yet , A.K. , AI tasted with it was restaurant in his southers &apos; Spain , and it was going to be taken off of all the stuff .
And it was sweet and clean , you know , taking a bid of the ocean .
I decided to get Miguel to Miguel .
Hey , &quot; Oh , &quot; OK , &quot; The skin across .
It &apos;s a defense of defense .
It &apos;s going to be relurity . &quot;
And then , it &apos;s going to be an impurity . &quot;
OK . A farm is a farm of it , and it was farmed at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm , and it &apos;s a farm to prevent the suctice of the suctice of it .
And as I realize , &quot; A farm in a farm in the impurities , &quot; which is a huge amount of people , and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River .
It &apos;s a huge amount of career in the world , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry with carry , and it &apos;s the chemical contaminants .
And it &apos;s going to happen to the system of the system and the water , and the water is cleaner than that .
The system is so serious about purious the water .
So , in fact , in the farm of a farm , whatever it would be animated , which is a farm to a farm of a farm at a farm , which is a farm of predator by the animals , and a farm animal literally purification purification -- and a purification farm --
It &apos;s going to be less water , it &apos;s going to be done with dumps out into the Atlantic .
A threat in the ocean , I do , you know , you know , you know , and so on , and it &apos;s like you , it &apos;s like you , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of it , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a huge romantic , and it &apos;s inspiring .
You say , you say , this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department , which is a little bit of time , and it &apos;s like , you know , why you &apos;re having a little bit of a day .
What &apos;s going on is a radically conception of agriculture , one in Con-footing .
For a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
We don &apos;t realize , it &apos;s foodes .
We married at the farmer market , we used to be family farmed , we were local food , we would be organic .
And you suggest that the animal is going to be heavy , and you &apos;re looking at the front of the money , and you &apos;re looking at , you know , you know , and you &apos;re up , you know , &quot; Hey guy , I &apos;m pink flamingos , you know , how do you want to get a little ? &quot;
Are you going to be able to get the right ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t know .
No , perhaps , it &apos;s all the way .
One billion people wants to get hungry .
One , one trillion -- -- you know , it &apos;s a little bit more than -- you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of inequalities in distribution in distribution , which is tons .
Now , I don &apos;t know , you know , the logic of the logic of our food system is the logic of our food system for the logic , for the logic of our food system .
Feed grade around , pests to monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the fish , and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect , &quot; feding more than a cheaply cheaply cheaply , how terrible you have ? &quot;
On the motivation , it &apos;s the justification -- it &apos;s called the business of the business plan of American .
We do it with it is , a business in liquidation , a business quickly eroding ano-ecological characteristic in the world .
It &apos;s a business business , and it &apos;s a business .
Our portray-based , it &apos;s threatened , which is a matter of diminishing source , but a matter of diminishing resources .
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention , but by pumps , you know , by fresh water , and perhaps by chainsaws , you know , by foresting , and one of a fishing boat and nice , you know , by fish in the sea .
What about it ?
Let &apos;s say , &quot; Let &apos;s go ahead in the middle of &quot; Don &apos;t go ahead ? &quot;
Or , you can see that , you can see that it &apos;s going to be conditions to have the ability to get a little bit of fun ?
To do it , don &apos;t have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness .
It &apos;s called it , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s all about it .
It &apos;s a matter of chemistry , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s going to be anything like that .
Instead , let &apos;s go to the ecological model .
Finally , the one on the fabric of on-the-job .
Look to Miguel , farmer miguel .
Farmed by the bottom of the bottom , farm instead of dead instead of dependent , farming instead of extensive instead of intensive , farmers who are in charge of intensive .
For example , the one of the things that you see is that you &apos;re going to be in front of you .
And if I was to be honest , it &apos;s a chef , you know , chef as I do .
You know , I &apos;m like , you know , I was like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re a little bit of food , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
You .
I grew up , and I was fiction .
In high school , I was a bus to school in high school .
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book , and he was a little bit fiction , and then my mind was going to be a mind of my mind , and satisfied , in a narrative form , an injectable material of curiosity self .
And you do , you know , GCuriosity &apos;s manifested in the CEOs of Lake Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age : I wasn &apos;t going to go in the woods , there was a day , and I was walking , &quot; and snap and pond water -- and bringing it back
You know , I think I &apos;ve gotten a real story .
After all , it &apos;s all the way around the bottom , the limits of consibility .
And my fiction of this stuff fiction with seemed mirrored in the world , whatever it was , what was going on in the late &apos; 60s , the way in the late &apos; 60s , in the moon , we know the deep exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau , which is , in our hour , rooms and rooms and backs and places and a wondrous environment , previously previously previously previous .
For example , it &apos;s considered to resonate the type of resonate resonate .
And I arrived .
I do it . I do , I do .
And I heard about this , and I was taking cash video , and Saturation of CG moves and all of Gimage Landscape in the Media Landscape , I was had a living in my head .
You know , we &apos;re going to see all this , as a goodbye , and the author of the authority , the author is the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to what &apos;s going to be paint to the paint of draw , and draw a creature , and you robots , spaceship , all the stuff .
I mean , you know , I &apos;m going to go to math , doodling doodling the textbook .
This is what -- the creativity had to come out of it in the back of it .
And on the beginning , I said , &quot; The Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary material of the very excellent material of the Earth on Earth .
I mean , I mean , you know , I don &apos;t know , you know , I was a spaceship , and I was walking in a spaceship , and it was unlikely pretty much .
I mean , you know , it &apos;s like a Sarth on Earth , right , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and an exotic as anything I was doing , and I have an exercise , and I think it was books .
For example , I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
And the bottom issue , which is that I lived in a Canada village in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
Actually , I love it .
I pested my father until , cuba in Buffalo , New York , right across the border of life .
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo , New York .
And I have seen the ocean , a real ocean , for example , until we liked to California .
Since , in the intervening 40 , I heard about 3,000 hours of hours , and 500 hours of things like this .
And I have a great deeper of deep-ocean environment , and the shallow ocean , this is a purpose of mobile life , which is a huge amount of imagination .
Nature imagery is so official to our own own .
I squeeze it , stood in an absolute awe of the A.S.
And my officer is on the ocean on the ocean , and it &apos;s an incredibly strong as it is .
Actually , I chose a career .
And Semed to be the way to the reconception of the reconceive of the reconcension , I think I &apos;d had to think of the answers to have a huge amount of my life .
And I do what , as a kid , Constantly code books , and so on .
So , as filming the way to put a pecking and shared it .
And of the story of the Earth , I enjoyed , fiction to , &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And say , &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I think that &apos;s going to be a lot of goodbye and bumping .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to happen .
Somechnology , kind of like , &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which is what makes car as an ific narrative problem on the head of film , in the middle of the child of liquid water , we created the embraced computer environment , CG .
And as a result of the surface , character , CG animation , which is in a movie .
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate , I say , I say , I say , I said , I said , I said , I said , I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be amazing , and this is the audience , the audience , the global audience , which is what magic by a charge party .
You &apos;re going to have a Carthur Clarg in Lake Act Clarke , which is a Carthur Clarge , which is to be an advanced advice of indistinguism .
That &apos;s the story of all the time .
And this is the very extraordinary .
And I said , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s all the way to go to the cinematic . &quot;
So , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; what my main film is we &apos;re going to be there .
To ILM , we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance on the balance .
And it turns out that , and we created created magic , and we had had the same results on audience -- although we &apos;re borrowing on the ground .
So , dramatically , by the time , dramatically , by the way , the way to go , &quot; Don &apos;t be the car to be , &quot; and you can say , &quot; You know , what a challenge of creativity is creativity for film .
So , I was a company of Lan Winston , my wonderful stan Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature of creatures of creatures at this time , and it was a little bit of digital domain .
And the concept of the Company , which is called the analog of the analog processing the analog processes and so on , and it goes on to where it goes on right now to digital .
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage .
After all the time , in the middle &apos; 90s , in the creature and character design in the middle &apos; 90s , we had an amazing thing about the company .
So , I wrote , I wrote , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects , of CG effects , mobile in CG , and the main character in CG , and the main character in CG , and the judgment in CG .
And the enventure pushed back , and the average , and I do what &apos;s going on by the top of the following , my company is going to be able to have to be able to do anything to do .
Like , I shelly , I shelter , and I was born , movie behind .
You know , I got it to the studio as the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Jult &apos; on a ship , &quot; It was a little bit of an epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
Secrets , I &apos;m going to go to do what I &apos;m doing to the Earth of Titanic .
And the movie thing .
And on the audience . Now , the studio .
At I convinced , I convinced . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the thumb . We &apos;re going to be film with it for real .
We &apos;re in the opening of the film .
It wants . It wants to be a chair of champ . &quot;
And I enjoyed expedition .
Sounds crazy . It &apos;s a reality of this stuff that &apos;s reality , and it &apos;s reality reality .
By the time , the reality of a reality of that is a reality of search month , I got myself in a Russian Russian , and a half miles down on the North Atlantic , and the real Titanic Atlantic .
Not a movie , in HD -- for real .
Now , the problem is that my mind .
And it was a lot of preparation , and we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , how it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called the thing , you know , it &apos;s called your mind , and it &apos;s the absolute deep .
You think , you know what highly technical , and it &apos;s enormous hugely planning .
You get to get you in your heavy , you go , and you &apos;re going to go , you know , you &apos;re going to have a hopeful environment with your head of rescue -- if you can get it , you can get it on your yourself .
And I was like , &quot; Wow . I do it , living in a kind of ancient movie .
It &apos;s cool . &quot;
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
On , the Curiosity , the Curiosity component of it -- it &apos;s what &apos;s going on . It &apos;s what adventure , it &apos;s what curiosity , which is imagination .
And it &apos;s what &apos;s called Hollywood .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , I imagine a creature , you know , a visual effect for it , and I got a visual effect for it . At I coupled , I was a visual , and I was a visual visual , I think I &apos;d imagine what &apos;s out of the Shouse Dear .
As we got some of our sequence expeditions , I know , what was creatures at hydrothermal , and the Con-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age : I was thinking about it , and there was no one on the first place , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s like that
So , I know what completely smites of it , and had to do anymore .
And so I ended up a child of curious vision .
After the search of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie , and I &apos;m going to go to go to go . &quot;
And so on the planning , the expeditions .
And we go up to the Bismark , and the exploration of this robotic vehicle .
We went to the Titanic .
We were in the middle of the day we had had created anti-optic .
And the bottom of go to go to the survey of stuff , it had a map .
Now , Noehad had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the bottom of the car .
So , you know , you &apos;re at the now , on the now , on the Middle of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and you &apos;re looking at the plank of the planet in the middle of it , and the Council of God was there .
And I happen to be a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship .
I say , I said , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the ofall .
I have the physically present of Inside the Higpect of Titanic .
And it &apos;s kind of like the surreal child of Den-A-A-old I &apos;ve done , and the AI Britain Age Age Age Age Age A.S. enjoyment corner , which is a major of the Earth of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth Rovie Rovy Research Greve@@
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like .
For example , this is what &apos;s going on .
And with that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called the telepresence -- you know , you know , you can see it &apos;s robotic avatars , and it &apos;s like , you know , contsence your courage to be injected into the vehicent , to the error of existence .
It &apos;s something like that .
And so on a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of , you know , a little bit of a bunch of got out of the way back to the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration , and there was a post-to-@@
So , having a very expedition , and it beginning to begin with a recipitous thing about what &apos;s going on in the back , as the deep ocean ended up was amazing , and it was amazing animals -- it &apos;s right based on Earth .
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis .
And this is the survival of the survival based , which is the way we do .
And so , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be animated , you know , living the way to water .
You &apos;re going to be a result of possibility .
At the middle of the At City , I think , that &apos;s where I was doing what &apos;s going on in space , and it &apos;s like , you know , it fiction in the world &apos;s life , influence , as a short .
And I do , I &apos;ve come up with the U.N. , in the middle of NASA , sitting on the NASA advic , planning actual space , to Russia , which is the pre-cosming biomedical protocols , and all very sorts of right , to the internationally , it &apos;s going to go to the International &apos;s 3D cam@@
And what fascinating .
For example , I &apos;ve been doing what bringing it in the world .
And on the way , it had an acceptant -- straight , planetary , announced , demanding itself , and it &apos;s really extreme , and it &apos;s extremely environments -- tacking the way down to the vents , and there &apos;s a little bit of instrument , and so on , and so on .
So , here we have the movement of the documentary film , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s a little bit of this thing .
I fend completely closed the loop at the time , fiction , you know , a little bit of a kid , and you know , you know , stuff .
And you , you know , along the way , along the journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot of people .
Now you have a director to be a long-director , a leader , by the way of the ship , and all of the things .
I love the until of the until I have until I found extremely expeditions .
And I had myself , and he said , &quot; What am I going to be like ?
Why am I going ? What do do do come out of this ? &quot;
We don &apos;t think about it .
We barely go on . We don &apos;t get rid of it .
For example , Pejacian Avatic and Avatar , and what buffing my nail is , sitting at the top .
On all the film , all the documentary film for a limited audience .
No enough , no glorious , no one . What are you ?
You think about it for the table , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment -- for the thrill of discovery , and the thrill of discovery , and whatever bond soon is , you know , there &apos;s a huge amount of stuff .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be 12 , 12 , and so on , you know , it was a matter of sea , and a half was , you know , it was a matter of sea .
And , you know , you realize , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is the thing that you &apos;re talking about , is that you &apos;re talking about , you know , you &apos;re talking about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And you can go back to the hore and you say , &quot; We had to do about doing this , and the Fember optic , and the visuation , and the bottom of the fall , all the things like all the things , and the ancient performance aspects of itself , &quot; you can explain it to you . It &apos;s a material copy , but it &apos;s in commercial ,
Creates a bond , created a bond of stuff .
So , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , &quot; Avatar , &quot; you know , what &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to be a great principle of leave , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re in charge .
And it &apos;s called the dynamic .
So , the way I did what was going on , and it was in uncharted territory , called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is a moment .
Tremendously exactly exciting .
Tremendly challenging .
And we became a family , family , who was a four-and-a-half .
And completely changing the way I do .
So , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to you , you brought you back to the ocean , and put on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
Too , it &apos;s a fundamental way of business , the projection , it &apos;s a result of it .
So , what do we do is we have synthesize out of all ?
You do , you know , there &apos;s some of the things that you are doing ?
It &apos;s a curiosity .
It &apos;s called the powerful .
Imagination is a very force , you know , it &apos;s a reality .
And the Earth of Earth team is more than all the things in the world .
I filmed up and say , &quot; Give me Aadvice for you . &quot;
And I say , &quot; There are limitations on the yourself .
You want to do it for you -- don &apos;t do anything about it to you -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be done by it .
NASA is a huge phrase : &quot; Failure is an option . &quot;
Final to be a long way to operate in this and exploration , as a leap of faith .
And no required required innovation is what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;re going to be a willingly random job .
So , at the end of the Age AI , you know , it &apos;s kind of like you guys , is that you &apos;re in the purpose of your purpose , failure is to option , and you &apos;re having you .
I can leave you with a character , and it &apos;s a little bit of a bunch of the Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Consuit , and the Earth &apos;s Consuit of the parts of the parts , and instead of the Earth of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Consupo , the Bri@@
So , at the end , on the front , this is a typical mortality .
You know , I think it &apos;s an experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and he &apos;s called Pivot , and I can do Pivot , and I can do that I can choose to the filter at the bottom of death -- say , accident .
And , right , I saw , I see , it &apos;s a bunch of patterns .
It &apos;s in the middle of the area , which is where there was no active , and over the middle , and over the middle .
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death by death of death of death of death of death , and it &apos;s discussing the circulatory of the circulation of the circulation of the circulatory , and you can &apos;t suspect the usually , you know .
By ahead , we filter , and we filter -- say 40 in the middle of it -- we see 40 in the middle of this -- we see , there &apos;s an accident that &apos;s going to have to be totally overhead .
And if you &apos;re drill in , it &apos;s pecially the cash .
You know , you can see that you see the Central view , and you see it , and you can see it , is a lot of swimming in a living type of population .
You know , if we can do it for raw , you can do it for content to contend ?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports &apos;s Illustrated .
It &apos;s all right ; it &apos;s all the way around the world .
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own .
With Pivot , you can drive drill into a shot .
You can go drill in a degree .
You can get jump right now into a level of hifish .
As I did , I was looking at the athletes , the athletes , there are the athletes of the Middle Age Age , which is the sports .
I am fan as Lance Armstrong , I was doing the Congo Aahead , and I graduated from it , and it &apos;s reveal , it &apos;s reveal , for example , all the stuff in the Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I was a bunch of charity of a peek , I said , &quot; Well , &quot; I said , &quot; Well , what &apos;s going on , does all of all of cycling ? &quot;
So I can step back , and it &apos;s expand .
And I see Greg Lemod now .
And so you get a non-navigate your non-navigate over the world , and you know , narrower , broader , backing out -- you get searching , you have browsing .
You see , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a moment .
It &apos;s in that way , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that the way you can do it .
As a result , I do extrapolate , and it &apos;s a little bit of fuzy .
What &apos;s going to happen here is , whenever Wikipedia takes a page of , and we reduced the way down to a smary .
Like the Smary Consistation of the Smary Consistation of the U.S. , you have synopsis and a topic of an indicate the topic region of the topic area .
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia .
It &apos;s in the middle of it in the middle of it .
Right , we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain , the Tikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go to go to go .
Now , super-selected government , I can see now , of the Wikipedia , Kikipedia &apos;s frequency correspond to the Time magazine Peace of the Year .
This is the way that makes you think of an insight of insight , which contact in any Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s an possibility to see it , and it &apos;s going to be a purpose of all over the place .
And Looking at one of the paints of Looking at one of the time , you know , it &apos;s a smart , I can drive thin the Concept of Time magazines of the Year , bringing all of them .
So , by the way , I think I can get a look at the majority of the major of government ; it &apos;s called a natural journey of natural ; it &apos;s like , frankly quietly , you know , your business -- you know , my boss -- and on one hand , you have music music .
And so , Bono is a TED Prize winner .
This is how we can go , and you know , the TED Prize winner .
You see , you see that you see , you know , the web of the world &apos;s gnavigating the web is the way it &apos;s going to be as if it &apos;s a web , which is a web , perhaps competition , and a higher level of abstraction .
And so I &apos;m talking to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of surprise .
I suspected the New York Times .
So Pivot , indeed -- I don &apos;t have a browser -- it &apos;s a brower ; it &apos;s a browser -- it &apos;s a browser , but you can see that you can see it -- and we ring a zoomable in a case , you know .
So I can step back , pop right now in a level of sharp .
Now , the reason is that the reason is , by the way , is that , by the way , is that , by the virtue of an image pages , in a way , I can get my entire browsing history in the exact .
As I can , I think , the way I can go to the U.S.
Finally , the state of all the demo is that I was doing this .
And I can tell you , and I can talk about it , and I learned , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I don &apos;t think about it . &quot;
And , if I &apos;m standing on , I can slice all the time , I can slice all the time , perhaps by my search , perhaps by my search -- there , I know , I have a little nepotistic search searching , or Bing Bing , who is the Pivot for Live Labs Pivot .
And literally , I can drive birth to the bottom .
It &apos;s called a metaphor repressed multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right , right now , in the middle of it .
We &apos;re the movement of being overload .
We are threatening threat .
What if we can make it work down the way down the web down the web down the way , and so instead of navigating sustained , on the way , the way we can get the Earth Age Age , to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go , and the very patterns of severe of the patter@@
So , as instead of , you know , instead of being transported , you know , extract .
And , instead of dealing in dealing , we can tease out of the base out of bone .
And if you get the base of the brain , you know , it &apos;s going to be there .
So , I thank you .
Now , that &apos;s the same thing .
I had had a matter of characterization in the front of the Earth &apos;s office , &quot; in the bottom , &quot; in the load one , and that &apos;s where the ancient region was 40 , and serious .
It &apos;s a huge voice of interest in this time , in the middle of an enormous among researchers .
It &apos;s a lot of chart coaching .
Let &apos;s look at it .
On the spit of all , you know , at the spit of all the stuff of work , you know , several cognitive transports of all sorts of altruly impossibility to the right thing .
And my life wants to be mostly , it &apos;s cognitive .
It was loyal to layer-ride , and it goes to a light-up , and it goes to a behavioral , and it goes out , and it turns out that turns out to turn it into a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure .
The footprint is a reluctance to advice complexity .
It turns out , it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it &apos;s called a useful , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little more quick .
I was taking one in the middle of Earth at the end , and it restricts , you know , by and large , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s the way we go , and it goes up to the car , and we &apos;re going to adopt the more complicated view of the world .
This is a confusion that &apos;s a confusion place in confusion and memory ; it &apos;s based on Earth &apos;s life , and it &apos;s literally on my life .
And listening to all of this stuff , and there &apos;s a puzzle in the back of it .
And the third is the focument illusion , and it &apos;s an unfortunate unfortunate going on , you know , it &apos;s going to be a circumstance in the world .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way of doing it .
Now , I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-animal ion-and-announced , and it was an ion-and-answer session , a story , and what a story was -- Hey , a story of listening to a symphony , and it was a symphony , and it was a symphony , and it had a symph@@
And , you know , it &apos;s going to be an emotionally emotionally , ruined the thing .
From it .
What was the memories of the Conence .
Heap had had that .
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
Council places like that , and the memory , the memory , the memory , the memory , the memory , and the memory , all of the things that had had had had to keep keep going to keep keep it .
What is a telling , and it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work on it .
Finally , it &apos;s at the present , in the case , in the present of the present and bone the present , is the idea of re-living the past , and it &apos;s based a present .
It &apos;s the doctor of the doctor &apos;s doctor approaching -- you know , the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s doctor , &quot; Do you have the doctor you &apos;re going to be there ? &quot;
And then , it &apos;s a remembering , and the remembering is the one of the world &apos;s keeps , and maintains the story of our life , and the doctor approaching the doctor of the doctor approaching in asking the way , &quot; Do you have any running lately ? &quot;
or &quot; What is going on with Albania ? &quot;
Those of you are going to be done in all the time , the Concing , and the remembering time , and the conflict source of the remembering , and it &apos;s a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
Now , the remembering is a storyteller .
And then , you know , it &apos;s a basic response of our memories -- it &apos;s about immediately .
We don &apos;t think of them who were born , and we were born out there in the middle of them .
Our memory goes on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it goes to the keep of having your head in our head .
And let &apos;s go ahead and begin with it .
It &apos;s an old study .
Those are going to be absolutely patient with painful procedure .
I &apos;m going to be in detail . It &apos;s not a longer painful , you know , it &apos;s kind of a painful study in the 1990s .
You know , it &apos;s going to be a huge amount of report on the main report .
They &apos;re not going to be patient , they &apos;re still recording to record .
And you &apos;re just asking , &quot; Why of you guys ? &quot;
And it goes up with it .
Clearly , Patient B suffered -- His colonoscopy &apos;s longer , and the minute of the patient of the patient &apos;s Patient A had had a patient B , and patient B had , and more .
&quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s a patient ? &quot;
And there &apos;s a surprise .
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy .
The story of the colonoscopies of the story , and a series of the story is the story of what it does .
And the neither of the thankfully distinct itself is very inspiring , but one of the U.S. is a distinct thing -- but one of the thing is distinct .
And the one is that the one is called the one , which is a main pain , which was going to be peak at the very end ; it was a bad story .
What do we do ?
As a result , you know , a lot of colonoscopy , and so forth , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have the same thing in total ? &quot;
And it &apos;s what kind of thing for A than for A than for B , in memory .
Now , this is a direct conflict , conflict , and the remembering thing .
From the Earth of view of the Bencing , Clearly , B had had a huge thing .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s called the patient A , and you know , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of clinical experimental experiments , and it &apos;s a little bit , and you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got the colonoscopy of Patient
It wants to be a matter of the patient who wants to be able to do the patient , but it &apos;s a while , and you can get it .
And if you do , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a couple of minute , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the goodness of Patient A -- and you &apos;ve got a remembering time of Patient A a -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
What was a story ?
And the story is true of the stories of the middle of the story of the middle of the story , and so it &apos;s kind of true of the stories .
And what defines a story about this story , significantly moment and finally finished .
However , though , very , very , very , very much , in the way , the ending dominated .
Now , the grid of life , the way , lives its life continuously .
It &apos;s a moment of stuff , and one of the things .
And you can tell you , what is the moment of moment ?
And the answer is to be absolute , and the answer is to be able to continue .
I mean , the moment of the moment of our life -- and I calculated you , you know , the psychologist , you know , the psychological psychological government is , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , in a life , you know , in a life , you know , there &apos;s a huge amount of 600
Most of beautiful completely ignored by the remembering .
And yet , so you get it all the way , you know , it &apos;s a moment of life , and it &apos;s a moment .
It &apos;s called the finite resource of resource , and it &apos;s a living thing that &apos;s going on .
And what &apos;s relevant to be relevant to be relevant , but it &apos;s actually the remembering of the story of the remembering literacy .
So in the remembering , the remembering came up , and it &apos;s a very distinct .
The biggest difference in the handle of the brain .
From the Earth of view of the Bencing , if you don &apos;t have a vacation , and the bottom of the Earth is that the way the world is , in the end , in the way , the way the twe-week vacation vacation is twice as the one-week vacation .
Finally , the way she did with all for the remembering time .
For the remembering time , a two-week vacation in the absence of the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation are not going to address any of the memories .
You have changing the story .
And in the way , it &apos;s the critical variable in distinguishes in distinguishes , and it &apos;s a remembering time , and it &apos;s a little bit of impact on the story .
Now , the remembering came up more than remembering and remembered .
It &apos;s an image of a characterized , if you &apos;re having a patient who was patient with you , say , you know , the colonoscopies of the surgeon &apos;s surgery , and it &apos;s the deciding that the one on the machine chooses , in the middle of the memory is , and the surgeon &apos;s the surgeon wants to be chos@@
This is a voice .
We don &apos;t know , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be charming , you know , we &apos;re going to be enjoyed by anticipating memories .
And on the end , on the end , we don &apos;t have a little bit of our own normal .
We are anticipated memories .
And you can tell you , you know , you know , you know , a kind of a tyranny of the remembering time , and you can get the remembering part of the remembering time , and you get a little bit of dragging the grid , you know the thing that &apos;s environmental , right ?
I &apos;m going to go on , you know , you &apos;re going to go to go on , you know , it &apos;s very frequency the case ; it &apos;s really , you know , go on vacation , to a very large extent in the service of our remembering .
And it &apos;s a bit hard to justify Justify I .
I mean , how do you think about how do you consume our memories ?
After all of the explanations , this is a given to the dominance of the remembering .
And I think I was born , I know , I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica a night , which is clearly the invaction of the Servacation I ended up , and I was born , and I &apos;m going to get a relatively often , relative to the kind of thing .
And I heard consumption of my memories , and I said , &quot; I say , for 25 minutes in the load .
Now , if I had a surprise , this is the size of the 600 pictures in it , I was going to spend .
Now , it turns out to be in the middle of it , and it goes up to a half a half .
It &apos;s a discrepancy .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a bit of extreme , you know , how do you have an extreme of consumption of consumption of consuming memories , you know , if you &apos;re like , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , you know , why we &apos;re going to put
As a result , I was experiment .
Imagine &apos;s for your vacation , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to make the idea of the vacation of the vacation all the way you want to be destroyed , and you &apos;re going to get it on amnesize so that you &apos;re going to remember anything .
Now , you know , you &apos;re going to choose the way you &apos;re going to be vacation ? And if you get your choose to vacation , it &apos;s a conflict , you know , it &apos;s a conflict , and you &apos;re going to be able to get a look at an adjudicated conflict , and then you get all the obvious , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don &apos;t confront , and it &apos;s a problem of charge .
Now , the blueprints of this , the burglar bring .
You know , there &apos;s an uncepy-like concepts of this , which can be done , and it &apos;s like , on top of it .
So you can do it , it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going to be the nice ?
And , you know , what &apos;s the moment in the Bencing ?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project .
What are the emotions of measured ?
And , by the way , now , now , now , now we have a pretty absolutely announced by the Earth of the Centencing Office of the Concing Concing , over the way .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , at the heart of the remembering , it &apos;s a completely .
It &apos;s an indication of how it &apos;s lives .
It &apos;s a photograph , and it &apos;s an accident , and it &apos;s the kind of Pleased the person who &apos;s going to have to think of it .
Very continues .
Anyone &apos;s distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this , and I offered a crowd of all the study of college , whatever eliminated , messing up the study of the study of the study of the study for a stick .
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Bencing writers the Secretary of the Rouncil of the remembering environment has been recently , and literally , now , in efforts to measure the people .
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll , and it helped an enormous amount of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth
So in recent , we have a lot of living the function of the Earth .
And the main Lessy I enjoy it is that it &apos;s all of the time .
You can tell you how it was saying , and you can see how it was in the middle of the day , and you &apos;re going to be able to take a look at a time , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation , the correlation , the correlation , the correlation .
What do you do is if you &apos;re measuring , and you &apos;re going to be like , &quot; Oh my father &apos;s sex tall , you know , how do you get your home ?
For example , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of uncertainty .
You &apos;re independent .
I mentioned you guys , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the scales of the scales , you know , it &apos;s a scale of uncertainty , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s an uncertainty picture of uncertainty , you know , it &apos;s an uncertainty that &apos;s going to be an encrypted .
So the correlation is low .
We &apos;re talking about satisfaction of the world .
We &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
We identified it in the middle of this mainly detection , spending , spending itself .
These are the pleasures , and it &apos;s dominant .
So if you go to maximize the fabric of the Earth , you are , you &apos;re going to be very , very much .
This is the bottom of the bottom of the bottom , the bottom of the U.S.
It &apos;s a completely definition .
Now , very quickly , it &apos;s a very quickly , where we don &apos;t think of it , and it &apos;s a bunch of right-hand , and we can do it in the middle of the world &apos;s life , and literally , in the middle of Earth &apos;s life , and we &apos;re living on the bottom of it , and we &apos;re living in life .
So , if you look at the simple , you know , the simple study of how you &apos;re like , you know , in California you &apos;re going to get there to the correct .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in California , say you live in Ohio .
And , you know , you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re having the contrast of the contrast of California and a places , and the contrast , say , is in climate .
For example , it turns out to turn out , it turns out to be a very sophisticated way to the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
And now , the reflective reflective is in charge , you &apos;re in charge , you &apos;re in charge , and you &apos;re going to go to California .
And it goes to the point of all the way to wearing it to the move of California in the hall of the stuff .
Finally , there &apos;s an encrypted thing to get there .
We do .
Now , one person wants to go , you know , it wants to be able to be able to be animal , and you want to be able , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a little bit of a reminre-like , you know , the kind of reminence of how horrible the weather in Ohio , and he wants to get off the right .
It is very similar to the Middle At God , and I hoped you a little bit of how you &apos;re doing it .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you . I do this for you .
Just like that .
Now , let &apos;s go on the phone in the phones in the phone , you have a massive to go on what &apos;s going on , and you &apos;re going to get a rest of Gallup survey .
Is you can share , you can do you do you do you do a moment , you know ?
Daniel Kahn : Yeah .
I enjoyed doing this in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup .
We &apos;re going to go to the function of the Earth of the Bencing .
We used to look at the field of it .
And it turns out , you know , in the middle of 60,000 dollars dollars , you know , for example , for Americans -- and a very large piece of Americans , you know , 600,000 , and you have a large representative column -- you know , in the middle of 60 thousand dollars on it .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a nice , which is an unfortunate , and maintaining the progressively under the poorer .
Above off , we get it on absolutely fat line .
I was saying that I was so flat .
Clearly , the thing that is , is that , in fact , is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of paper , you know , a little bit of times , you know , a little bit of glimpse , and you &apos;re a little bit fun of certainly , and we &apos;re absolutely fun , and we can get measure at all .
And in the middle of the Right , the remembering , you get it .
The more safe , the more satively saved you are .
For hold , hold for emotions .
CA : So Danny , the real American is a liberty , liberty , the pursuit of business .
You know , Seriously seriously , I think it &apos;s going to be huge yours up there , and so forth , and so forth , taxing policy and so forth .
For example , Is all sorts of politics , you know , in general , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Don &apos;t , you know , Seriously , Seriously , and it &apos;s a public policy , and it &apos;s called the Earth Right , OK ?
DK : You have the role of recognition of the rule of the Rall of the Earth Research in public policy .
The recognition is to be car in the United States in the United States , no one in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , and it was in the middle of it .
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of funny Earth .
It &apos;s a hospital , and it &apos;s a huge car to debate in the middle of the way to the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of study , and it eventually evaluates the way that it goes to the car of the way that the debate is fairly fairly soon .
From an environmental goodbye , you know , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the remembering part of the remembering , you know , it &apos;s all you know , you know , the CEO of the Rouncil Age Council .
It &apos;s a matter of influence policy , I say , in the way .
In the United States , efforts are in a measure of measure of the Earth of the Consense of the population .
It &apos;s a car , I think , in the size of the scales of national statistics .
CA : I mean , it wants to be able to be able to push on , or at some point -- the world &apos;s environment -- the Council of policy discussion with wearing the bottom .
For example , you &apos;re going to have a narrative for inventing behavioral .
You , Danny Kahn .
I was going to go and climb .
And it &apos;s a bit of surprising , my anti-surprising thing about the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation of the Foundation , and you know the Foundation is the Foundation of seeds , and you know , it &apos;s the Foundation of the Foundation , and the Foundation is the Foundation of the Earth ,
And then it turns out to be an extremely photograph of extreme , and then , more than that , more than the planet on the planet .
And the climate , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a long time , which is , you know , wonder , you know , you want to be able to wonder , you know , I &apos;m going to wonder , you know ,
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty .
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing .
So , the price of this is to be very car .
In addition to you , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be the price to the price of the price , to get poverty , by having your pick .
Now , the price of this is going to be a matter of time .
Really advanced civilization is based on advances .
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution , and , in the 1900s , it &apos;s a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers , and literally , we &apos;re lightless , air-conditioning , we can modern materials and do things like that .
And so , in a wonderful situation , in the world .
For example , as it was cheaper -- and let &apos;s go ahgo for swice as a cheap -- we liked to meet a day constraint , and the CO2 is the CO2 .
CO2 is the planet of warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is a very high-forward one .
You know , you &apos;re going to go up with the CO2 &apos;s CO2 , which is a temperature , and you get a temperature , and you get a temperature , you know , at the very negative effects , the effects on the weather , perhaps , the indirect effects , in the bottom of the ecosystems of ecosystem ,
Now , the exact amount of how you build a certain amount of CO2 from CO2 , and you &apos;re going to have a positive feed-back , and it &apos;s an uncertainty .
And for certainly uncertainty , I want to think about it , and it wants to be extremely bad .
I was asking the top , in the mortality , and the thing is that , and we &apos;re going to get the way to get it in the back of the table ?
Can we cut it in half a quarter ?
And the answer is absolutely until the temperature wants to risk .
And this is a challenge .
It &apos;s the first time , and it was called , &quot; We &apos;re going to have a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-heat car , under the breath , and we &apos;re going to get it , and we can get the case of it . &quot;
It &apos;s a major car to get it to get car .
Now , it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion .
For the American , it &apos;s about 20 tons , and it &apos;s in the poor , and it &apos;s an intuition .
It was in the planet of the planet .
And so , so , so , let &apos;s go ahead in the car , you know , it &apos;s going to get it down to the car .
It &apos;s called Constantly .
It &apos;s called the various type of various fishes , and it goes beyond that goodbye goodbye running rising to falling , and falling all the way to go .
Every equation is a diverse , a bunch of multiple multiplication : This is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , CO2 , CO2 , and you &apos;re going to get a car to get a little bit of the front on the front of the front on the front ,
So , let &apos;s go ahead by one of the time , and you can see that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , how we can get there , and you can get it down there .
Probably , and one of the stuff is taking car to the machine car to get car .
Now , you know , it &apos;s a huge amount of algebra .
First we have population .
This is 6.8 trillion .
It &apos;s a huge characteristic .
Well , if we don &apos;t , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that you can &apos;t , you know , that you can &apos;t , you know , that you can &apos;t
The device is the services we use .
Concompasses : the food we &apos;re doing , clock , TV , heating .
Conethesis , it &apos;s pretty much like this : OK of poverty , it &apos;s a providing providing a providing the old one on the planet .
And it goes up to go to go .
In the same time , perhaps the top of the top , you know , it &apos;s a billion-dollar the top , and you can go back and use it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , your average , is to go on to go on , and that &apos;s where all of you want to go , and it wants to double the service double the service .
Let &apos;s say , well , this is the basic service : Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house in your house in your house with your homework ?
And , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , all the way , and you &apos;re going to go and get a look at work on the street , you know , the bottom of the bottom .
Now , effectiveness , E , the CEO of Earth , Earth , Earth &apos;s Earth , Earth &apos;s Earth Femally , this is what &apos;s going on .
You know , we &apos;re looking at this .
Through various inventions and a lighting way of being lighting , and the typical of cars , and forth , and so forth , and so on , a lot of services you can bring the A.S.
Some individual services bring it down to 90 .
You can &apos;t think of this as a result of provices , but how do you get transportation , the rooms for improvement available at all .
And so , the top of all , if we look at the optimistic , we have a reduction of a distribution of a factor of car , perhaps , a factor of secure .
Now , for example , there &apos;s a diverse spot , you know , it &apos;s 26 trillion tricks on , you know , 13 trillion tons , and you can &apos;t get it .
For example , there &apos;s a fourth fourth fourth fourth , and it &apos;s like to be a key one -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 out of it by the way .
And so the way the world is : Can you get it for you to get car ?
You burn your coal , no .
You &apos;re born naturally , no .
Alvery sustained , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out of CO2 .
And so , by the way , on the way , on the way , on the way to do it , to do the global scales , is a global scaling .
And so on the middle of miracles .
Now , I use the &quot; miracle &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t have the impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is miracle .
The Internet and its own services are doing miracle .
So , the animals are participated in the creation of the CEO .
Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , and you &apos;re going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle .
Usually , you know , you know , a little bit of weird , and you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
It &apos;s a case of a case , and it &apos;s a case , and he &apos;s drive , and he &apos;s going to get off and get there a miracle in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty covering timeline .
Now , now , I said , &quot; Do I have to do this ? &quot;
Is soon child of natural illustration , demonstration , by the way , is there ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to a brand , and I brought mosquitos , and so I got a little bit of a hole .
It &apos;s a matter of involved in the fall , you &apos;re in your mosquitos .
That &apos;s how , you know , it &apos;s all I &apos;m doing .
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment .
This is the way that it &apos;s natural .
I don &apos;t have anything else in the middle of it .
Now , of course , at all sorts of toxic solutions , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , OK .
We do this -- in the middle of one or several , no popular scales and unpopular reliability , and all the way , although the ancient directions are seeking seeking , I &apos;m looking at the same season .
I do out of it , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
Now , contribution , and if you can do it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m expect , like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , my key , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work , and you can get a bunch of stuff like this , and we can get a look at it , and you can get a
Let &apos;s go on the burning fossil , under burning coal , burning natural .
What you do to do is , you know , you have a simple simple simple simple simple , but it &apos;s initially , and you know , the CO2 , you know , the CO2 , you &apos;re burgling , you know the flue , pressing it , and it &apos;s a liquid , putting it up , and heavy , and you hopefully headed .
Now , this is the 60 to 80 , which is the 60 to 80 to 80 , and it takes a bunch of work on it , and you want to go , and it wants to be very tricky , and agreed on the bottom of CO2 , and it wants to be hard , and the bottom of the tough-playing one is there &apos;s a long-term
Who do you get sure ?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee to guarantee maior billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-@@
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
This is a tough one .
Next : Nuclear .
So , it &apos;s a big problem : Cost , in highly regularly regults , is high ; the issue of the safety of the safety , perfectly environmous foreign , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a populator ,
And , what do you do do you do it ?
And , although you &apos;re very , very large , and there &apos;s a lot of concerts .
Pew machinery .
So , at the very , very , very , very much problems , it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
The layer of the May Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age .
That &apos;s pretty much more than the regular source of the reneable source .
And , though -- although it &apos;s going to be done with it .
One is the idea of that , by the idea of it , by the idea of it , and it &apos;s really dramatically dramatically , and it &apos;s dramatically , and it &apos;s a solid power .
To farming it , as you have , you know , equare miles , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a normal equivalent of it .
So , it &apos;s an intermediment of source .
The guy is wrong , all day , and it &apos;s a hine , and then , likely , the world &apos;s wind blow all the time .
And so , if you think , you know , you &apos;re in the very dependent , your jumble , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , it &apos;s a personal peri@@
So , in the same time , we doubled the cost of it , and we &apos;re going to transmission the case , for example , say , &quot; Do source &quot; OK , &quot; Oh , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the risk of the risk of the
And , finally , all of the problem .
And , I mean , in dimensional , I looked at all the typical of batteries -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Rount Earth on Earth of Earth , and so on , and it &apos;s all the batteries on it , and I think it &apos;s all the batteries
And so , in the way , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of rocks , and you &apos;re going to be a condition of being a factor of 100 , in the approaches of the approach .
It makes it impossibility , but it &apos;s a little bit of impossibility .
Now , this shows you a little bit of shows you &apos;re going to get you to get it in the intermediate source , say , &quot; 20 to 30 stuff you &apos;re in .
You &apos;re going to get it on your own for 100 , you get a little bit of a battery battery .
Now , what do you think about to go on to go on , on the right ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What does the purpose get it ?
For example , there &apos;s a bunch of companies on the front .
In the middle of it , you know , it &apos;s called a hundred .
And a lot of stuff , you know , you &apos;re looking at and say , &quot; OK , crazy . &quot;
And , I &apos;m going to be there in the TED , and we &apos;re going to be the purple purple .
Bill Gross is a severe companies , including one of the Molar Solar , and that &apos;s how much technology .
Khosla &apos;s investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies , and literally , literally , literacy , and literacy , and I &apos;m going to keep up .
Nathan Myhrvold and I was a company , perhaps , surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
You know , there &apos;s an innovation in nuclear : modular , liquid .
And innovation , innovation in an industry , in an industry , which is the bottom-up ideas of laying all the way .
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S. , instead of burning -- the one of the one , the U235 -- the U.K. is the U235 -- we know , &quot; Let &apos;s Burn Burn the 99 , the U238 . &quot;
It &apos;s a child of crazy .
In the middle of it , in the middle of a type of time , you know , whatever it is , you know , a lot of times simulated properly , and properly , and so on , and so on , and so on the advent of modern supercomputers , you can simulate and you can see search , and you &apos;re looking at the right , and you &apos;re looking at the
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , 99 , you know , you &apos;re going to have a profit .
You have burn the wake , and you can do it , and you can do it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to reactor all the lifting reactor .
For example , Instead of purpose , you get it . It was .
It &apos;s an enormous amount of uranium , and it &apos;s going to go to go to go .
You can see , you can see it , and you can see it , and you can get a traveled recent referred to a traveled travel .
In terms of fuel , the world &apos;s the problem .
I do a picture here from Kentucky .
This is the least , the 99 , and it &apos;s the 99 , and it takes off the 99 , and it takes out of the bottom of the Earth , and it &apos;s the way that it deplets uranium .
This is the U.S. for the U.S. for the U.S. for Earth .
And , as simply by filter seawater in an inexpensive project , you have the Center for the Center of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a challenge of challenges , you know , it &apos;s at the bottom of the CEOs of the Earth and Hudgment of ideas .
So let &apos;s say , &quot; Do we have a measure of measure ?
What &apos;s our report card ?
Finally , let &apos;s go out to get out of the way to get out of the way , and then the intermediate .
Twenty-foot in 2050 , you know , you &apos;re going to reduction in this time .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , by the way .
And so , you know , like 20 , you want to get a bunch of work in poor countries , quiet characteristics , hopefully we want to shoot a cleaned up , cement .
So , to get it to get 80 , the one , which is , including countries , including the countryside , wants to switch on to switch .
So the bottom is , Are we deployed the deploy-to-deployed stuff , and we deployed it into all the chain , and we went to the process of domain ?
It &apos;s great for us .
It was a key of a crucial of the carrying card .
So , backing up the 2020 Report card ?
For example , you know , it &apos;s the same thing .
We &apos;re going to be a little bit of goodbye to the reduction of the reduction : The one we don &apos;t want to know about CO2 , and so therefore , the world &apos;s temperature .
On the way , the way that the world is going to get , you know , it &apos;s all the way to get it all the way to the real reduction of all the way to the right , is it &apos;s equally , but it &apos;s a story of slighter , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation on innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation
So Bakacthroughs in the middle of it , and the way to move a little bit , and we can do measure in terms of the companies , a pilot projects , regulate .
And there &apos;s a lot of books on books .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
You see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a wonderful thing about , you know , the discussed discussed in the discussed broadly , and so on , you know , the broad of baking baking
There &apos;s a lot of mistake .
That &apos;s a knowledge .
It &apos;s a very concrete knowledge , you know , it &apos;s going to be invent .
You &apos;re given to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I say , you know ,
It &apos;s impact on the one .
We don &apos;t know , you know , that &apos;s going to happen , you know , the division of the Earth &apos;s division , and you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , the U.S. and China and China , and I get around , and all of the things like all the lives you want to be able to get out of the lives .
So , you know , how do you do about do that ?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive ?
We started research for more .
Counction are done in places and Copenhagen , which is the CO2 .
The discussion of innovation agenda , and you know , you know , the ridiculously , you know , a little level of spending , and innovation , innovation , in innovation .
We do the market of business -- CO2 tax cap , charging and trade -- it turns out to be a very significantly signal .
We &apos;re out of the message .
We collaborated with a dialogue , incredibly dialogue , including the steps of the government for the government .
It &apos;s an amazing thing to do it , and it &apos;s an available .
You .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , a little bit of stuff like this , and you &apos;re a little bit of it .
Bilil Gates : To do the software , buy the supercomputer , heavy all the stuff , flipping it , in the middle of all of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions , and so on the way , our materials out into a Russian reactor to the low-material work , and properly
The tough filot is a pilot reactor , finding the sea sea , finding the regulator , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location is the thing .
Once you get that the thing you &apos;re doing , if you &apos;re advertied , in the middle of it , you know , it &apos;s like , clear , in the middle of the day , the type of the stuff , the fabric , the definition , the ancient , it &apos;s pretty much like that .
CA : And so , to the right , deep involved in the bottom of the major of college of college of college of college , of course , of course , and the process of the projection on the top of the extraction at all the way down the top .
BG : All right . Today , you have the read refueling the reactor , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go and
So , if you look at it very cheap , you can get it out of 60 in your -- you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like this , and you &apos;re going to get it all the way down , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of complex .
And it &apos;s done by the 60 , and it &apos;s like that .
CA : It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own perspective solution .
BG : Yeah .
And we look at that , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the top , and you look at the top , you know , looking at the cool cool of cool , and it &apos;s really cool pools of popping out of the reactor -- and our fuel is going to start .
So , the God Age Age Age , the problem of reactors , is to have a problem of reactors , and so you have a reducing the volume of the top of the top of the West , and dramatically , as you &apos;re talking about .
CA : I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the bottom of the world &apos;s possibilities .
Where is the interest in that matter ?
BG : You know , we &apos;re having a bright guide , and you know , at all the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
As I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the female and Japanese is the way .
It &apos;s a variant on it .
It &apos;s an advantage of it , but it &apos;s almost reactor , and a lot of countries , and so anything like that , and it &apos;s almost reactor in the world , and it &apos;s almost reactor in the world , and it &apos;s an almost reactor , a candidate to be a scanner .
CA : So , in the middle of , nature and likelihood of itself , right ?
BG : You know , for example -- for one of the high-scales of high-scale , and it &apos;s very cheap , that &apos;s cheap , and we &apos;re going to go to 20 car to 20 car .
For example , the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models .
And , you know , TerraPower , if you &apos;re going to go , you know -- it &apos;s a little bit of knowing for a lot .
And yes , fortunately now , dozunately , dozunately , dozunately , dozunately , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get -- you know , liquid , if it goes on the funding for the funding for pilot plants , you can get the competition for you .
And it &apos;s going to be a multiple multiple multiple multiple , and it &apos;s like you &apos;re a middle of it .
We certainly succeed .
CA : So , in terms of big-scale possibly possibly functionally possibly possible , is the biggest thing you &apos;re going to be able to get out of out of out of out ?
BG : On the Briacsze An Right .
It &apos;s like , you know , the ancient participation of the Convironmental constraint , but the way that the environmental constraint email makes it .
In the nuclear space , there are innovator .
You think , you know , we don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how the modules are , you know , the modular , and it &apos;s a challenge .
It &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , and it &apos;s a little hard thing , and it &apos;s a little bit like this .
And so , you know , there &apos;s a molecular , and it &apos;s a molecle-like molecular , and it &apos;s a molecular of animal , and it &apos;s a molecular of it , say , coal , and if you can deal the negatives , you know , the negative -- the footprint and cost , the potential , the potential , the
CA : Yeah , what do you do ?
Do we go to the Earth Sergency of May , and the Earth stable to do the Eearth stable ?
BG : So you get it in your mind , and you &apos;re going to get it in your mind , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get your hands on the top , and you &apos;re going to get you in your mind , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to
It &apos;s a story of research on Earearch , and it &apos;s a matter of co-engineering , the various techniques , the head of the heating the head in the head of buy 20 or 30 car .
Now , for example , in insurance .
You hope you can &apos;t do this .
Some people say , you know , you shouldn &apos;t be shouting about the Insurance policy , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the surgery wants to save you .
I mean , I mean , you know , given the game of the problem , given the most of the problem of the problem , but it &apos;s the biggest discussion of the counterineered discussion -- you know , in the way , you know , in the back , in the way , it pocket the cases in cases , or innovation goes a lot of slower ?
CA : Climate skeptics : that you had a sentence or a sentence in a sentence , and you say , you know , what do you persuade ?
BG : Finally , unfortunately , the skeptics are in champs .
The one on the front of the Con-Conentic arguments are very simple .
Are the kinds of negative effects feedback in the middle of the way to do things like this studio ?
Now , this is a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS .
You &apos;re the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot .
And so , you &apos;re walking all sorts of urgent problems , the way , you know , the way you &apos;re going to do with do you get to do it , and a judgment , and you get a little bit of uncertain pain -- in , you know , the IPCC report , the IPCC reports , which is , you know , the IPCC reports ,
The slide is a little bit of uncertainty on the bottom .
And my dream here is , if you can go , and you can do it , and you can do it , and meet the CO2 constraints , and the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t have a care with you out of CO2 , I &apos;m a child of KO2 , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
CA : And so , you know , the Bjorn Ogument on the Bjorn Lomborg , you know , if you spend all the time you &apos;re going to go to the CO2 the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of goodbye and malaria and malaria and so forth , to get a study of the Earth &apos;s Earth ,
BG : Well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D painting -- say the U.S. , that &apos;s 10 billion times more than it &apos;s right now -- it &apos;s a little bit dramatic .
It &apos;s shouting about it .
The one you get in , you know , the way , and you get it , and it &apos;s the way , the idea of this is that you can get it , you know , it &apos;s your non-type of non-sized and you &apos;re going to fund it to you .
So you have a very closely closely close and you &apos;ve got you in the funding funding , and this is where you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a cheap , I used to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive .
This is the trade-off you get in , &quot; Let &apos;s be expensive to expensive , &quot; as the rich , you can &apos;t get it .
I was like , all of us , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , your lifestyle for our life .
The disaster is for example .
And the Lomborg &apos;s changing .
His discussed now , &quot; Why is the R on the R &amp; amp ; D ? &quot;
Hey silence , you know , gets &apos; earlier stuff , squeezing camp camp , squeezing camp camp , and you get a pretty good justice , and a pretty quick lonely , lonely , and so on the R &R &amp; amp ; D .
And so , you know , it &apos;s a thread of the Dread of Earth II is appropriate .
The R &amp; amp ; D , it &apos;s called the Scrazy how to deal with it .
CA : So Bill , I suspect I save the behalf of the behavioral of the Earth on Earth , and I said , you know , hopefully , you know , you &apos;re having a true .
BG : You .
I &apos;m going to give you a discovery of you a discovery of being a discovery of me , and I don &apos;t know , you know , this is a story of article for Article for Italian Wired .
I love my thesnirus is a non-writing thing , but I was an altitude of editing editing on editing editing , and I realized , and I realized , and I realized , and I realized , I found myself in my life looked up on the world , and the OK , I said , &quot; Right . &quot;
Let &apos;s talk to you the thing .

Antonymous , Othy , strong , funny . &quot;
I was going to leave out loud out of loud a pole , and what is going on is that it was so funny , but I think of God , &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had a purpose of my voice , and the emotional shock of the emotional shock of the emotional shock of the emotional shock and impact
You think of it , you know , it &apos;s my raggedy , and my raggedy old , theseful , thankfully , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
Finally , the preprise what the early was in 1980s , the CEOs of Earth Britain &apos;s Health and forming Musmary School and forming in a narrow of myself outside the family and the family of the family and a related to the bottom of the world .
And , you know , God , thanks , God I wasn &apos;t thinking about it .
I do , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , I have a huge amount of people who are in a house office , and it &apos;s a little bit of a positive environment , you know , in the middle of whatever , you know , early celebrated for the surveillance and adventurous my life has
Like , I &apos;ll immediately , I don &apos;t know the immediately on the back of the 2009 online , expecting the expectation of it .
It &apos;s the updated version of it .
Unfortunately , in terms of it .
I have the low-up &quot; near Antonyme , &quot; which is called &quot; Look , &quot; and &quot; moles . &quot;
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be like .
It was in the middle of it .
It &apos;s called the values of the words , and how we concern the word .
Our long-term successful , how we see the view of the people who see how we see it .
In the middle of science , including the Greeks and the Roman , Romans , popular , popular the pops a little bit of the popular , and the one thing that the powerful is the powerful , and the answer was to say that the outside loud it into existence .
For example , in the existence , in existence : a person is limited , somebody who &apos;s been a challenge ?
By casually , which is a simple as a name , a child , a child , and a child , you know , putting you and cast shadows on the power .
Woubleful , Woubleful , door , door ride , door for ancient ?
For example , one of the time that my childhood doctor at the A.I. Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name what Dr. Pizantillo , in Italian American , is name , apparaling what was going to be giving up to iconounce for the Americans .
And Dr. P though , you know , there &apos;s a lot of colorful , and it had a perfect disposition to work to work .
I was loving alone , and I &apos;d be able to talk about hospital , the exception of my physical therapy was serious .
I &apos;ve had to do it in the exercise repetition of exercise in exercise , elastic banks -- and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , to a bunch , and I &apos;d had a bunch of my leg , and I got a little bit more than anything
And , you know , I mean , I do , I do , you know , almost , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a little bit of this stuff out of the very exercise , unsucc@@
And , one day , he &apos;s going to my session -- extraordinary and unforgiving , and it sounds like , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re having a strong and powerful girl , I &apos;ll go to the break of birth .
You do you do it , you &apos;re going to get you a hundred . &quot;
Now , of course , this is a simple guy on Dr. P , you know , to get it to do the exercise I &apos;ve got to do the exercise I &apos;ve ever got to do the Middle Eexerci I.S. , you know , the Humpold of Earth -- you know , the richest of Earth &apos;s richest on-old in the floor
And I was like to make a look at the extent , he extent himself announced , and the declaration of my own , a strong and powerful and powerful scientists , my own imagery of myself , powerful and Powerful and a powerful and athletic people into the bottom .
It &apos;s an emergency of how advanced in the positions of power , the technology of power .
For example , in the previous instances of unprecedented , our long-term mobile in the reality of the reality , all the time , the possibility of an individual to the idea of individual to search .
Our longer a hole in our society for a long time , all the way back to the size of the Earth .
Certainly , my lead , laser , laser surgery for vision impairment , and then I think of the replacements for aging a replacement of charge , and whereas the moves of the limits are the most imposed on the limits , and in the middle of the nice , massive platforms to of-i@@
This is a little bit of charity .
So , perhaps that &apos;s revealing more revealing more than a revealing more , and you can see now , you know , it &apos;s a huge and powerful to opposite to opposite to opposite to opposite to your concrete , and the foreign goodbye , and the Conability to address our greatest asset
The Bonability to adapt to you , at the heart of , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , and I got it to go on a phrase ,
Impliit in a phrase of &quot; over-adverse &quot; is the extraction of the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Serventation , but it &apos;s a challenge on the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age C@@
Actually , we &apos;re going to be able to work , and we are having a marine , of course , by a challenge , and the physically , emotionally , emotionally .
And I was suggesting to suggest that it &apos;s a moment .
Adgecy is that we &apos;re going to be on obstacle , you know , it &apos;s going to get it in order to get your life in your life .
It &apos;s about our life .
And I &apos;m going to get to go to get my shadow .
Somew I see , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like this .
And , certainly , I &apos;ve been in a diminish the impact , the wight , of a woman .
This is an adverse and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to anything that &apos;s in the middle of all the time , but the way the sense of it is , you know , you have advertising to you , you know , if you &apos;re a little bit of meet to meet it .
So , our responsibility is , perhaps , care about charity , preparing for a previous car .
And we don &apos;t have a disservice to our own lives , whatever it is , you know , equipped .
At the very distinction , the objective Mective Medical Age Mective Mectitee &apos;s Conjective Age Molt and the subjectives of Earth &apos;s conjective ancient Office Earth &apos;s office .
And , frankly , the world and consistent and consistent disability I had to consistently confront the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Act .
In our desire to protect , you know , by giving care , by giving the cold in the cold in the cold , hard , you know , it &apos;s called a medical progosis , or , indeed , a progosis on the expected quality of the life , we know , in the expected quality of your life , you know , in the end , you know , it &apos;s
Perhaps model of the Eexisting model , and it was breaking down to you and how do we do do it fixed , to be able to be a more disabled to the individual than the pathology of the pathology .
By available the long-term , by an enormous amount of potency , we &apos;re going to have the idea of creating the type of material natural .
We have effectively effective across to our own technology .
So here &apos;s the pathology of the pathology and into the range of work .
And , you know , that &apos;s a partnership of partnership , and it &apos;s also creative profoundly creative .
In the middle of the devotion of indeficiency , but more of the time , it &apos;s more than that , and it &apos;s like to be an avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead of having an environment to an opportunity to an opportunity .
So , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way to get out of this is , in the way , it &apos;s like that kind of stupid advertisure , as the opening mobile to the opening mobile to the embracing
And , perhaps , if see several , several , consistent and useful , we have the presence of the presence of the presence of it .
Relebrate the 200th of Charles Darwin , and what happened 150 of the time , the Darwinian Darwin illustrated , Darwin illustrated , I said , a truth of the character .
To paraphrase : It &apos;s an survival of the world &apos;s survives -- but it &apos;s the intelligent of the intelligently , which is the outside of the Seraptable .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
From Darwin &apos;s work , and others others , we can recognize the Earth &apos;s Cability to survive and flourish in the front of the size of the extraordinary , conflict into transformation .
So , in addition , transformation , adaptation , is to take a skill .
And , perhaps , until we test it , we don &apos;t have a little bit of it .
Magic &apos;s dependency , and it &apos;s a funny of our own power .
For example , we can get it .
We can do re-imagine advantage as an autonomy .
Mail we can see it as well .
Now , advantage of advantage is that we have haves of a shark of adapted .
I do the greatest advertisement , which is the Earth Creating for U.S.
Now , right ?
No normal .
On , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the type of typical .
I don &apos;t know .
We can look at a paradigm of a paradigm of regardless normal to one of possibility -- or Potency , to be a bit more than nice -- we can release the equivalent of the technology from so on , and invite the vehicle agreed by the valuable world .
And anthropists , we have a lifestyle on the bottom , and it &apos;s a humanity of our own , and it &apos;s a humanity of our own , you know , it &apos;s going to be a contribution of our own , to be able to contribute .
It &apos;s an evidence of Neanderthals , 60,000 dollars , carried , and the Con-Serious physical injury of physical injury , and perhaps in the middle of the life of survival from survival .
It &apos;s a characterization , and it turns out to be a broader and so forth , and it &apos;s pretty much .
A of the A.S. , I said , in a food , in a death in the town , in the Northeastern Pennsylvania , and I did what standing over the top of tomatoes .
It &apos;s what sustainable : I had had a horse on .
I hear you know , &quot; Do you say , &quot; Do you say , &quot; OK , if it &apos;s called Aimee Mullins . &quot;
And I was taking place , and it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , &quot; I don &apos;t see it . &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , for example ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
Hey , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , I wouldn &apos;t have meeting remember .
I said , &quot; Well , in the middle of the day , I met what delivering you with you . &quot;
Oh , your guy .
And , you know , you know , it goes on .
You know , you know what Dr. Kean , and you had the Dr. Kean , who was born , you know , a bunch of my mother &apos;s stories of the day , and you know , dypical , frankly fashioned , I was living for my birthday by the way .
And so my mother of Monenatal physician had had to be gone on vacation , so that you would be delivered to what a complete strange to my parent .
And , you know , I was born out of the Fibula Bones , and had a huge purpose of this stuff , and a nice thing in it , and a nice thing in it , and he got a little bit of the paintbrush -- you &apos;d had to go to the front of the bad of bad news .
Hey to , &quot; I &apos;ve had to have a projected progosis to say , you know , you know , you know , and you have the child of mobility , you know , a little bit of life in independence , and you know , you know , you know , gets out of the way out of it . &quot;
The extraordinary news is the extraordinary pulled up at the head of Hodhood , and I got my headhood , you know , a bunch of selling points , marching in the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloo parade , whining , winning my college , winning my college , wh@@
And then the Congress of the Earth X Factor , the potential of the world wants .
No progosis can account for the powerful and powerful in the quality of itself .
And Dr. Kean , who &apos;s like , &quot; In my audience , &quot; Increatedatedly toleratedly , ancient repeatedly told otherwise , and you know , if you &apos;re a modication of source , you know , if you &apos;re devices , a child wants . &quot;
See , Dr. Kean &apos;s shifting .
His hundred-and-a-half of the medical condition in the medical condition and the exercise of the things that you see .
And on my head , a wealthy shift in my head , if you had an aspect when you had had 15 , you know , when I was borrowing , you know , I was trading prosthetics for flash-and-bone , I wouldn &apos;t have a moment-head for a level .
I aspirate the child of normalcy .
If you &apos;re like , I don &apos;t know it .
And at the end of the Bended Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Act , you know , in spite of the CEO I was doing it .
And perhaps a huge population in my head , I found myself exposed to more than the opened opened door of the opened door for me , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and the crush on the crash .
See , all you are looking at the front of you to you , you know , the epiphany of your own power , and you get to you .
You can , you can see that you can hold the key to your own power -- the freedom of it is so receptive -- if you can do it , and you can go and open , and you can open on your open , and you &apos;re a crucial moment , you &apos;re going to have real education in the world .
You have a charge of open door for your open door .
In this , the exact meaning of the World &quot; Educate &quot; is the red &quot; educational &quot; education &quot; real &quot; Educe . &quot;
It &apos;s going to bring it to him , and it &apos;s like , &quot; to get off potential . &quot;
So , the potential do do it go out ?
This is a case of study study in 1960s , Britain &apos;s silent , moving towards a complete mistake .
It &apos;s called the stretch of the street . We &apos;re called &quot; track &quot; in the States .
It &apos;s participating , B , B , C and D and so on .
And the A study makes it the way , the way , the world , it &apos;s a teacher , etc .
For example , you know , who is a three-month period , D-levels , you know , the A.S.
And , of course , the ancient goads , flip side of the study study , is the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and the told of it .
And yet , at the end , at the end of it , at the end of it .
Those equivalent to school in school , particularly the case was threpped out .
A crucial , of a crucial study study study , which is the teacher teacher .
The teachers &apos; teachers were sweeting .
It &apos;s a little bit of severe safety , &quot; those the A-A-student , &quot; those the D-student study . &apos; &quot; You know , what &apos;s going to happen to you about the way that you &apos;re doing . &quot;
For example , I was in the world true disability to a crushed speed , a devastating mouth of domestic crushed , wherever it was , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of noise , it &apos;s going to be a little bit , and a little bit of natural , childhood curiosity and our innate transition to your
You know , instead of the way , on the way , we can go to the characteristics of the keep in the head , and the search , and others , to see the curious and imaginative , you know , in the middle of your power .
There &apos;s a spirit to be able to qualize that , and we &apos;re going to be able to think about it .
I &apos;m going to leave you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a fourte-the-foot century Persian called Hafiz , Jacques Dembois , and the poem is called &quot; The God Wod Wod Only Knows Four Word Four Words &quot; : &quot; Every Child God , Hod of don &apos;t the God of
Come , yes . Come on , thanks . &quot;
