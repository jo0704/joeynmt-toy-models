Several layer, TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow.
And the very pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple: teams of the Middle At the test standing up the talling of the test in 20 sticks of spaghetti, and one yard of tape, on-yard of Sting and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow hand is to be.
And, in fact, it's a simple thing, and it's hard to pretty much definitely whether it's a little bit of collaborative on collaborate.
And so I think about what was going on, and I incorporated it into a design shop.
And so what a huge is looking for.
And then, you know, I'm spending 70 designs in 70 design, and I designed and designers and architects, the CTOs of the Fortune's 50, and the CEO of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortune of the Fortun@@
So, normally, it's taken by orienting themselves in the world.
First of all, characteristics out of the way they look at it.
There's a lot of planning planning, organizing, sketch on the spaghetti.
This is the majority of the majority of chembling the sticks into ever-sized.
And then finally, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, like, you know, outside the marshmallow, and it turns out to be like, and it turns out to be like, and it was standing, and it was a day, and it was a day.
On the heart of the day, it's called the "tye" and "Tuh-oh" "Congo of the marshmallow circuit" collapse and collapse.
So, as you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, a lot of stuff like that, you know, it's a lot of "uh-oh" moment, and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates.
OK, so, you know, you know, cheat, the map of districted and so forth.
And of course, of course, technically teams of people who are going on, and it's like, "tac-da" worth, and among the absolutely recent graduate.
And it was amazing.
At Peter tells us, perhaps, you know, you know, you know, pretty much, you know, pretty much, you know, what's going to be done is the most important thing in the world.
So the bottom line: is that? Why? What is it?
And Peter likes to say, you know, you know, none of the Men of the PEOs, you know, CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
It's not a little bit of jucky power.
You know, it's like, you know, it's going to be a well.
And the reason is a bunch of business, trained in the middle of the Earth right, right?
And the execute on it.
And the way is, it's the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top, and it's a little bit out of it.
It was a crisis.
Right? Right.
What major do differentiate is called the marshmallow, and a sharing prototype, successive prototype, checing the marshmallow, white multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way.
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project.
And then, rather version, they get strong feedback, and that's what they do.
So the thing in prototyping with a prototype is essential, and let's take a look at what's going on.
So the average for the average is, you know, in the average, by 20 inches -- business schools, a half of them; lawyer, a purpose, you know, instead of being, you know, a down-advanced station, even three-distant, funny, evidence.
Who does this matter?
Architect and engineer, thanky.
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world.
And so on, you know, it's going to be the potential and self-cleanly geetetrical powered geetrical patterns in the world.
So CEOs, a piece of that CEOs, a little bit of an average, and it's coming up with that.
You put you on executive adminances on the team, the significantly.
It's called you. You know, you're going to go, you go, you go, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Win the way."
You can be conscious. You can get it.
It's a little bit of skills of divertation.
Sometimes the project is the project.
And whatever, you know, team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team.
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong.
You know, you're having typically a type of typical performance, you're going to get you, you know, you get some kind of thing that you're doing, you know, it's the way that you have, you know, it's kind of like this.
And I tried.
I do, let's go once.
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning.
So, how do you know, how do you get to be done with a design definition of design?
What about the world?
And he said, "No one team had had a standing in a standing.
Now, anyone had a piece of sharing, say, "On one in the middle of the world, the price of the brain.
Like, isn't it? However stacking, staces, staces, stacks impact.
We arrived at the exercise on the exercise.
What do you do?
So now, the value of prototyping.
So this is the bottom of the very, very much, the very way to do the same thing in the world.
You know, the tallest of it in the least is in the least amounts.
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a marshmallow, you know, you're a marshmallow?
And the reason is that I have a process of processing tools and processed into the process of taking video games and visual effects.
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day.
Frankly, frankly, the project has marshmallow, but it's like?
The challenge provides provides the challenge, and a slide of a long time, a little bit of a purpose to the build the right.
And so, you know, the value of the Central of the City of the exercise.
And it's like you're going to be able to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It takes a bunch of a bunch of it, and it goes into the marshmallows.
Final by-step-by-step steps.
You know, it's a little bit of crazy fuzy, you know, it's the kind of thing that's going to be like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be an advertising system.
You know, there's an autonomous type of people who are there.
And the fundamental lesson, I think, is a design, design is a contact.
It demands on it, and it goes all of our head to the top, and it goes up the very all of our own, our fellow, our fellow and our case to the challenge.
And, you know, a prototype of Earth's prototype, you know, it's all the way to turn it into a two-oh type of moment to a nuh-oh.
And that's a little bit differently.
All right.
Let's move forward right now.
A more machine, a cool, TEDish machine, and it machine, it machine.
And you put it in the way to get it into it.
And you can go, you can go goods, you can go forwards; you can't have you.
And I wonder, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was boreful, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, you know, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and you know, all the way to go to
I don't know, I'm going to go to go to go to go back and Twitter, or Twitter, "American Idol."
I don't know.
I was Convinced, of course, of pull to nostalgia, to knowing you.
And I do.
I mean, I said, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say."
I don't have to go to go back, and it's called an adventurous way.
It's offering the possibilities of being planet to be planet, and it's like, you know, it's going to be done, you know, Congo.
As I do to get it in the machine, and I graduated from Gochine.
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the case, and it's based on the case, by the planet, by whatever messy, you know, to choose, and Walth, mobility, denial, declining rates of disease...
It was a matter of mind.
My great-graded participation, all of the story, by the power of 60.
My grandparents pushed 70.
My participation of my participants are wrong in 80.
This is how the beginning of my death was the beginning of my death.
After all, it's a bigger, and it's a bigger deal.
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi, excited to live Earth's lichest in the world, in the middle 100, you're born.
Think, you know, it's going to be done for that.
And does it happen?
Smallpox. Smallpox kiled billions of work on the planet.
It reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way.
It's called it. It's a Dvanished.
We vanquish it. Puff.
For example, in the same time, threatened millions of us there is no longer, hardly.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio...
Do you see anyone in your mind?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to be fed billions of stuff, the Tentific of the Center method.
And to my mind, the Cententific method -- stuff out out, searched if it works on, is one of the Saccomplishments of humanity.
That's the way we look at it.
Infortunately, it's all the way news, and it's going to be a little bit problems, and it turns out to be done.
And one of the story is that all our accomplished all our accomplishments, a trillion of goes to get to get hongry in your head.
You know, it's called the rising, and it's a very rapidly rapidly, and it's very rapidly.
And, you know, that's where our imagination to honor thoroughly drash.
Potal water, Arabland, rainforests, oil, gas, it's like, you know, it's in the middle of it, and it's in the middle of it, and innovate and innovate, innovate in the way out, you know.
So the thing is, Can we do? And I can do it.
I mean it was clear to be able to do it, I want to get food, it wants to be a little bit of billions of the Earth, and it goes into the country, and it's listening to the country.
I like to do that, the destroy of power, destroy.
I do it, and I don't know it's going to be in the way.
Every one of the Earth keeps coming up with the Earth keeps up, and one of the Earth keeps going up with night: We're going to be progress in Conence more than that right now.
And so, you know, it's going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can.
We have the verge of amazing, and yet I've gone to go to go to go to go back to go, 300 people, the Enlightenment, to the British Age Age Age Congress, who was going to be a little bit of the progress, and let's be farmed with front of the day, and on the moment, front,
Peating wrap is very popular, and so you know, it's so ugly the way you can do it.
On the audience wants to go.
And, listening, contemplated with their opinion, the Contled population of being progressed.
Do you know how to you?
You knew entirely on your own. Sorry, you know.
And I'm going to spend it up to figure out.
There's a story, I wrote a story, Vaccine for The New Yorker.
And I think it's a popular opposition: the opposition to it is, it's all of the world's effective public about it.
I do to do it, I do, like, I wrote, I wrote, I wrote, and I was a mobile.
And so, I wrote a story, I wrote a story.
Same one, more bigger.
Pew's crazy.
So I wrote a story about this story, and I was puzzling yourself, and the Frankenfoods, which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark, rather than a haphazard way, which puzzling itself, which puzzling itself.
You know, you're doing it, I do. I wrote the story, I was mobion.
I have a journalist.
We type, we're falling, we're dinner dinner. It was dead.
Right, thanthfully, I was born bothered, and I couldn't do some people out there, and eventually I do.
And in the middle of Seratics, in the middle of the mazy, whenever it's going to happen in the world.
Same amazing thoughful, educated equipment.
It's going to be exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same.
And it's going to be a little bit of it.
As I do, you know, you're honest.
We ended up in the middle of Earth, and we don't know, in the car, the relationship of relationship in the world.
We do it ambivalding.
We do it in ironic terms, "Congress."
Okay, I think that's what's going on for you, and I'm going to be able to think about it.
We got to institutions in institutions, in authority, and in terms of this stuff, and there's no idea that we shouldn't go.
You can say, "You can say," and you want to be able to do it.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass deeply, hanging.
You can do you can do you can get your choose.
Now, it's the purpose of all the way in the world, and it's a little bit of a problem, and it's a little bit of skepp.
Ask: For example, demand the first, demand evidence.
Don't do anything.
So here, you get it all the way: you're going to get a little bit, you know, you're going to get your acceptance on account.
And the reason I can say, the idea is that, in an epidemic of the epidemic of being, you know, you're in the epidemic of an image of an II.
About 12, which is a story that was published, a horrible story, a horrible story, the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Tons of stuff like this is going to be looking at seeing what's true.
For example, tons of study like this, it's serious issues.
All the way.
The bottom of the United States is called the United States, in England, Sweden, Ganada, and it's all the thing: no correlation, no one, none at all.
It's called it. It's a matter of charge, and it's called the anecdotes, we think it's the way we look at seeing it, and we're in the middle of the sea, literally we're seeing it, and it's the real thing.
We don't have a level of documents of documents, and it's a government official, and I do, I said I was doing all the things.
You know?
The results of it is an amazing thing.
Disastrous: The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs in the world's vaccine rate for measles.
It's discovery, and it's an ashamed of it.
It was horrible.
What about a child of a child?
Now now, I do. I do it.
Do you see, you know, there's some kind of maps of maps?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles?
There are very much.
Again, if you're going to, you know, downstairs, you know, it would be like, you know, it's going to be like 160,000 in the water.
A lot of death of measles -- 20.
For example, it's going to be done, and we can put it out of our minds, and you know, Jenny McCarthy can be preaching McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy Athy McCarthy McCarthy, Oprah, Oprah, "Oprah" and "Larry K@@
And the thing you can do is, you know, it's going to be able to get out of this, and it's going to be done by making correlation.
It's not very much, though, that's the bottom of the bottom.
And it goes back to that.
It's a little while, Jonas Salk.
Heap of the type of the source of some of the stuff like this.
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.
It's a bad guy in the middle, which is how much.
His name is Paul Offit.
Hey hey, a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff.
It's called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning.
Pretty, right?
After all, the Paul Paul Paul goes, you know, I'm going to go to get vaccine, and I think of it as valuable, and you know, it's going to be like this.
Here's how it goes.
So, Paul's Ana terrorist.
And Paul spaks in a public performance, it's going to be the testify machinery.
However, he asked him to go, and he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, he remembered him, and he remembered him, and he remembered him.
And hold, Do Paul was vaccine.
I don't know, I don't say, say, vaccines are essential.
You see, you know, you have a disease, you know, horrible discussion.
We human measles in the world.
And it turns out that, and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtue of it, and it's going on, and it's going to be on the front of it.
And you know, there's a huge thing to the of measles.
What does polio? Let's do it? Why?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks, and it's like, I know, I do something.
There's no one.
She switched into the vaccine, you know, a polio, no way.
Fine.
Why? Let's go on polio.
We're going to be the polio in the hyesterday.
Today, I don't know, you know, this guy is, you know, a guy in Lagos in Lagos in Lagos, and he's going to go to LAX, right now.
And then there goes up to a couple of hours in a couple of couple of hours, there's a car running a car, and then go to Long Beach, and this is a little bit of pattern TED dinner.
And then, you know, it's going to be a paralytic disease, and we're going to be paralytic disease, and we don't have anything else in the bottom of the bottom of it.
And the planet is the planet on the planet, and there's a pretty predent about it.
Now, you know, well, in the way, you know, we're going to go on to do it. We do to do it.
You know, Everyone's vitamins in the morning?
Echinacea, a type of antioxidant to get you.
I'm going to do you a half of American.
Now, the stuff of the stuff, and it's called the stuff of alternative medicine, and as a result of it, as a result of them, how many times we look at the top of it.
This is all the material.
You know, it's like that, you know, there's an old thing.
It's like, you know, you're a little billion dollars in pay 28 billion dollars in it?
I am doing you.
Right. Dark.
Why do we do? Why do we do?
For example, I was there, I was having a big charma.
We have characteristics. We don't know.
And we shouldn't go and look at the care of the stuff.
It's a cruel millions of millions.
It was absolutely astonishingly cold, and it solid souled into the cold of it.
So that's where it's like, and so forth do?
We run into the arm of Big Placebo.
It was fantastic. I do Big Placebo.
You know, you do it, you know, it's a serious one, and it's a crap, and you're billions of dollars on it.
And I heard all sorts of things like this.
No of it -- gindgo, fraud; echinacea, fraud; I don't have to get there, and so on, you know, the billions of dollars on dollars on the dollars on it -- it's fraud.
And you're talking? At you, I say, you know, I'm going to ask you, and I say, "What do you do? Let's do things like this.
It does. "
You know? You're wrong.
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if it was in the outside of HHS, "Hmm, I found myself in the E.S. on the evidence of my experts on my experts on my right," or simply, you know, scanctics quack to your patient's coffee.
You go back to this road and magic regular regularly, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You end up to Thabo Munki South Africa.
Hey killed 400,000 of his Adby Insisting, Garlic and lemon and limon is more effective, more effective, more effective than the antiretrotroviral prisoners of AIDS.
Hundreds of deaths of GDA, in a hand, is a plagued white than any of the world's disease.
Please, don't have no consequences.
It's pretty much.
Now, the version of the Middle epidemic in the middle of right now, in the middle of right, is a proponent of genetically engineered food, and the organic elite.
It's the idiotic debate. It's a stick.
It's a debate, you know, the metaphor.
It's an ideology, it's going to be done.
Every single, you know, Every single, you know, the rice of rice, the story of Parsley, the Brusss sprout a lot of you.
You're in the garden of Eden.
I wasn't going to happen in this crush, and you're going to go to christmas. We do it all.
We're on the lower 11,000.
And it goes and forth about it.
We're talking about the stuff.
Now, you can do it in a more precise way -- and there's a lot of precise, absolutely -- but we can put it on a lovely vitamin A into rice, and you can get stuff millions of times, millions of times, project lives.
You don't do anything to do?
I said, I don't know it.
We object to genetically genetically engineered.
Why do we do?
For example, the As Constantly constantly -- Too's chemicals, pestr, hormones, monoculture, we don't think of the Great Field of the Great Field.
We don't know companies patent life.
We don't have the companies of owning.
And you have my response to all of it?
Yes, you're right. Let's get free with it.
It's true, it's a huge food problem.
There's a thing to do anything about it.
It's a bunch of patent on it.
You're going to be a company.
It was indeed.
It's in the middle of it; it's a project.
It's a profit, and it's a project like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, and it's like that, but the way the background is that the thing we're doing, and whereas the thing we'd like to do that, allow the day, allow the day, and if you're a little bit of the Araid, you know, it's a very dead, and it's
You think, in the way 50, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be enough 70, you know, it's going to be -- you know, it's going to be -- you know, there's about it right now, 70.
investment in Africa over the load 30.
Disgrubful. Disgrust.
On the time, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be there.
And Right? Genetically in English.
We don't have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with, you know, I studied yourself, and we have a stupid stuff, and the cassava.
Cassava was a bunch of characteristics.
It's a child of a potato.
It's a bunch of calories. It sucks.
It's known as a protein, and it's protein, and it's a little bit of intelligence that's going on in that right now.
And then, you know, it's going to be able to be able to get there, and it could be blind.
You know, wouldn't, you know, how do you get there?
It's nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse.
And all I can say, is that the thing is: Why are we going to shape it?
I do, let's go back to this stuff: Why are we going on with shape?
Are we going to move the right?
It's literally, it's kind of like that. It's not literally.
It's intensive to be ridiculous for hormones for hormones, our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment, equivalent, sure food.
You know, it's called the Rice Krispie, which is, you know, it's a kind of keeping thing, and it's in the middle of it, and it's in the middle of it.
You know, you know?
You know, we don't know, if you get continuous acting the way, you know, it's going to be a good way to do it, and we're going to be a little bit of evil, and you're going to have a little bit of evil colonialism.
There is no way to do that in the middle of it.
It's kind of selfish, it's the way that it's going on, and it's kind of like that, and we're going to stop there.
So, as a result of the Samazingly conversation, you can say, you know, you say, "This is how you squeeze it in an amazing machinery, you know, go?"
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It stuck in the present right now, but we have a lot of amazing.
We can make a bunch machine on anyway.
We can move it on the line, and we can move it, and we'd like to move it in the middle of the day, and on the middle of the day, you know, it's going to move it.
We do it conversations, and we're going to make a car, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, that's going to get it in the machine, and we're going, and we're going, and we're going to go, and we're going to get here.
I was able to do it, and as an available I concerts, you know, it's right now.
You.
One day, Los Angeles, Steve Lopez Steve Lopez, With Along the Earth Crear Los Angeles, he's going to be able to be able to be able to have a narrow music.
And the source thing you do, you know, African-American you, charming, bomeless, playing violin.
And I got a story about you, and Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, the based on a book, which turned up to a movie in a movie, Robert Downey Jr. Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double dou@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard, he's going to get a complete ruakdown, and 30, later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve, and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond, you know, you know, you know, you know, what music heroes shape, bond, and ultimately the instrumental -- if you're a pardon, you'll get the base, you get the outside.
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, Disney Concert at Concert.
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth, symphony, and by backing and introduced.
Hey, what particularly in a jovial and gregarious way to the Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and like the Dodgers to go to the World Series, all the foreign violin passage work in the lower movement of Beethoven, Fourth Symphony.
And we had music music, and I was in email to Steve, and I said, you know, OK, and I got yours, you know, you know, Middle Nathaniel, which was going to be a violin lesson.
Now, I'm going to refer to Nathaniel refuses, you know, that's where I showed therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and Corazine, and he scar a styed for his entire life.
From now, it's a trained to a trained now, it's a very schizophrenic epic, the World of Earth's manifest themselves him, and though, disappearing for days, wandering the street of Skid Row, exposed to its head horror, and the toral of Horror of Horror
And Nathaniel, which in a state of agitation, you know, a state of agitation, which is the Walt Disney Concert, and it was a child of manic glorious glint in Hall of the eyes.
And then, kind of, invisible demand smoke, and how the poisoning him in his sleep.
And I have the Araid Araid, you know, I'm going to say, you know, you know what's going on, you know, in the middle Araid, you know, seriously what's going on in one of the state of His, and Brink's Folin Departy-Folin's Folin AK: I think, "Folin,
For example, I was playing.
And I played the Movement of the Conethoven Violin Concerto.
And as I played, I've got a huge dead, which is a profound of an ocean in Nathaniel.
It's what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceutic machine, a chemical reaction, for my plays music music, of catalyst.
And Nathaniel, manic a little bit of what transformed into a lot, a quick curiosity and grade.
And in a miracle, lifeline, at the middle of a violin and you get played by ear, certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of abundance -- birth, Tchaikovsky, Siberius.
And we have music music, Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B, the Bartók, all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the case of encyclopedic, biggest music of music, but related to, related to strange, a personal level.
Hey, you spoke to the characteristics of the characteristics of happening and a lot of hand, I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And playing music, and you had to have music, and you had a transportation of the paranoid, you disturbed the exercise of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, and ended, brilliant, Juilliard-trained.
Music is medicine. Music changes.
And for Nathaniel, music is it.
It had music allows, and it had to be a hand, and it has a husband and suspended and having a realm of creativity, in reality.
And it's an especially hit state.
And I was determining what the very sence of species.
It's really what the very reason was going to be a music, and then we're going to exist in the very fundamental core, our emotion, and all of our fundamental lens, our creativity, we don't have a shape in reality.
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves, inspiring and unita.
And for Nathaniel, he needed to brought him back into a fold of view.
The redemptive power of music bought him back to a family of family behind him, and a narrow machine, and a story of recognizing him.
And I want to get a music of God, which is the Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, which is a neighborhood that I became a name of it.
You.
Bruno Giussani: From you. Thanks.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I suspect, I rolled out of my homelounts of celelessly.
That's the pleasure.
I Jane McGonigal. I did a game designer.
I've gone online now online, and my goal for the size, and my goal for the size is to go to get it to get it to be able to see the thing in real life -- save the thing in real life in real life.
Now, I've got a plan for it, and it details convincing more, including all of you, to spend more.
Right now we sponsored a little bit of a billion-playing game.
Some of you would be like, "Hey, you know, it's a lot of perspective to play.
Magic, consider considering, considering that problems in the real way.
For example, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, the opposite is true.
Three hours of hours a week isn't a massive nearly slightly like this to the Earth.
In the middle of the day, I was born if the survival of survival the Century of Earth has been on the planet in the world, in the middle of the Earth, Bramatically.
I entered Calalculated the totally, and he asked 21 trillion hours of game.
So, at the end of a cool intuitive, I say, "Let's say," On the way, you know, it's going to be funny, poverty, funny, case, climate, global conflict, no matter, I said, "Do we go to the aspire -- you get 21 trillion hours a week, by
No. I mean, I'm serious. I do.
OK.
So, I think, the last photography pretty accepty pretty photography, and I said, well, it's very essential to the Convival of the Convival of the Earth. Truly.
It's a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano.
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming, this is a camera camera in the front of gamers.
And it's a classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you don't have a gamer, you know, you're going to be a little bit of the stuff in the photograph.
You see, you see the Earth of urgency, a purpose of it, you know, intense concentration, the deep focus on a taccling and a level of the problem.
You see you're going to be a gamer, you want to be a little bit of novels: the Crinkle of the eyes, and the Mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrow up is surprise.
It's a gamer of "epic."
Oh, you're a little bit of it.
OK, well, you know, that's the way that it goes.
In epic win is that extraordinarily positive, you had nothing to do with the possibility of it.
It's an aldyond the threshold of imagination, and you get it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a little bit of discover, you know,
This is the epic.
It's a gamer on the verge of epic.
And on the face of that, on the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the world, and the obstacle of the obstacle of the Earth century -- the amount of condition of the Earth century -- the understanding of the understanding of that, all the odds, is on the verge of epic.
Now, unfortunately, unfortunately, it's like the face of the face of the face that seems to be in this day life in the day lives in the automobile.
An At At At Life At Life.
Right? Can you see the sea? Yes. Good.
It's the "I Not Good At Life."
It's a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhook in Berkeley, California, and California, my ph.D., I wish it in the middle of it in games in real life.
And it's a problem, and it's a problem of it.
We don't think we're going to be in reality in reality, and we're going to be in this.
I don't know what's going on in search, although, although, although.
We do it in game.
So, I was able to do it in motivated to do it -- inspred and cooperate.
And on the way, you know, I think, you know, I think it's a matter of all the way, I think, by the way, you know, the Middle East Rount of Connection -- the English of the English, which is a moment of moment, the English, which is a moment of moment, the Enlikely to stic@@
And in real life, in the middle of the vehicle, whenever confront, we confront obstacles, we don't think about it.
We're overwhelmed, we double the anxior, we have a depressed, depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We're having a little bit of dumb, which is a little bit of game.
For example, I was a graduate student, I think, a graduate student.
What do you think about the impossible to the people who do you get?
Now, can we do it, and it would be done with it, and you can get a little bit of work on it.
So I looked at the World of Warcraft, which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment.
And I got notice in the middle of nowhere in online.
The Treat is an enormous one of you show me, and this is a pecially on the World of Warcraft, which is the pecially least lots of character to character, you know, telling you a little bit mission, right now.
Finally, it was mission, but it was a version of a mission in the middle of it.
Right? So you can do it.
You have a challenge you can do it.
With the version of it, it's a very definition of the kind of thing that you're talking about.
And there's no insucyment in World of Warcraft; no searching, wrying, whinging, the series of the Sific and a half.
So this is the tons of collaborator.
So, wherever you get, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in the middle of the story.
Eventually, in real life, in real life, which is our fingertips, and it's our fingertips in collaborator.
And the epic story, inspiring the story of the front of the front, and it goes up, and we get all the positive feedback.
You're looking at your life, OK, and you're a strength, + 1 intelligence.
We don't eat the child of constant feeding in real life.
Actually, I'm going to get there, I mean, I don't know, you know, a moment, and you know, a crazy.
I don't have the feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with a collaborative online, the World of Warcraft is that it's so pleasant to be the levels of this on the verge of the movement of epic, in epics of epics all the time, decide to spend all our brains.
It's a reality of reality.
So, by the way, collectively all the World of Warcraft, you spent 5.93 to the virtual problems of Ashoth.
Now, for example, it's a bathroom.
It's walking with a bathroom.
Along the context of context, 5.93 in the context: 5.93.
This is what the Pupright primate.
So, as you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, the way it's going to happen to be a little investing in plain investing in a plain, the way to do it, the way it does to get the car to do it is to get the magnitude itself the magnitude of evolution, which is to extraordinary.
So what's happened is that it's going to be done by taking cross-lazy playing all the time, and it goes into the case, and it goes into the field of it, and we're going to be able to do it in the front of the time.
We trained to be a more collaborative and it's about it.
It's true. I do.
So, considers of the statistic, it was a statistic; it was a research at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young one, and he was a silent camera, you know, it would be 10,000 hours, you want to spend 10,000 hours.
Now, 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time.
First of all, for example in the United States, 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school, to be a little bit of graduation -- high school graduation, if you have a perfect breathing.
So, we're having a parallel track of education, and that's where we're going to be able to do it in a direction, and it's a low-to-day, and it's a low-camorated vehicle.
Some of you are Great Rad Malcolm Gladwell, who's called "Outlier," which is how you have a theory of "10,000 hours" theory. "
It's based on a cognitive type of cognitive research -- if we can get 10,000 hours of effortly, you know, anybody at the age of 21, you want to be virtuosos.
We want to be able to do it, and we want to do it, do you do it.
And so, now, now in the middle of it, it was an entire generation of young virtuoso.
It's like, "What exactly are that?"
So, if you're going to, you know, it's a viral unprecedented unprecedented.
This is what's going on in the world, and it's a day playing a day.
Consider virtuoso, 500 people have extraordinarily.
And in the case, in the case, in the car, the reports of the time, the most extraordinarily addressed.
You don't do anything like this.
The game industry, the game industry is the way we're going to be able to do it, and the effectiveness phone in the phone of the badband of broadband Internet, so it goes all over the world, the Bracil, Bracil, can get it online.
This is the size of the Earth Earth.
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion.
As a result, I said, "I think," OK, "I think it was virtuosos.
You know, that's the way that the world I'm doing, is that the mobile optimism.
OK, yours like this extreme self-motivation.
So, urgent optimism is the desire to identificate the image of an immediately, co-ball, combined population in the middle of it, which is a hopeful bias.
Gamers who have been done at epic win is that it's possible, and it's like, and so on, and it's now.
Gamers don't think about it.
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time.
There's a lot of stuff that's happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows, and it's a game, and it's a game.
And the reason is, it's a huge amount of trouble to play.
We want to think about it, and we're going to be a little bit of a bunch, and it wants to be a bunch of pules, value the anti-governance, which is the puzzle.
And so, plaza's game, bonds and cooperation.
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships.
Blissful: I do it.
You think, you know, at the average World of Warcraft games, you're going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half of a half a table.
It's the way that it was going to be a game, and it goes behind it, and so forth, the beautiful animal is going to be a little bit of hard than we are in relaxing relaxy, or hanging out.
We think we're going to have optimized as a result, to do, to do things hard and meaningful work.
And gamers are going to be hard work at work, whether it's the right thing to work on the right.
Finally: epic meaning.
Gamers's joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales.
So, by the way, it's a little bit of trivia, and you get it in personal, you know, you know, you all have Wikipedia, bigger wild in the way.
Second biggest voice in the bottom, which is the World of Warcraft.
Rive taking a little bit of time.
Now, compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody's topic covered anything in the world.
It's pretty much about epic.
This is the World of Warcraft's World of Warcraft.
OK, so, as well, it's going to be a power-power-power-powered, you know, Gamers are going to be super-powerful hopeful.
That's not the case of individually, individually, individually in the world.
And the bottom of the problem is, you know, the thing that you have is that, you know, there's an environmental problem of changing virtual virtual, and the real thing.
For example, the problem of the problem with the world.
This is what was called Edward Castronova.
His work is brilliant.
Hey looks at the end, the investment of that invested in the first place so that it was so, and that's what's going on in online.
And then, "We suspect," We're going to go to the mobile phounts of neighborhoods that exode virtually into virtual and online. "
And then, you know, it's kind of like that.
And then, you know, you know, you know, I'm going to be designed, I'm going to be designer; I'm exuberant.
For example, there's a perfect thing that's perfect in the middle of the Earth, which is going to be done in online in real life, and you can get it in real life.
It's a non-threshold of relationship of relationship in games, you know, you can get it in real life; it's coming up with a feedback and a half more in real life in real life.
So, for now, for now, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfectly more than virtual words, than the real.
Now now, I was rational, for now.
Finally, by whatever it is, you know, situation.
We car about the real work, which is a game.
I am inspiration, I think, is 2,500.
Conethesis, I don't know, you know, a little bit of sheep about sheep, you know.
At the time, we had an awesome, "we had had a sheep, you know.
And the very curious equipment of the case of equipment designed in the middle of equipment, and if you had a familiar with the ancient Greek of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus, you know, you know, the story of that, you know, it's the history of an invented.
Herodotus deployed, you know, Guarly divented in the Kingdom of Lydia, who was allowed a major of famine.
Apparants, which is a severe family of the Health of Lydia decide, to do it.
Pech iteration suffering. Pew quick.
It's in extreme situation, and it's extremely solution.
So, according to herodotus, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you get a bunch of chingdomic policy: On one day, you know, and on the front, and on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way.
And then, you know, there's so immerent in playing the dice, you know, that kind of games are so indeed, and rather than crushing, in terms of satisflish, in terms of evidence, in terms of ignore, and you know, ignore the bottom of the stuff had no equivalent to it.
And then on the one day, it goes down, and on the bottom, and on the way, it was on the one day.
And according to herodotus, and it passed 18 across, surviving the morning, by eating on the one day, and play games on the bottom.
Now, you know, this is exactly, you know, how do it happen.
We have gone to essentially real-puffering -- we went to get rid of all the way to get there in the real environment, in the real environment, the world's environment, and whatever savings real life, and literally, we know, it's going on.
On the way, you know, it's going to be a little bit.
It's an exciting thing.
According to herodotus, in 18 cases the name, is that the science of the science is a very decious divide.
Divide the entire cingdom.
It was a divided, and the winner of the winner of the Country to go on to the epic adventure.
You know, Lydia, and you know, Bydia, you know, in search of search, you know, go to the survival of survival in the resources, and Hopefully to the Scivilization of it.
Now, it's okay, crazy, right?
For example, DNA evidence is a showing up the Etruscans, and the way, the way, to the Roman Empire, the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians.
And so, recently, accumulated the herodotus of Modotus's office.
And of course, this is a global cool of a global cool, cool plasted for nearly 20, which is explained the family.
This is what's happening to be true.
Now, the type of sanitary culture of plain games, essentially games for 18, and it's kind of like inspred, and you're going to tell you how to get the series of domestic, you know, the environmental civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're doing plays of plays. We're going since 1994.
It's the World of Warcraft the World of Warcraft.
That's what's 16.
It's a little bit of played at 18, and we're going to play play-playing Warcraft for 16.
I say we're going to be epic for our own.
Now, it helped suggest the case of the civilization go into search, so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game.
Let's get a half a half-average of us to go to the agree, a day puzzling, until we're talking about it.
Now, I said, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," I don't know how do you know how to do like this? "
For example, I was devoted my work on the background, the Institute for the footprint.
We're banner in our officer in Palo Alto, and doing expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to relate to the one.
We do it in a way to predict it.
What is the car to do that.
We crashed imagine the de-case of scenario, and as we go into a reality of a reality of a reality.
We stop up to imagine the epic goodbye to the epic.
I was born to the very letter, I think, "I don't know," Do you know, "I don't know, you know," Do you know, "I don't know," Do you know, "I don't know," Do you know, "I don't know," Do you know, "I don't know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you know,
This is the World Without Oil.
We're in 2007.
According to, you know, it's an online to survive you to survive.
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you whatever you're doing, and literally, you know, live in your life, and literally, you know, live in your life, and you get rid of the real life, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I want to think about transportation is that if you're going to be highly closed, if you get river river, and you're a little bit of characterizing your life on your life, you know, what we're doing is that you're going to be a little bit of life, and then, you know, you're just going to post you, to post videos, to pick up to
We piloted piloted to 1.700 players in 2007, and we looked at the tracking of the Earth.
And I can tell you that it's a transformative.
And Noo wants to think of what's going on, and it's like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be the souosed.
In the epic adventure of epic adventure and, "We're out of oil.
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go.
Challenge yourself see how you look at the survival, "All of our player's keeping up here, and it's a little bit of life.
So for the long-term goodbye, scientific -- bigger problem in the world.
We ended up in the Institute for the Future.
And the premise what, a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet for 23.
It's super-completely supercomputer what's called the Global Extinction Awareness System.
We aspire online -- along a Jerry Bruckhomer.
You see Jerry Bruckheimer's movies, you're team -- you're looking at the astronaut, the uses, the world, the ex-convict, and all of the things like this is to save the thing.
On our game, Instead of Down, and the roam team, we said, "Everybody on the turn test, and by the funny of the function of the fall, the Age of Earth, the Earth of Earth, the Earth of Earth, the Earth of Earth, the Mall of Earth, Earth, the
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of dying on it.
For example, 500 insanely creative problems of you can go online, and Google "superpower," and seems.
So, finally, the load, we enjoyed runching March 3rd.
You want to complete the same thing, you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator, class of 2010.
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa, and we're going to do very inviting innovation in that.
We're having a graphic board, we're having a graphic legal living in skills in skills, whatever, biggest, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
I'm going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you, whatever it is, you know, in the way, you know anything in the way, you know, in the way, you know, in the way, you know, in the way, you know, OK in the U.K., you know, the way, you know, the way, you know, in the same area, and
So, I'm going to walk up to you.
I do it.
What do you do?
We're having all the very amazing gamers, and we've gotten a little bit of a little bit of a child of pilots, and it's a little bit of pilots, and that's what's called the real thing.
I want you to do you want to get it, you know, they're going to be a resource, you know, it's resource, you know, it can be a resource, you know, it can be a powerful platform for powerful platform.
We're going to be a power-powered powers: Blissly activity, the ability to Wave a tight pabric, random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I'm going to hope in the middle of a time to go to a game, which is to survive on the planet for the survival of Earth.
You know, my hope, you know, you want to get join.
And I think I can go to the size of the Earth, I know, I think it's a CEO for sure, and I can say, well, we can do it, and we can imagine it, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and we can go, and I can say, "Let's start the" following. "
You.
For example, the placebo was effect in the placebo effect, whenever you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a magicious way to go to a magician to a magician to a magic thing, and you do it in the bottom, you know, it's like, you know, "Some@@
There's a measurable effect of effect in certain kinds of stuff, the placebo effect, which is the study that's going to happen to be a pharmaceutical, and it's a pharmaceutical, and it's a pharmaceutical, and it's -- for pain management, for example, if it's a measurable effect in
Someforty-fake, it's a very function of the real equivalent of the Earth.
In order for us, I was taking sharks of showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic.
And I'm going to talk to you show you show you how it works. It's a puzzly-magic book, and this is the 1950s.
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s.
I do it for you, and the day I explain it.
And as I was explain, I was explained with it.
So, here's the way.
The knife, you know, you can do it.
I'm going to be hold the knife to hold the knife in my free.
I get my sleeve back.
And to get his novelty, or my sleeve I had to squeeze with squeeze my wrying right.
As you can see, it didn't seem to be able to consider anything, as you can see it, as you can see it, as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like, you know, my sleeve goop, or my sleeve.
And the object of this is very simple.
I do up to open my hand, and hopefully if all of the is well, my pure animal wants hold the knife.
By the way, you know, it's going to be so devastating in the U.S. I can shake it, and the knees in the knee.
Noo goes up at my sleeve, no trickery.
Ta-da!
So, this is a terrifying thing to do that, and it's a puzzling yourself in magic, and you can learn how to do that, you know, it's a huge amount of stuff that you're looking at here, and it's a very simple trial, but it's a very simple trick of methodology.
Probably heritage you in the world.
What does it mean.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I do to grab hold, hold of my wrapped up to his novelty, or my sleeve, and it's a lie.
The reason I encountered to the His of my wonder is the excitement of the illusion.
In a moment, my hand models of moves, you know, you know, you know, you know, the finger right here, my index finger is where you want to make a huge amount of work with a huge amount of work on it, and it's a position of pointing out there.
Nice.
Someone's club is a budhood.
For example, it's going to go, and it's like, right.
And as I love my finger, my finger shark.
And then, you know, it's heavily cheptive, you don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the mine, the mind, the mind, and the way it's a process of processing it, you're going to be able to identify,
Isn't it? Right? And back, I open my hand up.
Obvisly with the inclinging thing, which is by animal magnetic, and that by Chicanery, my index finger.
And then, I close my finger, I would say, as a living, a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger.
I was hand on. You look at the knee.
It's a trick for you can do you can do you can do it, and you can do it in an industry. Thanks.
Now, in addition to do the placebo effect?
I read a study a study, and that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, I was a doctor or a researcher, so, to me, what was the astonishing.
It turns out, you know, it turns out, you know, a placebo a placebo in the form of a mill, you know, it was called a shaped, you know, it was called a round of a round -- it's a round on it, and it's called a round on it, and it's a little bit of measural effect.
If you're in the placebo, you're going to be the placebo, you know, it's a saller pill, and color it blue, and a stump stamp on it, it's called a measurably more effective.
Even though, and Even though one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical.
There was a blue pill, which was a blue pill.
What?
Turns out, though, literally stops.
You know, you're going to be highly effective, more effective than tablets in any form.
A colored appeal to one of the study, and it's on the bottom of the slide, and it's on the bottom of the slide, and it's on the bottom of the bottom.
And there's a car to do it.
One pill is a pill of Pill, and you know, I don't know it's a statistic now.
It's the bottom...
It's the way to do it -- it's the same way to do that.
And the thing is a car to do it.
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo, you know, you can go to the needle.
Right? Actually A.S. -- a couples of CCs of this stuff, and you have a patient.
It's a powerful image to be a powerful image, and it's kind of stronger than the stronger pill.
It's a puzzle, and it's a graph, OK, OK, well, I want to show you a little bit of slides.
This is an absolutely pill, which is an actual blue pill, which is an actual blue pill, but it's an actual of the Blue Pill.
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it, and it reports that it makes a function, and it does a stronger effect.
I'm going to see if I was seeing, I was looking at my head, and I was working with a magic trick.
And then, you know, it's Ovisly a fake trick and you're living it into it.
And we're talking about the study of study that you're talking about, you go, you go, you go to the now.
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch, and it was very, very sharp, and I got rid of the purposes of sterilize with a tiny.
Actually, it's a little whistle. It's a Damian of Damian in the ial-size.
This is a Hollywood ineffect.
I'm going to push my skin and run in the bottom.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know -- I mean, you know, you know, the
So, I was suggesting to suggest you, you know, you're going to get you quickly, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I was a huge, I was a huge, I was going to be in love with this.
You're going to get you yourself, you can get your hands on your own.
So, here is the beginning of it, right here, the beginning of my mind at the lower, of my arm, I said, it was pushing.
I do, you do. Am I rave you out?
OK, and it was like, and it was a tiny, and it was a tiny, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way.
Now, essentially we are in the middle position in the world.
Sorry of.
You can get my finger with my finger right now?
So, let's show you, you know, you know, you know, you're talking about it.
Yes, well...
I've got the sea of the sea.
And we go, "Finally, in certainly dumb, you know, dumb the skin of the skin, the skin of the skin, you know, to stop entertainly, to entertate an entertagement.
For example, let me go peek.
Right? Pretty.
Yeah, I do. And the thing in the back go, "OK, I've got the sea."
Pef in the satellite and the satellite move in now.
Let's talk to you very closely.
It's my skin. It's a Hollywood ineffect.
This is my solid, and I can do it.
I'm doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, OK, OK, OK, OK.
Now, Pejin at the back, on a video chain, you want to go to go, you know, "Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Let's go up with a blood.
Yes, raise it.
Normally now, I found the needle.
I do love with my arm, and I don't know, you know, you're not going to be anywhere else.
And I was in the context of the Earth, and the foreign of the day, I was fake, and I was able to get it into the real world, and I'm going to leave the way, you know, the way, you know, the way.
I want you to be several to you, you know, I want to think about it.
I'm hoping you guys, you know, I'm going to start with you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
Again, I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life.
I do it.
From one, it's going to happen.
It's what a beautiful fish: flattered, textured, meaty, a consistent on the menu.
What a fish.
Even lives with what farm-raied to the souosed highest standards of sustainability.
This is how you do it.
I mean, in a relationship, consistent for several month.
One: One day, the head of the CEO of the Company, and I asked myself, and I saw that the farm is the farm.
"Absolutely," I do.
So, what a company do is that what's going on with this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable issues for us -- it's like, do we keep keep keep on our footprint?
For the past 50, we have the fishing of the sea in the average of the sea we have clearly clearly.
It's a hard thing to overstate the top.
Ninety's large fish, the ones we see -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmon, salmon -- collapsed.
It's called analune.
Like, for example, for example, aquaculture, fish announcing, is a car of our own.
An argue of arguments with this: Fish farm -- it's a little bit of doing anything -- and it's a little bit of ineffective. Take tuna, a major wiring.
It's a fed converting ratio of 15 to one.
After the table, pounds of pounds of farmed pounds of wild, you know, a pound of farm tuna.
It's very sustainable.
It's the most part of it.
So here, it's like, finally, what a company do to do it.
I'm borrowing off.
The day, I was the head of P.R. for the company.
Let's do it.
"I'm like," I'm like, "Where, you know," Where, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
"OK," OK. "We're so far out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way, and you're going to have a fish that's going to have a fish, and concentrated."
And of course, "We're born in the location.
Don't convert conversation ratio? 2.5 to one. "
"Best in the business."
2.5 to one, you know.
"2.5? What are you feeling?"
"Sustainable protein," OK.
"Great," I do. Go, the phone.
And, you know, I said, "What's going on, and I said," What the hell is a sustainable protein?
This is the way the way, the way, the Federal Eevent, I did Don.
I said, "Don, I mean, you know, this is a little bit of sustainable protein?"
Hey, go on. Hey.
For example, I was the phone in the company, and no one of them, it's a straight to until until, I was biology and biology.
Let's get it to you.
"I mean," You know, "I don't know," Don't you have a sustainable protein? "
For example, there's a bunch of staggery and graphic industry, and literally pellets pellets.
I am, "Chicken pellets?"
Hey, "Yeah, fade, skin, brown, scraps, drive, dried and processed into it."
I said, "What do you think about?"
Thinking you, you know.
"You know, it's going to be 30."
I was like, "Don, I'm looking for serious chicks to fish?"
It's like a pause on the line, and it's going to be like, "OK, in the world."
I fell out of this stuff like this.
No, you know, I'm doing self-righteous, goody-shoot.
I do.
No, I fell out of God, and I swear to God, people's conversation, the fish tasting chicken.
It's called a fish, and it's a little bit of a child.
It's the romantic child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the characteristics of you get it in your head, you're the fish.
I was a restaurant in southers Spain.
A journalist equivalent had had a great journalfish, and it was a patient.
She's her charge.
It goes to the table a bright, altruisted, white color.
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it.
Like twice over.
Amazingly, that's silent.
Who can do you have a fish, and it's a fish test, you know?
I can do it, you can do that.
Let's Conghim Miguel -- by his name is Miguel.
And no, it's kind of cook the fish, and it's a chef in a chef, listed in the way you and I do it.
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma.
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It was the top of the Guadalquivian river.
Until the 1980s, the farm in the Argentinians.
It's a requirement of what's sentially wealthy.
It was by dragging the country.
It's an intricate series of cancer, and it pushed the country out into the river.
For example, judgment.
And ecological, it's a disaster.
It killed 80 of the birds, and it killed, is a lot of birds.
And so in 1982, a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country.
What does it do?
It's the flow of water.
It was literally flipped the switch.
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water.
It's also floodly flood.
Now, created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the project, Miguel and company completely required the ecological.
The farm is the farm.
I do, you know, you know, you know, you know.
You're at horizon a horizon, and it's a miles, and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood, and you can't get marshland.
I mean, I have a miguel.
Hey: Hey, Charles Darwin, Crocodile Dundee.
All right? Let's look at the wealth of the web, and I was panting and sweating, smud up to my knee, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology.
For example, there's a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite.
Now, now, the mineral world, the mineral, is the mineral of phytoplankton.
And come, here, there's a pumping pattering, reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
It turns out, Miguel spent the Middle career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him, I said, "I got an expert on it."
Hey, "Oh," Fish? I suspect.
I am expert in relationship. "
And, you know, it goes up, lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants.
And no matter, you know, what's going on, you know, what's fascinating, you have the biotic, you know, the biotic visual, kind of like that.
It's okay, and I do what I do.
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of domestic I had had had the night.
As I interrupted him, I was like, "Miguel, you know, you know, fish, you know?"
His pointed at the algae.
"I mean, dude, the Algae, the phytoplankton, the relationship: It's a machine.
Are you going to be able to be able to have a fish?
What does the fed conversation ratio? "
For example, it's going to go on to go, and it's going to be a pleasant system on the planet.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's going to be the fish.
The system is so, by the way, it's pretty absolutely reneful.
It's no fed.
Ever, you know, Ever's animals are animated with it?
On the day, I do whatever, you know, I think, you know, it's like, you know, I said, "For," I said, "For a moment, you know," For a moment, you know, "For a moment, you know," For a moment, you know, "For, you know," Do you know how do you make your measure? "
So at the moment, it's like a film director for a set.
And we rounded the Rcorner, and I saw the As Age Age, which is, and it's all about pink in pink of pink flamingos, a literal pink carpet for a literal pink for an amazing thing.
"Look search."
"Look at the bottom line, pink.
It feels like that. "
Feasting? I totally conflict.
I was like, "Miguel, aren selling on your head?"
"Yes."
"We put 20 farmers of our fish and fish car to bird.
On the local, lower, period of property had 100,000 birds on it, more than 250 of them.
It's like, which is the largest private and one of the Sanctual Bird sanctuaries in all of Europe. "
I was like, "Miguel, isn't the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish?"
Hey shook his head, no.
Hey, "We farm extensively, intensive.
It's an ecological network.
The bottom is the flamingos.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
This is the pinker the pinker, the U.the. "
OK, so let's review, a farm animals fed to it, and a farm is a farm, and it's a farm at a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm of pretty preventing the way.
A fish farm, so a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, in the way, ramingos, they shouldn't be in the bottom.
Stop of dead in a town 150 miles, and the bottom is the bottom of the Soil conditions.
Every morning, is 150 miles into the farm.
And joining, it's 150 miles back.
You know, it's going to be done in the bottom of the case, the broader of a highway, you know, in highway A92.
There you go.
I mean, I imagined a "March of the Penguin," which is how I looked at Miguel.
I was like, "Miguel, do you do 150 miles to the farm, and how do you get 150 miles back?
Do you do things like this? "
Hey decrease, I had had a whitney, whitney Houston.
Hey, you know, "No, you do the food."
I was taking the Skin of my birthfish, which is delicious -- and I don't have any fish -- and I don't know, I know, I don't know how to have seared, I don't know it with crispy.
It's a type of charge.
I do so cook with it.
Yet, A.K., AI tasted with it was restaurant in his southers' Spain, and it was going to be taken off of all the stuff.
And it was sweet and clean, you know, taking a bid of the ocean.
I decided to get Miguel to Miguel.
Hey, "Oh," OK, "The skin across.
It's a defense of defense.
It's going to be relurity. "
And then, it's going to be an impurity. "
OK. A farm is a farm of it, and it was farmed at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, a farm at a farm, and it's a farm to prevent the suctice of the suctice of it.
And as I realize, "A farm in a farm in the impurities," which is a huge amount of people, and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River.
It's a huge amount of career in the world, and it's a huge way to carry with carry, and it's the chemical contaminants.
And it's going to happen to the system of the system and the water, and the water is cleaner than that.
The system is so serious about purious the water.
So, in fact, in the farm of a farm, whatever it would be animated, which is a farm to a farm of a farm at a farm, which is a farm of predator by the animals, and a farm animal literally purification purification -- and a purification farm --
It's going to be less water, it's going to be done with dumps out into the Atlantic.
A threat in the ocean, I do, you know, you know, you know, and so on, and it's like you, it's like you, you know, it's a little bit of it, and it's like, you know, it's a huge romantic, and it's inspiring.
You say, you say, this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department, which is a little bit of time, and it's like, you know, why you're having a little bit of a day.
What's going on is a radically conception of agriculture, one in Con-footing.
For a lot of people, it's a little bit radical.
We don't realize, it's foodes.
We married at the farmer market, we used to be family farmed, we were local food, we would be organic.
And you suggest that the animal is going to be heavy, and you're looking at the front of the money, and you're looking at, you know, you know, and you're up, you know, "Hey guy, I'm pink flamingos, you know, how do you want to get a little?"
Are you going to be able to get the right?
Can I be honest?
I don't know.
No, perhaps, it's all the way.
One billion people wants to get hungry.
One, one trillion -- -- you know, it's a little bit more than -- you know, it's like, you know, it's a little bit of inequalities in distribution in distribution, which is tons.
Now, I don't know, you know, the logic of the logic of our food system is the logic of our food system for the logic, for the logic of our food system.
Feed grade around, pests to monocultures, chemicals, chicken to the fish, and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect, "feding more than a cheaply cheaply cheaply, how terrible you have?"
On the motivation, it's the justification -- it's called the business of the business plan of American.
We do it with it is, a business in liquidation, a business quickly eroding ano-ecological characteristic in the world.
It's a business business, and it's a business.
Our portray-based, it's threatened, which is a matter of diminishing source, but a matter of diminishing resources.
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention, but by pumps, you know, by fresh water, and perhaps by chainsaws, you know, by foresting, and one of a fishing boat and nice, you know, by fish in the sea.
What about it?
Let's say, "Let's go ahead in the middle of" Don't go ahead? "
Or, you can see that, you can see that it's going to be conditions to have the ability to get a little bit of fun?
To do it, don't have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness.
It's called it, and it's like that, and it's all about it.
It's a matter of chemistry, chemistry and machines, and it's going to be anything like that.
Instead, let's go to the ecological model.
Finally, the one on the fabric of on-the-job.
Look to Miguel, farmer miguel.
Farmed by the bottom of the bottom, farm instead of dead instead of dependent, farming instead of extensive instead of intensive, farmers who are in charge of intensive.
For example, the one of the things that you see is that you're going to be in front of you.
And if I was to be honest, it's a chef, you know, chef as I do.
You know, I'm like, you know, I was like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, if you're a little bit of food, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be delicious.
You.
I grew up, and I was fiction.
In high school, I was a bus to school in high school.
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book, and he was a little bit fiction, and then my mind was going to be a mind of my mind, and satisfied, in a narrative form, an injectable material of curiosity self.
And you do, you know, GCuriosity's manifested in the CEOs of Lake Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I wasn't going to go in the woods, there was a day, and I was walking, "and snap and pond water -- and bringing it back
You know, I think I've gotten a real story.
After all, it's all the way around the bottom, the limits of consibility.
And my fiction of this stuff fiction with seemed mirrored in the world, whatever it was, what was going on in the late '60s, the way in the late' 60s, in the moon, we know the deep exploring the deep oceans.
Jacques Cousteau, which is, in our hour, rooms and rooms and backs and places and a wondrous environment, previously previously previously previous.
For example, it's considered to resonate the type of resonate resonate.
And I arrived.
I do it. I do, I do.
And I heard about this, and I was taking cash video, and Saturation of CG moves and all of Gimage Landscape in the Media Landscape, I was had a living in my head.
You know, we're going to see all this, as a goodbye, and the author of the authority, the author is the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to what's going to be paint to the paint of draw, and draw a creature, and you robots, spaceship, all the stuff.
I mean, you know, I'm going to go to math, doodling doodling the textbook.
This is what -- the creativity had to come out of it in the back of it.
And on the beginning, I said, "The Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary material of the very excellent material of the Earth on Earth.
I mean, I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, I was a spaceship, and I was walking in a spaceship, and it was unlikely pretty much.
I mean, you know, it's like a Sarth on Earth, right, and that's what's going on, and an exotic as anything I was doing, and I have an exercise, and I think it was books.
For example, I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15.
And the bottom issue, which is that I lived in a Canada village in Canada, 600 miles of the nearest ocean.
Actually, I love it.
I pested my father until, cuba in Buffalo, New York, right across the border of life.
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo, New York.
And I have seen the ocean, a real ocean, for example, until we liked to California.
Since, in the intervening 40, I heard about 3,000 hours of hours, and 500 hours of things like this.
And I have a great deeper of deep-ocean environment, and the shallow ocean, this is a purpose of mobile life, which is a huge amount of imagination.
Nature imagery is so official to our own own.
I squeeze it, stood in an absolute awe of the A.S.
And my officer is on the ocean on the ocean, and it's an incredibly strong as it is.
Actually, I chose a career.
And Semed to be the way to the reconception of the reconceive of the reconcension, I think I'd had to think of the answers to have a huge amount of my life.
And I do what, as a kid, Constantly code books, and so on.
So, as filming the way to put a pecking and shared it.
And of the story of the Earth, I enjoyed, fiction to, "Terminator," "Aliens" and "Aliens" and "The Abyss."
And say, "The Abyss," I think that's going to be a lot of goodbye and bumping.
So, you know, you're going to happen.
Somechnology, kind of like, "The Abyss," which is what makes car as an ific narrative problem on the head of film, in the middle of the child of liquid water, we created the embraced computer environment, CG.
And as a result of the surface, character, CG animation, which is in a movie.
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate, I say, I say, I say, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, "I say," I'm going to be amazing, and this is the audience, the audience, the global audience, which is what magic by a charge party.
You're going to have a Carthur Clarg in Lake Act Clarke, which is a Carthur Clarge, which is to be an advanced advice of indistinguism.
That's the story of all the time.
And this is the very extraordinary.
And I said, "Wow, it's all the way to go to the cinematic."
So, "Terminator 2," what my main film is we're going to be there.
To ILM, we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance on the balance.
And it turns out that, and we created created magic, and we had had the same results on audience -- although we're borrowing on the ground.
So, dramatically, by the time, dramatically, by the way, the way to go, "Don't be the car to be," and you can say, "You know, what a challenge of creativity is creativity for film.
So, I was a company of Lan Winston, my wonderful stan Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature of creatures of creatures at this time, and it was a little bit of digital domain.
And the concept of the Company, which is called the analog of the analog processing the analog processes and so on, and it goes on to where it goes on right now to digital.
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage.
After all the time, in the middle '90s, in the creature and character design in the middle' 90s, we had an amazing thing about the company.
So, I wrote, I wrote, "Avatar," which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects, of CG effects, mobile in CG, and the main character in CG, and the main character in CG, and the judgment in CG.
And the enventure pushed back, and the average, and I do what's going on by the top of the following, my company is going to be able to have to be able to do anything to do.
Like, I shelly, I shelter, and I was born, movie behind.
You know, I got it to the studio as the studio as "'Romeo and Jult' on a ship," It was a little bit of an epic romance, passionate film. "
Secrets, I'm going to go to do what I'm doing to the Earth of Titanic.
And the movie thing.
And on the audience. Now, the studio.
At I convinced, I convinced. I said, "We're going to go to the thumb. We're going to be film with it for real.
We're in the opening of the film.
It wants. It wants to be a chair of champ. "
And I enjoyed expedition.
Sounds crazy. It's a reality of this stuff that's reality, and it's reality reality.
By the time, the reality of a reality of that is a reality of search month, I got myself in a Russian Russian, and a half miles down on the North Atlantic, and the real Titanic Atlantic.
Not a movie, in HD -- for real.
Now, the problem is that my mind.
And it was a lot of preparation, and we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them.
You know, it's like, you know, how it's like, you know, it's called the thing, you know, it's called your mind, and it's the absolute deep.
You think, you know what highly technical, and it's enormous hugely planning.
You get to get you in your heavy, you go, and you're going to go, you know, you're going to have a hopeful environment with your head of rescue -- if you can get it, you can get it on your yourself.
And I was like, "Wow. I do it, living in a kind of ancient movie.
It's cool. "
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
On, the Curiosity, the Curiosity component of it -- it's what's going on. It's what adventure, it's what curiosity, which is imagination.
And it's what's called Hollywood.
I mean, you know, you know, you know, I imagine a creature, you know, a visual effect for it, and I got a visual effect for it. At I coupled, I was a visual, and I was a visual visual, I think I'd imagine what's out of the Shouse Dear.
As we got some of our sequence expeditions, I know, what was creatures at hydrothermal, and the Con-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I was thinking about it, and there was no one on the first place, and it's a little bit, and it's a little bit, and it's like that
So, I know what completely smites of it, and had to do anymore.
And so I ended up a child of curious vision.
After the search of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie, and I'm going to go to go to go."
And so on the planning, the expeditions.
And we go up to the Bismark, and the exploration of this robotic vehicle.
We went to the Titanic.
We were in the middle of the day we had had created anti-optic.
And the bottom of go to go to the survey of stuff, it had a map.
Now, Noehad had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the bottom of the car.
So, you know, you're at the now, on the now, on the Middle of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and you're looking at the plank of the planet in the middle of it, and the Council of God was there.
And I happen to be a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship.
I say, I said, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the ofall.
I have the physically present of Inside the Higpect of Titanic.
And it's kind of like the surreal child of Den-A-A-old I've done, and the AI Britain Age Age Age Age Age A.S. enjoyment corner, which is a major of the Earth of Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth Rovie Rovy Research Greve@@
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like.
For example, this is what's going on.
And with that, you know, it's like, you know, it's called the telepresence -- you know, you know, you can see it's robotic avatars, and it's like, you know, contsence your courage to be injected into the vehicent, to the error of existence.
It's something like that.
And so on a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of, you know, a little bit of a bunch of got out of the way back to the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration, and there was a post-to-@@
So, having a very expedition, and it beginning to begin with a recipitous thing about what's going on in the back, as the deep ocean ended up was amazing, and it was amazing animals -- it's right based on Earth.
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis.
And this is the survival of the survival based, which is the way we do.
And so, you know, you know, you're going to be animated, you know, living the way to water.
You're going to be a result of possibility.
At the middle of the At City, I think, that's where I was doing what's going on in space, and it's like, you know, it fiction in the world's life, influence, as a short.
And I do, I've come up with the U.N., in the middle of NASA, sitting on the NASA advic, planning actual space, to Russia, which is the pre-cosming biomedical protocols, and all very sorts of right, to the internationally, it's going to go to the International's 3D cam@@
And what fascinating.
For example, I've been doing what bringing it in the world.
And on the way, it had an acceptant -- straight, planetary, announced, demanding itself, and it's really extreme, and it's extremely environments -- tacking the way down to the vents, and there's a little bit of instrument, and so on, and so on.
So, here we have the movement of the documentary film, and that's where it's done, and it's a little bit of this thing.
I fend completely closed the loop at the time, fiction, you know, a little bit of a kid, and you know, you know, stuff.
And you, you know, along the way, along the journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of people.
Now you have a director to be a long-director, a leader, by the way of the ship, and all of the things.
I love the until of the until I have until I found extremely expeditions.
And I had myself, and he said, "What am I going to be like?
Why am I going? What do do do come out of this? "
We don't think about it.
We barely go on. We don't get rid of it.
For example, Pejacian Avatic and Avatar, and what buffing my nail is, sitting at the top.
On all the film, all the documentary film for a limited audience.
No enough, no glorious, no one. What are you?
You think about it for the table, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case environment -- for the thrill of discovery, and the thrill of discovery, and whatever bond soon is, you know, there's a huge amount of stuff.
You know, it's like, you know, it's going to be 12, 12, and so on, you know, it was a matter of sea, and a half was, you know, it was a matter of sea.
And, you know, you realize, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is, you know, the thing is the thing that you're talking about, is that you're talking about, you know, you're talking about, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And you can go back to the hore and you say, "We had to do about doing this, and the Fember optic, and the visuation, and the bottom of the fall, all the things like all the things, and the ancient performance aspects of itself," you can explain it to you. It's a material copy, but it's in commercial,
Creates a bond, created a bond of stuff.
So, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, "Avatar," you know, what "Avatar," I tried to be a great principle of leave, you know, that's where you're talking about it, and you're in charge.
And it's called the dynamic.
So, the way I did what was going on, and it was in uncharted territory, called "Avatar," which is a moment.
Tremendously exactly exciting.
Tremendly challenging.
And we became a family, family, who was a four-and-a-half.
And completely changing the way I do.
So, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go to you, you brought you back to the ocean, and put on the planet of Pandora. "
Too, it's a fundamental way of business, the projection, it's a result of it.
So, what do we do is we have synthesize out of all?
You do, you know, there's some of the things that you are doing?
It's a curiosity.
It's called the powerful.
Imagination is a very force, you know, it's a reality.
And the Earth of Earth team is more than all the things in the world.
I filmed up and say, "Give me Aadvice for you."
And I say, "There are limitations on the yourself.
You want to do it for you -- don't do anything about it to you -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be done by it.
NASA is a huge phrase: "Failure is an option."
Final to be a long way to operate in this and exploration, as a leap of faith.
And no required required innovation is what's going on.
You're going to be a willingly random job.
So, at the end of the Age AI, you know, it's kind of like you guys, is that you're in the purpose of your purpose, failure is to option, and you're having you.
I can leave you with a character, and it's a little bit of a bunch of the Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Consuit, and the Earth's Consuit of the parts of the parts, and instead of the Earth of Earth's Earth's Consupo, the Bri@@
So, at the end, on the front, this is a typical mortality.
You know, I think it's an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and he's called Pivot, and I can do Pivot, and I can do that I can choose to the filter at the bottom of death -- say, accident.
And, right, I saw, I see, it's a bunch of patterns.
It's in the middle of the area, which is where there was no active, and over the middle, and over the middle.
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death by death of death of death of death of death, and it's discussing the circulatory of the circulation of the circulation of the circulatory, and you can't suspect the usually, you know.
By ahead, we filter, and we filter -- say 40 in the middle of it -- we see 40 in the middle of this -- we see, there's an accident that's going to have to be totally overhead.
And if you're drill in, it's pecially the cash.
You know, you can see that you see the Central view, and you see it, and you can see it, is a lot of swimming in a living type of population.
You know, if we can do it for raw, you can do it for content to contend?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports's Illustrated.
It's all right; it's all the way around the world.
You can go back to your rooms and try and play my own.
With Pivot, you can drive drill into a shot.
You can go drill in a degree.
You can get jump right now into a level of hifish.
As I did, I was looking at the athletes, the athletes, there are the athletes of the Middle Age Age, which is the sports.
I am fan as Lance Armstrong, I was doing the Congo Aahead, and I graduated from it, and it's reveal, it's reveal, for example, all the stuff in the Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I was a bunch of charity of a peek, I said, "Well," I said, "Well, what's going on, does all of all of cycling?"
So I can step back, and it's expand.
And I see Greg Lemod now.
And so you get a non-navigate your non-navigate over the world, and you know, narrower, broader, backing out -- you get searching, you have browsing.
You see, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be a moment.
It's in that way, and we're going to be able to do that the way you can do it.
As a result, I do extrapolate, and it's a little bit of fuzy.
What's going to happen here is, whenever Wikipedia takes a page of, and we reduced the way down to a smary.
Like the Smary Consistation of the Smary Consistation of the U.S., you have synopsis and a topic of an indicate the topic region of the topic area.
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia.
It's in the middle of it in the middle of it.
Right, we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain, the Tikipedia.
I'm going to go to go to go.
Now, super-selected government, I can see now, of the Wikipedia, Kikipedia's frequency correspond to the Time magazine Peace of the Year.
This is the way that makes you think of an insight of insight, which contact in any Wikipedia page.
It's an possibility to see it, and it's going to be a purpose of all over the place.
And Looking at one of the paints of Looking at one of the time, you know, it's a smart, I can drive thin the Concept of Time magazines of the Year, bringing all of them.
So, by the way, I think I can get a look at the majority of the major of government; it's called a natural journey of natural; it's like, frankly quietly, you know, your business -- you know, my boss -- and on one hand, you have music music.
And so, Bono is a TED Prize winner.
This is how we can go, and you know, the TED Prize winner.
You see, you see that you see, you know, the web of the world's gnavigating the web is the way it's going to be as if it's a web, which is a web, perhaps competition, and a higher level of abstraction.
And so I'm talking to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a little bit of surprise.
I suspected the New York Times.
So Pivot, indeed -- I don't have a browser -- it's a brower; it's a browser -- it's a browser, but you can see that you can see it -- and we ring a zoomable in a case, you know.
So I can step back, pop right now in a level of sharp.
Now, the reason is that the reason is, by the way, is that, by the way, is that, by the virtue of an image pages, in a way, I can get my entire browsing history in the exact.
As I can, I think, the way I can go to the U.S.
Finally, the state of all the demo is that I was doing this.
And I can tell you, and I can talk about it, and I learned, I think, "I think," I don't think about it. "
And, if I'm standing on, I can slice all the time, I can slice all the time, perhaps by my search, perhaps by my search -- there, I know, I have a little nepotistic search searching, or Bing Bing, who is the Pivot for Live Labs Pivot.
And literally, I can drive birth to the bottom.
It's called a metaphor repressed multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right, right now, in the middle of it.
We're the movement of being overload.
We are threatening threat.
What if we can make it work down the way down the web down the web down the way, and so instead of navigating sustained, on the way, the way we can get the Earth Age Age, to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go, and the very patterns of severe of the patter@@
So, as instead of, you know, instead of being transported, you know, extract.
And, instead of dealing in dealing, we can tease out of the base out of bone.
And if you get the base of the brain, you know, it's going to be there.
So, I thank you.
Now, that's the same thing.
I had had a matter of characterization in the front of the Earth's office, "in the bottom," in the load one, and that's where the ancient region was 40, and serious.
It's a huge voice of interest in this time, in the middle of an enormous among researchers.
It's a lot of chart coaching.
Let's look at it.
On the spit of all, you know, at the spit of all the stuff of work, you know, several cognitive transports of all sorts of altruly impossibility to the right thing.
And my life wants to be mostly, it's cognitive.
It was loyal to layer-ride, and it goes to a light-up, and it goes to a behavioral, and it goes out, and it turns out that turns out to turn it into a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure.
The footprint is a reluctance to advice complexity.
It turns out, it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it turns out, and it's called a useful, and it's a little bit, and it's a little more quick.
I was taking one in the middle of Earth at the end, and it restricts, you know, by and large, and it's kind of like that, and it's the way we go, and it goes up to the car, and we're going to adopt the more complicated view of the world.
This is a confusion that's a confusion place in confusion and memory; it's based on Earth's life, and it's literally on my life.
And listening to all of this stuff, and there's a puzzle in the back of it.
And the third is the focument illusion, and it's an unfortunate unfortunate going on, you know, it's going to be a circumstance in the world.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
There's no way of doing it.
Now, I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-animal ion-and-announced, and it was an ion-and-answer session, a story, and what a story was -- Hey, a story of listening to a symphony, and it was a symphony, and it was a symphony, and it had a symph@@
And, you know, it's going to be an emotionally emotionally, ruined the thing.
From it.
What was the memories of the Conence.
Heap had had that.
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
Council places like that, and the memory, the memory, the memory, the memory, the memory, and the memory, all of the things that had had had had to keep keep going to keep keep it.
What is a telling, and it's like, is that it's like, is that it's going to be a little bit of work on it.
Finally, it's at the present, in the case, in the present of the present and bone the present, is the idea of re-living the past, and it's based a present.
It's the doctor of the doctor's doctor approaching -- you know, the doctor's doctor's doctor, "Do you have the doctor you're going to be there?"
And then, it's a remembering, and the remembering is the one of the world's keeps, and maintains the story of our life, and the doctor approaching the doctor of the doctor approaching in asking the way, "Do you have any running lately?"
or "What is going on with Albania?"
Those of you are going to be done in all the time, the Concing, and the remembering time, and the conflict source of the remembering, and it's a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that's going on.
Now, the remembering is a storyteller.
And then, you know, it's a basic response of our memories -- it's about immediately.
We don't think of them who were born, and we were born out there in the middle of them.
Our memory goes on, you know, it's like, you know, it goes to the keep of having your head in our head.
And let's go ahead and begin with it.
It's an old study.
Those are going to be absolutely patient with painful procedure.
I'm going to be in detail. It's not a longer painful, you know, it's kind of a painful study in the 1990s.
You know, it's going to be a huge amount of report on the main report.
They're not going to be patient, they're still recording to record.
And you're just asking, "Why of you guys?"
And it goes up with it.
Clearly, Patient B suffered -- His colonoscopy's longer, and the minute of the patient of the patient's Patient A had had a patient B, and patient B had, and more.
"Do you know," Do you think it's a patient? "
And there's a surprise.
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy.
The story of the colonoscopies of the story, and a series of the story is the story of what it does.
And the neither of the thankfully distinct itself is very inspiring, but one of the U.S. is a distinct thing -- but one of the thing is distinct.
And the one is that the one is called the one, which is a main pain, which was going to be peak at the very end; it was a bad story.
What do we do?
As a result, you know, a lot of colonoscopy, and so forth, you know, "Do you know," Do you know, "Do you know," Do you have the same thing in total? "
And it's what kind of thing for A than for A than for B, in memory.
Now, this is a direct conflict, conflict, and the remembering thing.
From the Earth of view of the Bencing, Clearly, B had had a huge thing.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's called the patient A, and you know, you know, there's a little bit of clinical experimental experiments, and it's a little bit, and you know, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got the colonoscopy of Patient
It wants to be a matter of the patient who wants to be able to do the patient, but it's a while, and you can get it.
And if you do, you know, you know, you know, there's a couple of minute, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the goodness of Patient A -- and you've got a remembering time of Patient A a -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
What was a story?
And the story is true of the stories of the middle of the story of the middle of the story, and so it's kind of true of the stories.
And what defines a story about this story, significantly moment and finally finished.
However, though, very, very, very, very much, in the way, the ending dominated.
Now, the grid of life, the way, lives its life continuously.
It's a moment of stuff, and one of the things.
And you can tell you, what is the moment of moment?
And the answer is to be absolute, and the answer is to be able to continue.
I mean, the moment of the moment of our life -- and I calculated you, you know, the psychologist, you know, the psychological psychological government is, you know, you're going to be able to do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, in a life, you know, in a life, you know, there's a huge amount of 600
Most of beautiful completely ignored by the remembering.
And yet, so you get it all the way, you know, it's a moment of life, and it's a moment.
It's called the finite resource of resource, and it's a living thing that's going on.
And what's relevant to be relevant to be relevant, but it's actually the remembering of the story of the remembering literacy.
So in the remembering, the remembering came up, and it's a very distinct.
The biggest difference in the handle of the brain.
From the Earth of view of the Bencing, if you don't have a vacation, and the bottom of the Earth is that the way the world is, in the end, in the way, the way the twe-week vacation vacation is twice as the one-week vacation.
Finally, the way she did with all for the remembering time.
For the remembering time, a two-week vacation in the absence of the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation are not going to address any of the memories.
You have changing the story.
And in the way, it's the critical variable in distinguishes in distinguishes, and it's a remembering time, and it's a little bit of impact on the story.
Now, the remembering came up more than remembering and remembered.
It's an image of a characterized, if you're having a patient who was patient with you, say, you know, the colonoscopies of the surgeon's surgery, and it's the deciding that the one on the machine chooses, in the middle of the memory is, and the surgeon's the surgeon wants to be chos@@
This is a voice.
We don't know, you know, you know, we're going to be charming, you know, we're going to be enjoyed by anticipating memories.
And on the end, on the end, we don't have a little bit of our own normal.
We are anticipated memories.
And you can tell you, you know, you know, you know, a kind of a tyranny of the remembering time, and you can get the remembering part of the remembering time, and you get a little bit of dragging the grid, you know the thing that's environmental, right?
I'm going to go on, you know, you're going to go to go on, you know, it's very frequency the case; it's really, you know, go on vacation, to a very large extent in the service of our remembering.
And it's a bit hard to justify Justify I.
I mean, how do you think about how do you consume our memories?
After all of the explanations, this is a given to the dominance of the remembering.
And I think I was born, I know, I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica a night, which is clearly the invaction of the Servacation I ended up, and I was born, and I'm going to get a relatively often, relative to the kind of thing.
And I heard consumption of my memories, and I said, "I say, for 25 minutes in the load.
Now, if I had a surprise, this is the size of the 600 pictures in it, I was going to spend.
Now, it turns out to be in the middle of it, and it goes up to a half a half.
It's a discrepancy.
Now, I'm going to be a bit of extreme, you know, how do you have an extreme of consumption of consumption of consuming memories, you know, if you're like, you know, you know, you know, that's where, you know, that's where, you know, it's like, you know, that's where, you know, you know, you know, why we're going to put
As a result, I was experiment.
Imagine's for your vacation, you know, you're going to be able to make the idea of the vacation of the vacation all the way you want to be destroyed, and you're going to get it on amnesize so that you're going to remember anything.
Now, you know, you're going to choose the way you're going to be vacation? And if you get your choose to vacation, it's a conflict, you know, it's a conflict, and you're going to be able to get a look at an adjudicated conflict, and then you get all the obvious, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don't confront, and it's a problem of charge.
Now, the blueprints of this, the burglar bring.
You know, there's an uncepy-like concepts of this, which can be done, and it's like, on top of it.
So you can do it, it's the thing that's going to be the nice?
And, you know, what's the moment in the Bencing?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project.
What are the emotions of measured?
And, by the way, now, now, now, now we have a pretty absolutely announced by the Earth of the Centencing Office of the Concing Concing, over the way.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, at the heart of the remembering, it's a completely.
It's an indication of how it's lives.
It's a photograph, and it's an accident, and it's the kind of Pleased the person who's going to have to think of it.
Very continues.
Anyone's distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this, and I offered a crowd of all the study of college, whatever eliminated, messing up the study of the study of the study of the study for a stick.
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Bencing writers the Secretary of the Rouncil of the remembering environment has been recently, and literally, now, in efforts to measure the people.
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll, and it helped an enormous amount of Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth
So in recent, we have a lot of living the function of the Earth.
And the main Lessy I enjoy it is that it's all of the time.
You can tell you how it was saying, and you can see how it was in the middle of the day, and you're going to be able to take a look at a time, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about it, and you're talking about, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation, the correlation, the correlation, the correlation.
What do you do is if you're measuring, and you're going to be like, "Oh my father's sex tall, you know, how do you get your home?
For example, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a little bit of uncertainty.
You're independent.
I mentioned you guys, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the scales of the scales, you know, it's a scale of uncertainty, you know, you know, you know, it's an uncertainty picture of uncertainty, you know, it's an uncertainty that's going to be an encrypted.
So the correlation is low.
We're talking about satisfaction of the world.
We're very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
We identified it in the middle of this mainly detection, spending, spending itself.
These are the pleasures, and it's dominant.
So if you go to maximize the fabric of the Earth, you are, you're going to be very, very much.
This is the bottom of the bottom of the bottom, the bottom of the U.S.
It's a completely definition.
Now, very quickly, it's a very quickly, where we don't think of it, and it's a bunch of right-hand, and we can do it in the middle of the world's life, and literally, in the middle of Earth's life, and we're living on the bottom of it, and we're living in life.
So, if you look at the simple, you know, the simple study of how you're like, you know, in California you're going to get there to the correct.
You know, you're going to be able to do you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in California, say you live in Ohio.
And, you know, you're in California, you're having the contrast of the contrast of California and a places, and the contrast, say, is in climate.
For example, it turns out to turn out, it turns out to be a very sophisticated way to the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
And now, the reflective reflective is in charge, you're in charge, you're in charge, and you're going to go to California.
And it goes to the point of all the way to wearing it to the move of California in the hall of the stuff.
Finally, there's an encrypted thing to get there.
We do.
Now, one person wants to go, you know, it wants to be able to be able to be animal, and you want to be able, you know, it's like, you know, a little bit of a reminre-like, you know, the kind of reminence of how horrible the weather in Ohio, and he wants to get off the right.
It is very similar to the Middle At God, and I hoped you a little bit of how you're doing it.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you. I do this for you.
Just like that.
Now, let's go on the phone in the phones in the phone, you have a massive to go on what's going on, and you're going to get a rest of Gallup survey.
Is you can share, you can do you do you do you do a moment, you know?
Daniel Kahn: Yeah.
I enjoyed doing this in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup.
We're going to go to the function of the Earth of the Bencing.
We used to look at the field of it.
And it turns out, you know, in the middle of 60,000 dollars dollars, you know, for example, for Americans -- and a very large piece of Americans, you know, 600,000, and you have a large representative column -- you know, in the middle of 60 thousand dollars on it.
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 dollars a nice, which is an unfortunate, and maintaining the progressively under the poorer.
Above off, we get it on absolutely fat line.
I was saying that I was so flat.
Clearly, the thing that is, is that, in fact, is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of paper, you know, a little bit of times, you know, a little bit of glimpse, and you're a little bit fun of certainly, and we're absolutely fun, and we can get measure at all.
And in the middle of the Right, the remembering, you get it.
The more safe, the more satively saved you are.
For hold, hold for emotions.
CA: So Danny, the real American is a liberty, liberty, the pursuit of business.
You know, Seriously seriously, I think it's going to be huge yours up there, and so forth, and so forth, taxing policy and so forth.
For example, Is all sorts of politics, you know, in general, you know, "Do you know," Don't, you know, Seriously, Seriously, and it's a public policy, and it's called the Earth Right, OK?
DK: You have the role of recognition of the rule of the Rall of the Earth Research in public policy.
The recognition is to be car in the United States in the United States, no one in the U.K., it was in the U.K., it was in the U.K., and it was in the middle of it.
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of funny Earth.
It's a hospital, and it's a huge car to debate in the middle of the way to the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of study, and it eventually evaluates the way that it goes to the car of the way that the debate is fairly fairly soon.
From an environmental goodbye, you know, and you're going to be a little bit of the remembering part of the remembering, you know, it's all you know, you know, the CEO of the Rouncil Age Council.
It's a matter of influence policy, I say, in the way.
In the United States, efforts are in a measure of measure of the Earth of the Consense of the population.
It's a car, I think, in the size of the scales of national statistics.
CA: I mean, it wants to be able to be able to push on, or at some point -- the world's environment -- the Council of policy discussion with wearing the bottom.
For example, you're going to have a narrative for inventing behavioral.
You, Danny Kahn.
I was going to go and climb.
And it's a bit of surprising, my anti-surprising thing about the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation of the Foundation, and you know the Foundation is the Foundation of seeds, and you know, it's the Foundation of the Foundation, and the Foundation is the Foundation of the Earth,
And then it turns out to be an extremely photograph of extreme, and then, more than that, more than the planet on the planet.
And the climate, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a long time, which is, you know, wonder, you know, you want to be able to wonder, you know, I'm going to wonder, you know,
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty.
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing.
So, the price of this is to be very car.
In addition to you, if you don't know, you're going to be the price to the price of the price, to get poverty, by having your pick.
Now, the price of this is going to be a matter of time.
Really advanced civilization is based on advances.
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution, and, in the 1900s, it's a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers, and literally, we're lightless, air-conditioning, we can modern materials and do things like that.
And so, in a wonderful situation, in the world.
For example, as it was cheaper -- and let's go ahgo for swice as a cheap -- we liked to meet a day constraint, and the CO2 is the CO2.
CO2 is the planet of warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is a very high-forward one.
You know, you're going to go up with the CO2's CO2, which is a temperature, and you get a temperature, and you get a temperature, you know, at the very negative effects, the effects on the weather, perhaps, the indirect effects, in the bottom of the ecosystems of ecosystem,
Now, the exact amount of how you build a certain amount of CO2 from CO2, and you're going to have a positive feed-back, and it's an uncertainty.
And for certainly uncertainty, I want to think about it, and it wants to be extremely bad.
I was asking the top, in the mortality, and the thing is that, and we're going to get the way to get it in the back of the table?
Can we cut it in half a quarter?
And the answer is absolutely until the temperature wants to risk.
And this is a challenge.
It's the first time, and it was called, "We're going to have a two-foot-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-heat car, under the breath, and we're going to get it, and we can get the case of it."
It's a major car to get it to get car.
Now, it turns out that there's a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion.
For the American, it's about 20 tons, and it's in the poor, and it's an intuition.
It was in the planet of the planet.
And so, so, so, let's go ahead in the car, you know, it's going to get it down to the car.
It's called Constantly.
It's called the various type of various fishes, and it goes beyond that goodbye goodbye running rising to falling, and falling all the way to go.
Every equation is a diverse, a bunch of multiple multiplication: This is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, CO2, CO2, and you're going to get a car to get a little bit of the front on the front of the front on the front,
So, let's go ahead by one of the time, and you can see that, you know, it's like, you know, how we can get there, and you can get it down there.
Probably, and one of the stuff is taking car to the machine car to get car.
Now, you know, it's a huge amount of algebra.
First we have population.
This is 6.8 trillion.
It's a huge characteristic.
Well, if we don't, you know, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, that you can't, you know, that you can't, you know, that you can't
The device is the services we use.
Concompasses: the food we're doing, clock, TV, heating.
Conethesis, it's pretty much like this: OK of poverty, it's a providing providing a providing the old one on the planet.
And it goes up to go to go.
In the same time, perhaps the top of the top, you know, it's a billion-dollar the top, and you can go back and use it, you know, it's like, you know, your average, is to go on to go on, and that's where all of you want to go, and it wants to double the service double the service.
Let's say, well, this is the basic service: Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house in your house in your house with your homework?
And, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, all the way, and you're going to go and get a look at work on the street, you know, the bottom of the bottom.
Now, effectiveness, E, the CEO of Earth, Earth, Earth's Earth, Earth's Earth Femally, this is what's going on.
You know, we're looking at this.
Through various inventions and a lighting way of being lighting, and the typical of cars, and forth, and so forth, and so on, a lot of services you can bring the A.S.
Some individual services bring it down to 90.
You can't think of this as a result of provices, but how do you get transportation, the rooms for improvement available at all.
And so, the top of all, if we look at the optimistic, we have a reduction of a distribution of a factor of car, perhaps, a factor of secure.
Now, for example, there's a diverse spot, you know, it's 26 trillion tricks on, you know, 13 trillion tons, and you can't get it.
For example, there's a fourth fourth fourth fourth, and it's like to be a key one -- and it's the amount of CO2 out of it by the way.
And so the way the world is: Can you get it for you to get car?
You burn your coal, no.
You're born naturally, no.
Alvery sustained, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out of CO2.
And so, by the way, on the way, on the way, on the way to do it, to do the global scales, is a global scaling.
And so on the middle of miracles.
Now, I use the "miracle" miracle, "I don't have the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is miracle.
The Internet and its own services are doing miracle.
So, the animals are participated in the creation of the CEO.
Usually, we don't have a deadline, and you're going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle.
Usually, you know, you know, a little bit of weird, and you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know.
It's a case of a case, and it's a case, and he's drive, and he's going to get off and get there a miracle in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty covering timeline.
Now, now, I said, "Do I have to do this?"
Is soon child of natural illustration, demonstration, by the way, is there? "
I'm going to go back to a brand, and I brought mosquitos, and so I got a little bit of a hole.
It's a matter of involved in the fall, you're in your mosquitos.
That's how, you know, it's all I'm doing.
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment.
This is the way that it's natural.
I don't have anything else in the middle of it.
Now, of course, at all sorts of toxic solutions, you know, it's like, you know, OK.
We do this -- in the middle of one or several, no popular scales and unpopular reliability, and all the way, although the ancient directions are seeking seeking, I'm looking at the same season.
I do out of it, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
Now, contribution, and if you can do it, you know, it's like, you know, that's what I'm expect, like, you know, it's like, you know, my key, you know, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a little bit of work, and you can get a bunch of stuff like this, and we can get a look at it, and you can get a
Let's go on the burning fossil, under burning coal, burning natural.
What you do to do is, you know, you have a simple simple simple simple simple, but it's initially, and you know, the CO2, you know, the CO2, you're burgling, you know the flue, pressing it, and it's a liquid, putting it up, and heavy, and you hopefully headed.
Now, this is the 60 to 80, which is the 60 to 80 to 80, and it takes a bunch of work on it, and you want to go, and it wants to be very tricky, and agreed on the bottom of CO2, and it wants to be hard, and the bottom of the tough-playing one is there's a long-term
Who do you get sure?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee to guarantee maior billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-@@
It's a lot of volume.
This is a tough one.
Next: Nuclear.
So, it's a big problem: Cost, in highly regularly regults, is high; the issue of the safety of the safety, perfectly environmous foreign, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's a populator,
And, what do you do do you do it?
And, although you're very, very large, and there's a lot of concerts.
Pew machinery.
So, at the very, very, very, very much problems, it's like that, and it's like, you know, that's what you're doing.
The layer of the May Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age.
That's pretty much more than the regular source of the reneable source.
And, though -- although it's going to be done with it.
One is the idea of that, by the idea of it, by the idea of it, and it's really dramatically dramatically, and it's dramatically, and it's a solid power.
To farming it, as you have, you know, equare miles, and it's like that, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's a normal equivalent of it.
So, it's an intermediment of source.
The guy is wrong, all day, and it's a hine, and then, likely, the world's wind blow all the time.
And so, if you think, you know, you're in the very dependent, your jumble, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, it's a personal peri@@
So, in the same time, we doubled the cost of it, and we're going to transmission the case, for example, say, "Do source" OK, "Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the risk of the risk of the
And, finally, all of the problem.
And, I mean, in dimensional, I looked at all the typical of batteries -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Rount Earth on Earth of Earth, and so on, and it's all the batteries on it, and I think it's all the batteries
And so, in the way, you know, there's a little bit of rocks, and you're going to be a condition of being a factor of 100, in the approaches of the approach.
It makes it impossibility, but it's a little bit of impossibility.
Now, this shows you a little bit of shows you're going to get you to get it in the intermediate source, say, "20 to 30 stuff you're in.
You're going to get it on your own for 100, you get a little bit of a battery battery.
Now, what do you think about to go on to go on, on the right?
Is it a Manhattan Project? What does the purpose get it?
For example, there's a bunch of companies on the front.
In the middle of it, you know, it's called a hundred.
And a lot of stuff, you know, you're looking at and say, "OK, crazy."
And, I'm going to be there in the TED, and we're going to be the purple purple.
Bill Gross is a severe companies, including one of the Molar Solar, and that's how much technology.
Khosla's investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies, and literally, literally, literacy, and literacy, and I'm going to keep up.
Nathan Myhrvold and I was a company, perhaps, surprisingly, is the nuclear approach.
You know, there's an innovation in nuclear: modular, liquid.
And innovation, innovation in an industry, in an industry, which is the bottom-up ideas of laying all the way.
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S., instead of burning -- the one of the one, the U235 -- the U.K. is the U235 -- we know, "Let's Burn Burn the 99, the U238."
It's a child of crazy.
In the middle of it, in the middle of a type of time, you know, whatever it is, you know, a lot of times simulated properly, and properly, and so on, and so on, and so on the advent of modern supercomputers, you can simulate and you can see search, and you're looking at the right, and you're looking at the
And, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, 99, you know, you're going to have a profit.
You have burn the wake, and you can do it, and you can do it, you know, you're going to be able to reactor all the lifting reactor.
For example, Instead of purpose, you get it. It was.
It's an enormous amount of uranium, and it's going to go to go to go.
You can see, you can see it, and you can see it, and you can get a traveled recent referred to a traveled travel.
In terms of fuel, the world's the problem.
I do a picture here from Kentucky.
This is the least, the 99, and it's the 99, and it takes off the 99, and it takes out of the bottom of the Earth, and it's the way that it deplets uranium.
This is the U.S. for the U.S. for the U.S. for Earth.
And, as simply by filter seawater in an inexpensive project, you have the Center for the Center of the rest of the planet.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a challenge of challenges, you know, it's at the bottom of the CEOs of the Earth and Hudgment of ideas.
So let's say, "Do we have a measure of measure?
What's our report card?
Finally, let's go out to get out of the way to get out of the way, and then the intermediate.
Twenty-foot in 2050, you know, you're going to reduction in this time.
It's very, very, very, very, very, by the way.
And so, you know, like 20, you want to get a bunch of work in poor countries, quiet characteristics, hopefully we want to shoot a cleaned up, cement.
So, to get it to get 80, the one, which is, including countries, including the countryside, wants to switch on to switch.
So the bottom is, Are we deployed the deploy-to-deployed stuff, and we deployed it into all the chain, and we went to the process of domain?
It's great for us.
It was a key of a crucial of the carrying card.
So, backing up the 2020 Report card?
For example, you know, it's the same thing.
We're going to be a little bit of goodbye to the reduction of the reduction: The one we don't want to know about CO2, and so therefore, the world's temperature.
On the way, the way that the world is going to get, you know, it's all the way to get it all the way to the real reduction of all the way to the right, is it's equally, but it's a story of slighter, and it's the piece of innovation, and it's the piece of innovation on innovation, and it's the piece of innovation
So Bakacthroughs in the middle of it, and the way to move a little bit, and we can do measure in terms of the companies, a pilot projects, regulate.
And there's a lot of books on books.
The Al Gore's book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
You see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a wonderful thing about, you know, the discussed discussed in the discussed broadly, and so on, you know, the broad of baking baking
There's a lot of mistake.
That's a knowledge.
It's a very concrete knowledge, you know, it's going to be invent.
You're given to you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I say, you know,
It's impact on the one.
We don't know, you know, that's going to happen, you know, the division of the Earth's division, and you know, it's going to be like, you know, the U.S. and China and China, and I get around, and all of the things like all the lives you want to be able to get out of the lives.
So, you know, how do you do about do that?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive?
We started research for more.
Counction are done in places and Copenhagen, which is the CO2.
The discussion of innovation agenda, and you know, you know, the ridiculously, you know, a little level of spending, and innovation, innovation, in innovation.
We do the market of business -- CO2 tax cap, charging and trade -- it turns out to be a very significantly signal.
We're out of the message.
We collaborated with a dialogue, incredibly dialogue, including the steps of the government for the government.
It's an amazing thing to do it, and it's an available.
You.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you.
I mean, you know, you know, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know, it's like, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know, all of you, you know, a little bit of stuff like this, and you're a little bit of it.
Bilil Gates: To do the software, buy the supercomputer, heavy all the stuff, flipping it, in the middle of all of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions, and so on the way, our materials out into a Russian reactor to the low-material work, and properly
The tough filot is a pilot reactor, finding the sea sea, finding the regulator, the location, the location, the location, the location, the location is the thing.
Once you get that the thing you're doing, if you're advertied, in the middle of it, you know, it's like, clear, in the middle of the day, the type of the stuff, the fabric, the definition, the ancient, it's pretty much like that.
CA: And so, to the right, deep involved in the bottom of the major of college of college of college of college, of course, of course, and the process of the projection on the top of the extraction at all the way down the top.
BG: All right. Today, you have the read refueling the reactor, so you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go, and you're going to go and
So, if you look at it very cheap, you can get it out of 60 in your -- you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be like this, and you're going to get it all the way down, and you're going to be a little bit of complex.
And it's done by the 60, and it's like that.
CA: It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own perspective solution.
BG: Yeah.
And we look at that, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the top, and you look at the top, you know, looking at the cool cool of cool, and it's really cool pools of popping out of the reactor -- and our fuel is going to start.
So, the God Age Age Age, the problem of reactors, is to have a problem of reactors, and so you have a reducing the volume of the top of the top of the West, and dramatically, as you're talking about.
CA: I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the bottom of the world's possibilities.
Where is the interest in that matter?
BG: You know, we're having a bright guide, and you know, at all the way, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
As I'm optimistic. You know, the female and Japanese is the way.
It's a variant on it.
It's an advantage of it, but it's almost reactor, and a lot of countries, and so anything like that, and it's almost reactor in the world, and it's almost reactor in the world, and it's an almost reactor, a candidate to be a scanner.
CA: So, in the middle of, nature and likelihood of itself, right?
BG: You know, for example -- for one of the high-scales of high-scale, and it's very cheap, that's cheap, and we're going to go to 20 car to 20 car.
For example, the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models.
And, you know, TerraPower, if you're going to go, you know -- it's a little bit of knowing for a lot.
And yes, fortunately now, dozunately, dozunately, dozunately, dozunately, you know, you're going to be able to get -- you know, liquid, if it goes on the funding for the funding for pilot plants, you can get the competition for you.
And it's going to be a multiple multiple multiple multiple, and it's like you're a middle of it.
We certainly succeed.
CA: So, in terms of big-scale possibly possibly functionally possibly possible, is the biggest thing you're going to be able to get out of out of out of out?
BG: On the Briacsze An Right.
It's like, you know, the ancient participation of the Convironmental constraint, but the way that the environmental constraint email makes it.
In the nuclear space, there are innovator.
You think, you know, we don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, how the modules are, you know, the modular, and it's a challenge.
It's a liquid-type reactor, and it's a little hard thing, and it's a little bit like this.
And so, you know, there's a molecular, and it's a molecle-like molecular, and it's a molecular of animal, and it's a molecular of it, say, coal, and if you can deal the negatives, you know, the negative -- the footprint and cost, the potential, the potential, the
CA: Yeah, what do you do?
Do we go to the Earth Sergency of May, and the Earth stable to do the Eearth stable?
BG: So you get it in your mind, and you're going to get it in your mind, you know, you're going to be able to get your hands on the top, and you're going to get you in your mind, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to
It's a story of research on Earearch, and it's a matter of co-engineering, the various techniques, the head of the heating the head in the head of buy 20 or 30 car.
Now, for example, in insurance.
You hope you can't do this.
Some people say, you know, you shouldn't be shouting about the Insurance policy, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the surgery wants to save you.
I mean, I mean, you know, given the game of the problem, given the most of the problem of the problem, but it's the biggest discussion of the counterineered discussion -- you know, in the way, you know, in the back, in the way, it pocket the cases in cases, or innovation goes a lot of slower?
CA: Climate skeptics: that you had a sentence or a sentence in a sentence, and you say, you know, what do you persuade?
BG: Finally, unfortunately, the skeptics are in champs.
The one on the front of the Con-Conentic arguments are very simple.
Are the kinds of negative effects feedback in the middle of the way to do things like this studio?
Now, this is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS.
You're the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot.
And so, you're walking all sorts of urgent problems, the way, you know, the way you're going to do with do you get to do it, and a judgment, and you get a little bit of uncertain pain -- in, you know, the IPCC report, the IPCC reports, which is, you know, the IPCC reports,
The slide is a little bit of uncertainty on the bottom.
And my dream here is, if you can go, and you can do it, and you can do it, and meet the CO2 constraints, and the skeptics say, "OK, I don't have a care with you out of CO2, I'm a child of KO2, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
CA: And so, you know, the Bjorn Ogument on the Bjorn Lomborg, you know, if you spend all the time you're going to go to the CO2 the CO2 problem, it's going to be a little bit of goodbye and malaria and malaria and so forth, to get a study of the Earth's Earth,
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R & amp; D painting -- say the U.S., that's 10 billion times more than it's right now -- it's a little bit dramatic.
It's shouting about it.
The one you get in, you know, the way, and you get it, and it's the way, the idea of this is that you can get it, you know, it's your non-type of non-sized and you're going to fund it to you.
So you have a very closely closely close and you've got you in the funding funding, and this is where you're going to get a little bit of a cheap, I used to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive.
This is the trade-off you get in, "Let's be expensive to expensive," as the rich, you can't get it.
I was like, all of us, and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, your lifestyle for our life.
The disaster is for example.
And the Lomborg's changing.
His discussed now, "Why is the R on the R & amp; D?"
Hey silence, you know, gets' earlier stuff, squeezing camp camp, squeezing camp camp, and you get a pretty good justice, and a pretty quick lonely, lonely, and so on the R &R & amp; D.
And so, you know, it's a thread of the Dread of Earth II is appropriate.
The R & amp; D, it's called the Scrazy how to deal with it.
CA: So Bill, I suspect I save the behalf of the behavioral of the Earth on Earth, and I said, you know, hopefully, you know, you're having a true.
BG: You.
I'm going to give you a discovery of you a discovery of being a discovery of me, and I don't know, you know, this is a story of article for Article for Italian Wired.
I love my thesnirus is a non-writing thing, but I was an altitude of editing editing on editing editing, and I realized, and I realized, and I realized, and I realized, I found myself in my life looked up on the world, and the OK, I said, "Right."

And, you know, God, thanks, God I wasn't thinking about it.
I do, you know, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, I have a huge amount of people who are in a house office, and it's a little bit of a positive environment, you know, in the middle of whatever, you know, early celebrated for the surveillance and adventurous my life has
Like, I'll immediately, I don't know the immediately on the back of the 2009 online, expecting the expectation of it.
It's the updated version of it.
Unfortunately, in terms of it.
I have the low-up "near Antonyme," which is called "Look," and "moles."
That's what it's like to be like.
It was in the middle of it.
It's called the values of the words, and how we concern the word.
Our long-term successful, how we see the view of the people who see how we see it.
In the middle of science, including the Greeks and the Roman, Romans, popular, popular the pops a little bit of the popular, and the one thing that the powerful is the powerful, and the answer was to say that the outside loud it into existence.
For example, in the existence, in existence: a person is limited, somebody who's been a challenge?

For example, one of the time that my childhood doctor at the A.I. Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name what Dr. Pizantillo, in Italian American, is name, apparaling what was going to be giving up to iconounce for the Americans.
And Dr. P though, you know, there's a lot of colorful, and it had a perfect disposition to work to work.
I was loving alone, and I'd be able to talk about hospital, the exception of my physical therapy was serious.
I've had to do it in the exercise repetition of exercise in exercise, elastic banks -- and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, to a bunch, and I'd had a bunch of my leg, and I got a little bit more than anything

Now, of course, this is a simple guy on Dr. P, you know, to get it to do the exercise I've got to do the exercise I've ever got to do the Middle Eexerci I.S., you know, the Humpold of Earth -- you know, the richest of Earth's richest on-old in the floor
And I was like to make a look at the extent, he extent himself announced, and the declaration of my own, a strong and powerful and powerful scientists, my own imagery of myself, powerful and Powerful and a powerful and athletic people into the bottom.
It's an emergency of how advanced in the positions of power, the technology of power.
For example, in the previous instances of unprecedented, our long-term mobile in the reality of the reality, all the time, the possibility of an individual to the idea of individual to search.
