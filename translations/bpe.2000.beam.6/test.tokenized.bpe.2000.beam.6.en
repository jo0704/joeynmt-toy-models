Several officer , at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design of the marshmallow .
And the very pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple : teams of the Middle At the test standing the talling of the test , you know , like the talling of 20 sticks , and one yard of tape , and one yard of dying , and one yard of a marshmallow .
The marshmallow hand is to be .
And , in fact , it &apos;s a very simple thing , and it &apos;s hard to pretty much depending on the collaborator in the pretty quickly .
And so I think about what was going on , and I incorporated it into a design shop .
And so what a huge is looking for .
And then , you know , I &apos;m spending 70 designs in 70 design , and designed and designed and architects , the CTOs of the Fortune &apos;s 50 , and there &apos;s an extract exercise that reveals the exercise of the very deep of the collaboration of collaboration , and I &apos;m going to share .
So , normally , it &apos;s taken by orienting themselves in the world .
On the way , characteristics out of it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , jucky .
There &apos;s a way to start planning , organizing organizing , sketch on the spaghetti .
This is the majority of the majority of chembling the sticks into ever-grand .
And then finally , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , like , you know , outside the marshmallow , and it turns out to be like , and it turns out to be like , and it was standing , and it was a day , and it was a chunch of work .
On the heart of the day , it &apos;s called the &quot; tye &quot; and &quot; Tuh-oh &quot; -- &quot; The Byo Oh , &quot; &quot; The Bourt of the marshmallow circle of the marshmallow &quot; collapse . &quot;
So , as you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a lot of stuff like that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment , and among the world are very recent graduate of business graduates .
Something , you know , cheat , gets distracted by it .
And of course , of course , technically teams of people who are going on , and it &apos;s like , &quot; tac-da &quot; worth , and among the absolutely recent graduate .
And it was amazing .
At Peter tells us , perhaps , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s the most processing , you know , it &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be like , you know , the whole thing &apos;s really , you know , it &apos;s all the way .
So the bottom line : is that ? Why ? What is it ?
And Peter liffs to say , you know , none of the Men of the PEOs , you know , CEO of Spaghetti , Inc . Right ?
It &apos;s not a little bit of jucky power .
Between the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be a well .
And the reason is a bunch of business , trained to the sound right now , right ?
And the execute on it .
And , by the time , is that the marshmallow of the marshmallow on the top , call out of itself out of itself ?
It was a crisis .
Right ? Right .
What major do differentiate is called the marshmallow , and a sharing prototype , successive prototype , checing the marshmallow , white multiple car is a prototyping prototype along the way .
Designers recognize the collaboration of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project .
And then , rather version , they get strong feedback , and that &apos;s what they do .
So the thing in prototyping with a prototype is essential , and let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on .
So the average for them is , you know , the average is , you know , in the average , in the average , and business schools , a half of them , lawyer , a purpose , you know , a down-advanced station , and more customized , thickled , thoughts ,
Who does this matter ?
Architect and engineer , thanky .
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world world .
And so on , you know , it &apos;s going to be the potential and self-cleanly geetetrical powered geetrical patterns in the world .
So CEOs , a piece of that CEOs , a little bit of an average , and it &apos;s coming up with that .
You put you on executive adminances on the team , given significantly .
It &apos;s called you , it &apos;s called you , you &apos;re going to go , you go , you go , you go , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; Win the way . &quot;
You can be conscious . You can get it .
It &apos;s a little bit of skills of divertation .
And there &apos;s a project that project the project .
And whatever , you know , team totally close attention to work to work with significantly improve the team .
Specializing skills and facilitation is that the combination of the combination of stress is to stress up to strong .
For example , you &apos;re having typically performance typically performance , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to have sex of this kind of thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s in the way that you see .
And I tried .
I do , let &apos;s go once .
So I offered a 10,000 dinner price of software to the winning .
So , how do you know , how do you get to be done with that , to design , design ?
What about the world ?
Finally , she said , &quot; No two team had a standing in a standing .
Now , anyone had a piece of sharing , say , you know , on the bottom of this , you say , &quot; Don &apos;t be the price . &quot;
Like , isn &apos;t it ? However stacking , staces , staces , stacks impact .
We arrived at the exercise on the exercise .
What do you do ?
As now , the value of prototyping .
So this is the bottom of the very , very much , the very way to do the same thing about the stuff .
At the tallest , the tallest in the least , the test of the brain .
This is the nature of the nature of the nature of incentives and search .
So , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of a marshmallow , you know , you &apos;re having a marshmallow ?
And the reason is , I &apos;m making a process of processing tools and processing processing the cars of taking video and it &apos;s a visual effects .
And the marshmallow is challenged to work on identify the day .
Frankly , frankly , it project has marshmallow , right ?
The challenge provides provides a shared , and a slide of a long time , a sustainable , a little bit of a pole on the right .
And so , you know , the value of the City of the City of the City of the exercise .
And it &apos;s like you &apos;re going to be able to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It &apos;s a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of called the marshmallows .
Final by-step-by-step steps .
You know , it &apos;s a little bit of crazy fuzy , and it &apos;s the mobile phonomenon of the system .
You know , there &apos;s an autonomous type of people who are there .
And the fundamental lesson , I think , is a design , design is a contact .
It demanded the way we bring all of our head to the top , and it goes up the very all of our own , our fellow , our fellow and our case to the challenge .
And , you know , there &apos;s a prototype of the prototype of that , and it &apos;s all the way to turn it into a type of type of type of type , and it &apos;s like , &quot; uh-oh , &quot; right now .
And that &apos;s a little bit differently .
All right .
Let &apos;s get a little predent right now .
A more machine , a cool , TEDish machine , and it machine , it machine .
And then you get it in the way to get it into it .
And you can go , you can go on , you can go forward , you can &apos;t have you yourself .
And I wonder , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was boreful , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and
I don &apos;t know , I think , to go to go to go back and Twitter , or Twitter , &quot; American Idol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I was convinced with nonviolent , of pull to nostalgia , to knowing you .
And I do .
I mean , I said , &quot; I mean , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say , &quot; I say . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to go to go back , and it &apos;s called an adventurous way .
It &apos;s offering the possibilities of being planet , which is going to be done , you know , it &apos;s going to be done , you know , Congo .
So I do in the machine in the machine , and I goodbed to go to go .
This is the greatest of the coast of the coast of the case , and it &apos;s based on a planet , and it &apos;s based on it , and it &apos;s basically choose to choose , which is , by the way , mobility , autonomous , declining rates of disease ...
It was a matter of mind .
My great-graded participation , all of the things , by the mate of 60 .
My grandparents pushed 70 .
My participants are pointed in the 80 .
This is how it was a nine at the beginning of my death .
With you , it &apos;s a bigger , and it &apos;s a bigger deal .
A kid in the born in New Delhi in New Delhi , excited to live to live in the world , in fact , the world in the world is 100 .
Think , you know , it &apos;s going to be done for that .
And does it happen ?
Smallpox . Smallpox killed a billion-billion-plan .
It reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way , and it was not a mistake .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a Dvanished .
We vanquish it . Puff .
Now , in the same time , threatened millions of us is that there is no longer , hardly .
Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
Is it going to be there ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to be fed billions of stuff , which is the Center of the Centch method .
And to my mind , the Cententific method -- stuff out out , searched if it works on , is one of the Central Office of Humble of humanity .
That &apos;s the way we look at it .
Unfortunately , in fact , all the way news the way , it &apos;s a little bit problem , and it turns out that it &apos;s a moment .
And one of it is that all our accomplished all our accomplishments , a trillion of goes to the bed hungry to get hungry into the day .
You know , it &apos;s called the rising , and it &apos;s a very rapidly sharing , and it &apos;s very rapidly , and it &apos;s a little bit of discovery .
And then , you know , that &apos;s where our imagination to the thoroughly thoroughly drash .
Potal water , Arabland , rainforests , oil , gas , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , and innovate , innovate in the way out , we have a moment .
So the thing is , Can we do ? And I can do it .
I mean it was clear to be able to do it , I want to get food , it wants to be a little bit of billions of the Earth , and it goes into the country .
I like to do that , the destroy of power , destroy .
I do it , and I don &apos;t know , you know , it &apos;s going to be in the way .
Every one of the world &apos;s heavy keeps at the top of the Earth keeps up there -- one of the Earth keeps going up with night : We &apos;re going to be progress in the Conence more than that right now .
And so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a position in a position to deploy the properly in the way we can .
We have the verge of amazing , and yet I &apos;ve gone to go to go to go to go back to go , 300 people , the Enlightenment , to the British Age Age Age Congress , who was going to be a little bit of the progress , and we went to find a little bit of time , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know ,
Peating wrap is very popular , and so you know , it &apos;s so ugly the way you can do it .
On the audience wants to go .
And , listening , contemplated with an opinion -- the Contled purpose of being progressed .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You knew entirely your own . Sorry , you know .
And hang out to characteristics .
There &apos;s a story , I wrote a story , Vaccine for The New Yorker .
And I think it &apos;s a popular opposition : the opposition to it is , it &apos;s all , the Con-effective public , and it &apos;s a math .
I do to do it , I do , the way I do , I wrote , I wrote a story , and I was a mobile .
And so , I wrote a story , I wrote a story .
Same one , more bigger .
Pew &apos;s crazy .
So I wrote a story about this story , and I was puzzling , and the Frankenfoods , which is the movement of moving molecules in a shark , rather than a haphazard way , which puzzling itself , which puzzling itself .
You know , you &apos;re doing it , I do . I wrote the story , I was mobion .
I have a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re falling , we &apos;re going to dinner . It was dead .
And thanthfully , she was born bothered , and I couldn &apos;t do some people out there , and eventually I do .
And in the middle of God , Congy mazes are going to happen to be fantatically going to be fantatically .
Same amazing thoughful , educated equipment .
It &apos;s also the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exact same .
And it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it .
As I do , you know , you &apos;re honest .
We ended up in the middle of the day , in the middle of Earth , Congress Congress , to progress .
We do it ambivalding .
We do it in ironic terms , &quot; Congress . &quot;
Okay , I think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for that , and I was going to be able to think about it .
We &apos;re going to read faith in an institutional , in authority , and in terms of this , and you know , there &apos;s an idea of it , and there &apos;s no idea that we shouldn &apos;t go .
You can say , &quot; You can say , &quot; and you want to be able to do it .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass deeply , hanging .
You can do you can do you can get your choose .
Now , it &apos;s the purpose of all the way in the world , and we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a problem , and it &apos;s a little bit of skepp .
Ask , which is , demand , demand is evidence .
Don &apos;t do anything .
So here , you get a little bit of this : you &apos;re going to get a little bit , you know , you &apos;re going to get your acceptance on account .
And the reason I can say , and the idea is that , in an epidemic of the epidemic of being , you know , there &apos;s an image of the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age , and I &apos;m going to hope the sea .
About 12 , which is a story that was published , a horrible story , a horrible story , the left of the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
Very scary .
For example , tons of stuff like this is what &apos;s true .
For example , tons of study like this , it &apos;s serious issues .
The job .
The bottom of the United States is called the United States , in England , Sweden , Ganada , and it &apos;s all the thing : no correlation , no one , none at all .
It &apos;s called it . It &apos;s a matter of matter , and it &apos;s a dumping anecdotes , we think we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen we have seen , and it &apos;s possible .
We don &apos;t have a level of documents of documents , and it &apos;s a government official , and I do , I said I was doing all the things .
You know ?
The results of His is an amazing thing .
Disastrous : The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs of the Earth &apos;s vaccine rate for measles .
It &apos;s discovery , and it &apos;s an ashamed of it .
It was horrible .
What about a child of a child ?
Now now , I do . I do it .
Do you see , you know , there &apos;s some kind of maps of maps ?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles ?
There are very much .
At the end of that , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like 160,000 in the payload .
A lot of death of measles -- 20 .
By the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be done , and we can put it out of our minds , and you know , Jenny McCarthy can be preachingly preaching me , and Eilliteracy , &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot;
And the thing you can do is , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to get out of this in the left , and there &apos;s a correlation .
It &apos;s not very much , though , that &apos;s the bottom of the bottom .
And it goes back to that .
It &apos;s a little while , Jonas Salk .
Heap of the world &apos;s source of some of the stuff .
No fear , no agony . Polio -- puff , gone .
It &apos;s a bad guy in the middle , which is how much .
His name is Paul Offit .
Hey hey , a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff .
It &apos;s called the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning .
Pretty , right ?
At the time , Paul &apos;s goes to go , and you know , it &apos;s a little bit of Paul , and it &apos;s a little bit like vaccine , and it &apos;s like , like valuable , and you know , it &apos;s going to be like this .
And then it goes on .
So , Paul &apos;s Ana terrorist .
And Paul Department Paul was in a public , he &apos;s going to go to the Council of Earth .
However , he asked him to go , and he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , he remembered him , and he remembered him , and he remembered him .
And hold , Do Paul was vaccine .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t say , say , vaccines are essential .
You see , you have a disease , you know , horrible discussion .
We human measles in the world .
And it turns out , and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty virtually of that , and it &apos;s going to be done by that , and it &apos;s going to be on the front of it .
And you know , you know , that &apos;s what the of measles are .
What does polio ? Let &apos;s go on . Why ?
A college of college graduated from mine wrote a couple of mine weeks , and it &apos;s like , I know , I have a little bit of a door .
There &apos;s no one .
She switched into the vaccine , you know , a polio , no way .
Fine .
Why ? Let &apos;s go on polio .
We &apos;re doing the polio in the world .
Today , I don &apos;t know , you know , this guy , you know , the guy in Lagos in Lagos in Lagos , and he &apos;s going to go to LAX , right now .
And then go to a bunch of couple of hours in a couple of hours , there &apos;s a car running a car , and then go to Long Beach , and then he &apos;s going to go on one of the fabulous TED dinner .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be a paralytic disease , and we &apos;re going to be paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t have anything else in the bottom of the bottom of it .
And the planet is the planet on the planet . There &apos;s a pretty predent about it .
Now , let &apos;s move forward in a way , and we do it .
You know , Everyone &apos;s vitamins in the morning ?
Echinacea , a type of antioxidant to get you .
I have to do it in American .
Now , the stuff of the stuff , and it &apos;s called the stuff of alternative medicine , and as a result of it , as a result of them , how many times we look at the top of it .
This is all the material .
By the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be an altitude thing .
It &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re a little billion dollars in pay 28 billion dollars in it ?
I &apos;m doing you .
Right . Dark .
Why do we do ? Why do we do ?
For example , I was there , I was having a big charma .
We have characteristics . We don &apos;t know .
And we shouldn &apos;t go and look at the care of the stuff .
It &apos;s called magic of millions .
It was in the cold of the astonishingly cold , and it soul-by-down to the movie , and it sounds like this .
So that &apos;s where it &apos;s like , and so forth do ?
We run into the arm of Big Placebo .
It &apos;s a fantastic . I do Big Placebo .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you know , it &apos;s a serious thing , and it &apos;s a crap , and we &apos;re spinning billions of dollars on it .
And I heard all sorts of things like this .
No of it -- gindgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; I don &apos;t have to get there , and so on , you know , it &apos;s a billion-dollar billions of dollars on the dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
And you &apos;re talking ? At you ? At you , I say , you know , I &apos;m going to ask you , and I say , &quot; What do you do ? Let &apos;s do things like this .
It doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
You know ? You &apos;re wrong .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if it was the size of the outside of HHS , &quot; Hmm , I found myself in the E.S. on the evidence of my experts on my experts on my experts , &quot; or simply , you know , scanctics quack to your patient &apos;s coffee .
You go back to this road and magic regularly regularly and stunny , you know , you &apos;re going to go to you , you know , you know , you know , you know .
From up up to Thabo Mberki South Africa .
Hey killed 400,000 of His in Insisting , Garlic and lemon and limon the antiretroviral press the antiretroviral prospect of AIDS .
Hundreds of deaths of GDP , in a hand , is a plagued white than any of the world &apos;s disease .
Please , don &apos;t have any consequences of consequences .
It &apos;s pretty much .
Now , the model of mindly epidemic , in the middle of right now , is the absurd of the proponent of genetically engineered food , and the organic elite .
It &apos;s the idiotic debate . It &apos;s a stick .
It &apos;s a debate , and it &apos;s called metaphor .
It &apos;s an ideology , it &apos;s going to be done .
Every single crash on Earth , in the middle of rice , the story of Parsley , the Brusss sprout a lot of you .
You think , you know , you &apos;re going to be the garden of Eden .
I wasn &apos;t , you know , it &apos;s going to be done , you know , Christmas . We &apos;re going to do it all the time .
We &apos;re on the lower 11,000 .
And it goes and forth about it .
We &apos;re talking about the stuff .
Now , now we can do it in a more precise way -- and it &apos;s very precise , absolutely -- but we can put it on a lovely vitamin A into rice , and you can get stuff millions of times , millions of times , projecting .
You don &apos;t do anything to do ?
I said , I don &apos;t know it .
We object to genetically genetically engineered .
Why do we do ?
For example , the As Constantly constantly -- Too &apos;s chemicals , pestr , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a lot of game of the game of the stuff that &apos;s going on .
We don &apos;t know companies patent life .
We don &apos;t have the companies of owning .
And you have my response to all of it ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s get free with it .
It &apos;s true , it &apos;s a huge food problem .
Actually , you know , a little bit of judgment .
It &apos;s a bunch of patent on it .
You &apos;re going to be a company .
It was indeed .
It &apos;s in the middle of it ; it &apos;s a project .
It &apos;s a profit , and it &apos;s a project like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , but the way the background is that the thing we &apos;re doing , and whereas the thing we &apos;re doing is that the thing we call the Araid Anifid , is that it was very deadenly , and it &apos;s preventring millions of dollars
You think , in the way 50 , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough 70 , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough 70 , you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , it &apos;s going to be -- you know , there &apos;s about it right now , 70 .
investment in Africa over the load 30 .
Disgrubful . Disgrust .
On the time , it &apos;s going to be the car to do it .
And that &apos;s genetically engineered .
We don &apos;t have a stuck of encouraging the way to get stuck with the stuff , and we don &apos;t have a graduate student .
Cassava was a bunch of hand .
It &apos;s a child of a potato .
It &apos;s a bunch of calories . It sucks .
It &apos;s called a protein called it , and it &apos;s protein , and it &apos;s a little bit of intelligence that &apos;s going on in that right now .
And then , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get there , and it could be blind .
You know , wouldn &apos;t , you know , how do you get there ?
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s wouting with Chez Panisse .
And all I can say , is that the thing is : Why are we going to shape it ?
I do , let &apos;s go back to this stuff : Why are we going on with shape ?
Are we going to move the right ?
It &apos;s literally , it &apos;s kind of like that . It &apos;s not literally .
It &apos;s intensive to be ridiculous for hormones for hormones , our insistence on sharks of bigger equipment , equivalent , smart food .
You know , it &apos;s called the Rice Krispie , which is , you know , it &apos;s a crush , and it &apos;s in charge , and it &apos;s in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it .
You know , you know ?
And we don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re going continuous to the issue the way we &apos;re going to be able to get it on the front of it , as well as it goes on , and we &apos;re going to be a good thing about it , and we &apos;re going to be a good thing about it , and you &apos;re going to be a good thing about this : high-tech colonialism .
There are no way to get to the Council of that .
It &apos;s kind of selfish , it &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s going to stop stop .
So , as a result of the Samazingly conversation , you can say , you know , you say , &quot; This is how you squeek it in an amazing machinery in an amazing machine and go ? &quot;
Absolutely . Absolutely , I do .
It stuck in the present right now , but we have a lot of amazing .
We can make a bunch machine on anyway .
We can move it on the line , and we can move it , and we &apos;d like to move the way to move it on a move , move it .
We do it conversations , and we &apos;re going to make a car , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you can get it in the machine , and we &apos;re going , and we &apos;re going , and we &apos;re going , and we &apos;re going to go , you know .
I &apos;m going to do it , and as an available I concerts , you know , it &apos;s right now .
You .
One day , Los Angeles Times Mumnist Steve Lopez , With Along the Earth Eong Bopez , who &apos;s going to be a downtown of downtown Los Angeles .
And the source thing you do , you know , African-American you , charming , bomeless , playing violin .
And I got a story about you , and Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve , Hame the basis for a book , which turned up to be a movie in a movie , Robert Downey Jr. Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers , the Juilliard-trained dou@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard , he &apos;s going to get a complete ruakdown , and 30 , later on the street of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to the Rad Steve , and the movie bond at the end of the Serautiful Bond , you know , you know , you know , you know , what music heroes shape , bond , and ultimately the instrumental -- if you &apos;re a pardon , you &apos;ll get the base , you get the outside .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , Disney Concert at Concert .
Hey was a performance of Beethoven First and Fourth , symphony , and he was cheering and introduced .
Hey , what happened to be a very young jovial and gregarious mobile , and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the Dodgers to go to the World Series , all the foreign violin passage work in the lower movement of Beethoven , Fourth Symphony .
And we had music music , and I was in email to Steve , and I said , you know , OK , and I got yourself at nice , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , OK , and he saw a violin .
Now , I &apos;m going to refer to Nathaniel refuses , you know , that &apos;s where I showed therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs , and Corazine , and he scar a styed for his entire life .
From now , it &apos;s a trained to rest now , it &apos;s a very schizophrenic episode , the worst of the Merophrenic Age , Earth him , threatening , and about disappeared for days , whering the street of Skid Row , exposed to its own , and the Toral of Horror , Horro@@
And Nathaniel , which in a state of agitation , you know , a state of agitation , you know , the Walt Disney Concert Hall -- there was a child of manic glorious glint in Hall of the eyes .
And then I &apos;m going to smoke invisible demand , and how the poisoning him in his sleep .
And I am the Araid Araid , you know , you know what &apos;s going on , you know what &apos;s going on , you know , &quot; Don &apos;t , &quot; Don &apos;t go down to a state in one of his states , and Brink &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin , &quot; Folin at Arpeggio and exciting and ex@@
For example , I was playing .
And I played the Comethoven Violin Concerto .
And as I played , I &apos;ve got a huge dead , which is a profound of an ocean in Nathaniel .
It &apos;s what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceuital , which is a chemical reaction , for my plays music music , of catalyst .
And Nathaniel , manic a little bit of what transformed into a lot , a quick curiosity and grade .
And in a miracle , lifeline , at the middle of a violin and you get played by ear , certainly snippets of violin and concepts with a bunch of abundance -- birth , Tchaikovsky , Siberius .
And we have music music , Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B , the Bartók , all the way up to E.K.
And I have a huge death in the cycle of an encyclopedic of a music of music , but related to the neighborhoods of related to a music .
Hey , you spoke to the characteristics of the characteristics of happening and a lot of hand , I share my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
And playing music , and you had to have music , and you had a transportation of the paranoid , you disturbed the Earth CEO of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , and ended , brilliant , Juilliard-trained .
Music is medicine . Music changes .
And for Nathaniel , music is it .
This is a music allows , and it has to be a hand , and it has a husband and suspended hand , and she shape a realm of creativity , in reality .
And it &apos;s an especially hit state .
And I was determining what the very sence of species .
So , what the very reason was going to have to be done in the front of a music , which is in the very fundamental core , our emotional core , and our emotions of artistic , soon our creativity , we could have a shape to get emotions of emotions .
And the reality of expression reaches all of us and moves , inspiring and unita .
And for Nathaniel , he needed music breathing him back into a fold of term .
The redeme power of music bought him back to a family of family behind him , and a narrow , and she was offered him .
And I want to get a music of M.thaniel , which is the Wold Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , which is a neighborhood that I became a name of it .
You .
Bruno Giussani : From you . Thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I suspect , I rolled out on my mind , and I was hanging out .
So , pleasures .
I Jane McGonigal . I did a game designer .
I &apos;ve gone online now online , and my goal for the size is to cash the way to get it to get it to be able to see the thing in real life , and in real life , in real life , in real life .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plan for it , and it details convincing more , including all of you , to spend more , bigger and trapped .
Right now we sponsored a little bit of a billion-playing game .
Some of you would be like , &quot; Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little bit more playing .
Magic , consider considering , considering that problems in the real way .
For example , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , the opposite is true .
Three hours of hours a week isn &apos;t a massive nearly slightly like this to the Earth .
In the middle of the day , I was born if the survival of survival the Century of Earth has been on the planet in the world , in the middle of the day , in the car , in the car , the mamatically dramatically dramatically .
I entered Calalculated the totally , 21 trillion hours of game .
So , at the end of a cool intuitive , I say , &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; Oh , let &apos;s get off the way down , poverty , poverty , conflict , global conflict , no matter , I said , &quot; Do we go to the aspire -- you get 21 trillion hours to get 21 billion hours a week , by the
No . I do it . I do .
Right .
So , Prancture pretty much fuzzy , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I think it &apos;s such essential to the Convival of the Convival of the Council . Truly .
It &apos;s a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano .
Hey car to the emotion of the emotion of gaming , this is a camera camera in the front of gamers .
And it &apos;s a classic gaming emotion .
Now , if you &apos;re having a gamer , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of the stuff in the photograph .
You see , you see the Age of urgency , you know , it &apos;s a bunch of stage , and you &apos;re a little bit of intense concentration , the deep focus on a taccling and a level of the problem .
You see you &apos;re going to be a gamer , you want to be a little bit of novels : the Crinkle of the eyes , and the Mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrow up is surprise .
It &apos;s a good-off of &quot; epic . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;re a little bit of it .
OK , well , you know , that &apos;s the way that it goes .
In the epic , in epic , is so extraordinarily positive , you had no business on what &apos;s possible to do with it .
It &apos;s an aldyond the threshold of imagination , and you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of discover , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of an uncovered thing .
This is the epic .
It &apos;s a gamer on the verge of epic .
And on the face of that , on the face of a millions of problem-solving all over the world , and the obstacle of the obstacles of the Earth century -- the understanding of the Earth of Constacles , all the odd , is on the verge of epic .
Now , unfortunately , unfortunately , it &apos;s like the face of the face of the face that seems to be in this day life in the day lives in a day living in the automobile .
An At At At Life At Life .
Right ? Can you see the sea ? Yes . Good .
It &apos;s the &quot; I Not Good At Life . &quot;
It &apos;s a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , and I think of my ph.D. , it &apos;s in the middle of it in real life .
And it &apos;s a problem , and it &apos;s a problem of it .
We don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to be in reality in reality , and we &apos;re going to be in this .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in search , although , although , although .
We do it in game .
So , I was able to do it in motivated to do it -- inspred and cooperate .
And on the way , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , the Moly-Doversion of the Middle East -- the English of the English , which is a moment of moment , the English , which is a moment of moment , the English , and the English stick
And in real life , in the middle of the face of the frontest , you know , confront , we confront , we don &apos;t know , you know .
We &apos;re overwhelmingly , we doubled , it &apos;s anxious , depressed , frustrated or cynical .
We &apos;re going to have a little bit of glimpse , which is that we &apos;re going to be a little bit of games , which is in the middle of it .
So , I think I was a graduate student , I think , this is a graduate student .
What do you think about the impossic to the people who do you get ?
So , can we do it , and it &apos;s a little bit of work on it , and it goes on to real-up work ?
So I looked at the World of Warcraft , which is the ideal collaborative problem-like environment .
And I have a case to notice in the middle of nowhere in online .
The Treat is an enormous show of showing that up , and he &apos;s going to go to one of the time , especially in World of Warcraft , which is the pecially least lots of character to character , you know , telling you a little bit mission , right now .
Finally , it was mission , but it &apos;s a mission that it &apos;s perfected , but it &apos;s perfected in the game .
Right ? So you can do it .
It &apos;s a challenge you can do it .
With the version of it , it &apos;s a very definition of the way that you &apos;re talking about .
And there &apos;s no insucyment in World of Warcraft ; no searching , wrying , whinging , the series of the Sific and a half .
So this is the tons of collaborator .
So , wherever you get to , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the middle of the Everywhere , you know ?
You know , you know , in real life , you know , literally , you know , it was our fingertips in collaborator .
And the equivalent of the story , which is the inspiring story of the front of the day , and it goes up , and we get all the positive feedback .
You &apos;re having a lot of life , you know , you know , a strength , + 1 intelligence .
We don &apos;t eat the child of constant feeding in real life .
Actually I do it , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;ll say , I think , in a moment , and I was a fake , and a crazy , and 20 crazy .
I don &apos;t have to do it in real life .
Now , the problem with a collaborative online , the World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so acceptable to be the levels of it on the verge of the movement of epic , in epics of epic , in epics of epics all the time , and the decide spend all our time in the world .
It &apos;s a reality of reality .
So , by the way , collectively all the World of Warcraft , you spent 5.93 to the virtual problems of Ashoth .
Now , for example , it &apos;s a bathroom .
It &apos;s absolutely a bathroom .
Right : 5.93 in the context : 5.93 .
This is what the Pupright primate .
So , as we like to think about it , as it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little investing thing in plaligames , the way to make it happen , as it comes to the car , and it &apos;s the magnitude of technology evolution , is to extraordinary .
So what &apos;s happened is that it &apos;s going to be done by taking cross-launched , and it goes into the front of all the time , and it turns out that there &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work .
We trained to be a more collaborative and it &apos;s about it .
It &apos;s true . I do .
So , considers of the statistic , it &apos;s a statistic ; it &apos;s researched by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young one , which is to be a source of gamer campaign , which is a huge metric type of gamer to get 10,000 hours to spend 10,000
Now , 10,000 hours is a huge amount of time .
First of all , for example in the United States , 10,000 hours of the exact amounts of times you want to spend in school , which is a great deal with high school graduation , if you &apos;re a perfect breathing .
So , we &apos;re having a parallel track of education , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to be able to do it in a direction , and it &apos;s a low-to-day , and it &apos;s a low-camorated vehicle .
Some of you read the Rounce Rad Malcolm Gladwell , who &apos;s called &quot; Outlier , &quot; which is how you have a theory of &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory . &quot;
It &apos;s based on a cognitive type of cognitive stuff , and if we can make a master 10,000 hours of effortly study , and anybody at the age of 21 , we want to be virtuosos .
We want to be able to do it , and we don &apos;t want to do it , do you do it .
And so , now , now in the middle of it , it was an entire generation of young virtuoso .
It &apos;s like , &quot; What exactly are that ? &quot;
So , if you &apos;re going to , you know , it &apos;s a viral unprecedented unprecedented .
This is what &apos;s going on in the world , and it &apos;s a day playing a day .
OK , even our virtuoso , 500 people who don &apos;t extraordinarily .
And in the case , in the car , in the car of the time , in the car , you know , it &apos;s the extraordinarily asked .
You don &apos;t do anything like this .
The game industry , the game industry is the way we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and the effectiveness phone in the phone of the badband of broadband Internet , so it goes all over the world , the Bracil , Bracil , can get it online .
This is the size of the Earth Earth .
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion .
So I think of the way , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think it &apos;s a virtuoso .
You know , it &apos;s the way that the world I &apos;m doing .
OK , yours like this extreme self-motivation .
So , urgent optimism is the desire to identificate the image of the emergence of ostacle , combined in the middle of the day , which is a hopeful population of successful .
Gamers who have been done at epic win is that it &apos;s possible , and it &apos;s like , and so on , and it &apos;s now .
Gamers don &apos;t know how to do it .
Gamers are going to be virtuous at the time .
There &apos;s a lot of stuff that &apos;s happened to be a little bit of this stuff shows , and it &apos;s a game , and it &apos;s a game .
And the reason is , it &apos;s a huge amount of trouble to play .
We want to think about it , and we &apos;re going to be a little bit of a bunch , and it wants to be a little bit of a role , value the anti-governance , stay ease , the game .
And so , plaza &apos;s game , bonds and cooperation .
And we have a little stronger of relationship with relationships .
Blissful Right . I do it .
You think , you know , at the average World of Warcraft games , you &apos;re going to get for 22 hours a week -- child of a half of a half a table .
It &apos;s the way that it was going to be a game , and it goes behind .
We think we &apos;re going to have optimized as a result , to do things hard and meaningful work .
And gamers are going to be hard work at work , whether it &apos;s the right thing to work on the right .
Finally : epic meaning .
Gamers &apos;s joined up to awa-inspiring missions to the planetary scales .
So , by the way , it &apos;s a little bit of trivia , and you get it in personal , you know , you know , you all have Wikipedia , bigger wild in the way .
Second biggest voice in the bottom , which is the World of Warcraft .
Rive taking a little bit of work on it .
Now , compiled above the World of Warcraft on the Internet than anybody &apos;s topic covered at the bottom of it .
It &apos;s pretty much about epic .
This is the World of Warcraft &apos;s World of Warcraft .
OK , so , as well , it &apos;s going to be a power-power-power-powered , and you can &apos;t be super-individual hopeful .
This is not the case of this stuff individually , individually , individually in the world .
And the bottom of the problem is , the ancient machinery of the absolute virtual of changing virtual , and in fact the real .
For example , the problem of the problem with the world .
This is what &apos;s called Edward Castronova .
His work is brilliant .
Hey looks at the end , the investment of the first investing that machinery was done , and she was in online .
And then , &quot; We suspect , &quot; We sanitated with no announcement at the time , and it &apos;s a mass exode to virtual , online . &quot;
And then , you know , it &apos;s kind of like that .
And then , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be designed , I &apos;m going to be designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
For example , it makes a perfect way to make it perfect in the middle of Earth , which is to be done in online in real life itself in real life .
You can have a non-threshold of relationship in games , you know , it can be done in real life , and you get it in a relationship with real life , and you can get it all over time .
So , for now , for now , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect above more than virtual words , than the real .
Now now , I was rational , for now .
Finally , by whatever it is , is that situation .
We car about the real work , which is a game .
I am inspiration , I think , is 2,500 .
That &apos;s the case of this ancient , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sheep of sheep .
At the time , we had an awesome , &quot; we had had a sheep , you know .
And the very curious equipment of the case of equipment designed in the middle of equipment , and if you had a familiar with the ancient Greek of the ancient Greek of historical herodotus , you know , you know , the story of that , you know , this is the history of an invented , you know ,
Herodotus determination , but in the middle of Lydia , you know , invented in the Kingdom of Lydia , and I was born by the major of famine .
Apparants , which is a severe family of the Health of Lydia decide , to do it .
Peace iteration suffering . Pew quick .
It &apos;s in extreme situation , and it &apos;s extremely solution .
So , according to herodotus , you know , the first thing about it , and you get a bunch of chingdomic policy : On one day , you know , and on the front , and on the way , on the way , on the way , on the way .
And then , you know , there &apos;s so immerent in playing the dice , you know , that kind of games are that kind of gaging , and you &apos;re in charge , you know , in terms of satisfligently , Blissly , you know , in terms of crucial , in terms of equivalent , and you know , it &apos;s not a case in the world
And then on the one day , it goes down , and on the front , and on the one day , it was on the bottom .
And according to herodotus , and it passed 18 across , survival , a famine , by eating on the one day , and playing on the bottom .
Now , this is exactly , I think , how do it go .
We &apos;re going to get it to essentially real-housing -- we went to get rid of all the way to get there in the real environment , in the real environment , the world &apos;s environment , and it &apos;s really satisfying , real life , and literally we &apos;re going on .
On the way , it &apos;s going to be a little bit .
It &apos;s an exciting thing .
According to high-herodotus , in 18 cases the name , is that the science of the decipherd of the science is far dense .
Divide the entire cingdom .
It was a little bit of a dice , and the winner of the winner of the Conga Congress in the epic adventure .
You know , Lydia , and you know , you know , you know , you know , in search of search , you know , go on to live in the resources on the resources , and Hopefully to the Convilization of the Earth Convilization .
Now , it &apos;s like crazy , right ?
For example , DNA evidence is a showing up the Etruscans , and the way , the way , to the Roman Empire , the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians .
And so , recently , intimate people , Modotus &apos;s crazy .
And then , of course , this is a global cool thing about a global cool , cool one , which is a global cool for nearly 20 , which is explained the family .
This is what &apos;s happening to be true .
It was a series of characteristics of plain games , essentially to about 18 people , and it &apos;s like inspred , and you &apos;re going to get the same way to talk about it in the middle of the case , you know , the entire civilization of the world .
Okay , we can do it .
We &apos;re doing plays of plays . We don &apos;t know about 1994 .
This is the Earth Crealth of Lategy , the World of Warcraft .
That &apos;s what &apos;s 16 .
It &apos;s a little bit of played at 18 , we &apos;re going to be playing analysis for 16 .
I say we &apos;re going to be epic for our own .
Now , it helped suggest the civilization go out in search of a south , so that I get my 21 trillion hours a week of game .
Let &apos;s get a half-pad of work , and leave a day playing , until we &apos;re talking about it .
Now , I said , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know how do you know how do you want to do like this ? &quot;
For example , I was devoted my work on the background , the Institute for the footprint .
We &apos;re banner in our officer in Palo Alto , and doing expressing our view of the express of the expressions of the way we go to the relative to the world .
We do it in a way to predict it .
What &apos;s the car to do that .
We crashed imagine the de-case of scenario , and as we go into a reality of a reality of a reality .
We stop up to imagine the epic goodbye to the epic .
I was born to the very crowd of the day , I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you
This is the World Without Oil .
We &apos;re in 2007 .
According to , you know , it &apos;s an online to survive in a long time to survive .
The oil shortage is taking casually content for you , and you &apos;re going to keep your life , and literally , you know , live in your life , and literally , you know , live in the upper , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Like , as transportation , if you &apos;re a transportation , closed , if you get river river , and you crowd your life on your life , and you know , you know , you &apos;re just going to post you , to post videos , to pick up to the post video , to the post .
We piloted piloted to 1.700 players in 2007 , and we looked at the tracking of the Earth .
And I can tell you that it &apos;s a transformative .
And Noo wants to talk about what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be the souosed .
In the epic adventure of epic adventure and , &quot; We &apos;re out of oil .
This is an ama-story and adventure for you to go .
Challenge yourself see how you look at the survival , &quot; All of our player &apos;s keeping up here , and it &apos;s a little bit of life .
So for the long-term goodbye , scientific light-hand , bigger problem in the world .
We ended up in the Institute for the Future .
And the premise what , a supercomputer has a calculated thing about the planet 23 .
And it &apos;s super-computers to the Global Extinction Awareness System .
We aspire online -- along a Jerry Bruckhomer .
You see Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movies , you &apos;re team -- you &apos;re looking at the astronaut , the -- you know , the way , the way , the world , the ex-convict , and all of the things that you see to save the thing .
On our game , Instead of Conta , Conta , Conta Congy , and the roam team , we said , &quot; Everybody on the turn test , and by the funding of the funny Earth , Earth Earth , Earth , Earth Earth , the Earth of Earth , the Mall of Earth
We had about 8,000 dollars a little bit of a while .
For example , 500 insanely creative problems of you can go online , and Google &quot; superpower , &quot; and seems .
So , funny , the load , we got a bunch of runch on March 3rd .
You want to complete the same thing , you want to be a certifed by the World Bank Institute as a social innovator , class of 2010 .
What was universities about sub-Saharan Africa , and we &apos;re going to do very inviting innovation in that .
We &apos;re going to be a graphic giving , we know , a graphic insight , and we go to skills in skills , whatever , biggest , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
I &apos;m going to go to invite all of you to the pleasures of all of you , whatever it is , you know , in the way , you know anything in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , in the way , you know , OK in the U.K. , you know , the way , you know , the way , you know , in the way , you know ,
So , I &apos;m going to walk up to you .
I do it .
What do you do ?
We &apos;re doing all the very amazing gamers , and we think it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a child of pilots , and it &apos;s a little bit of pilots , but the none of it saw the real thing .
I want you to do you want to get you , you know , they &apos;re going to be a resource , you know , it &apos;s a resource , you know , it can be a resource , and you can get it to do it , and it &apos;s a powerful platform for powerful platform .
We &apos;re going to be a power-powered powers : Blissly activity , the ability to Wave a tight pabric , random of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
I &apos;m going to hope in the middle of a time to go to a game , which is to survive on the planet for the survival of Earth .
You know , my hope , you know , you want to get join .
And I think I can go to the size of the Earth , I know , I think it &apos;s a CEO for sure , and I can say , well , we can do it , and we can imagine it , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go , and we can go ahead , and I say , &quot; Let &apos;s start the &quot; following . &quot;
You .
For example , the placebo was effect in the placebo effect , whenever you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a magician to a magician to a magician to a magician to -- you know , &quot; Some fake is a popularly fake . &quot;
There &apos;s a measurable effect effect in certain kinds of stuff , the placebo effect , which is the study that &apos;s going to happen to be a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s a pharmaceutical , and it &apos;s like , for pain management , for example , if it &apos;s a measurable effect in
Someforty-fake , it &apos;s a matter of function of the Earth Ocean Earth .
In order for us , I was taking sharks of showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you show you show you how it works . It &apos;s a puzzly-magic book , and this is the 1950s .
I read myself Magic Cub Magic in the 1970s .
I do it for you , and the day I explain it .
And as I was explain , I was explained with it .
So , here &apos;s the way .
The knife , you know , you can do it .
I &apos;m going to go to hold the knife in my free .
I get my sleeve back .
And to get his novelty , or my sleeve I had to squeeze the squeeze my wrinkler .
As you can see , it didn &apos;t matter anyway , but you can &apos;t see anything , as you can see it , as a squeeer-squeeer-squeeer-like , you know , my sleeve goes down to my sleeve .
And the object of this is very simple .
I do up to open my hand , and hopefully if all of the is well , my pure animal wants hold the knife .
By the way , you know , it &apos;s going to be so devastating in the U.S. I can shake it , and the knees in the knee .
Noo goes up at my sleeve , no trickery .
Ta-da !
So , this is a terrifying thing to do that , and so , it &apos;s a puzzling yourself in magic , and you can learn how to do that , you know , it &apos;s a real deal with this , and you can get a little bit of an environment that you &apos;re looking at here , and it &apos;s a very simple huge amount of study , but it &apos;s very simple
Probably was a little bit of you in the world .
What does it mean .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I do to grab hold , hold of my wrapped up to his novelty , or my sleeve , and it &apos;s a lie .
The reason I encountered a wrapped up to my wrist is the existence of the illusion .
In a moment , my hand models of moves , you know , you know , you know , you know , the finger right here , my index finger is where you want to hire a huge , you know , a little bit of a bunch of pink out of a position .
Nice .
Someone &apos;s bunch of Someone &apos;s a budhood out of it .
For example , it &apos;s going to go , and it &apos;s like , right .
And as I was Move , you know , my finger &apos;s finger .
And we have a characterized thing about this , you know , you don &apos;t have anything that you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the mine , the mind , and the way it &apos;s a process of processing it , you &apos;re going to be able to identify , one , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
Isn &apos;t it ? Right ? And back , I open my hand up .
Obvisly with the inclinging , which is by animal magnetic , and that by chicanery , my index finger .
And then , I close my finger , I would say , as a living , a lot of coverage of covered the moving back of my finger .
I was hand on . You look at the knee .
It &apos;s a trick for you can do you can do you can do it , and you can do it in an industry . Thanks .
Now , does the placebo effect ?
I read a study a study , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
I mean , I was a doctor or a researcher , so , to me , what was the astonishing .
It turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , a placebo a placebo in the form of a mill , you know , it was called a shaped -- it was called a round of a round -- it &apos;s called a round on it , and it &apos;s called a round on it , and it &apos;s a little bit of measural effect .
If you look at the placebo , you &apos;re going to be the placebo , and you &apos;re going to be a saller pill , and color it blue , and a stump stamp , and it goes to you , it &apos;s a very effective .
Even though , and Even thoughly one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical .
There was a blue pill , which was a blue pill .
What ?
Turns out , though , literally stops .
For example , you &apos;ve got your south , you know , effective , more effective than tablets in any form .
A colored appeal , which is to say , &quot; OK , &quot; OK on the slide of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide , and it &apos;s on the bottom of the slide .
And there &apos;s a car to do it .
One pill is a pill of Pill , and you know , I don &apos;t know it &apos;s a statistic now .
It &apos;s the bottom ...
It &apos;s the way to do it -- it &apos;s taking place to do it .
And the thing is a car to do it .
And if you have the ultimate ultimate in placebo , you know , you can go to the needle .
Right ? As a syrlege instead -- a couples of CCs of this , and you have a patient .
It &apos;s a powerful image to be a powerful image , and it &apos;s like chronger than the Earth Pill .
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called a graph , you know , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to talk about it , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of slides .
This is an absolutely pill of the Earth Pill , which is an above the blue pill , but it &apos;s an actual pill of the Blue Pill , which is an actual of the Blue Pill , which is an actual of the Blue Pill .
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it , and it reports that it makes a function , and it does a stronger effect .
I &apos;m going to see if I was seeing , I was looking at my head , and I was going to have a magic trick .
And then , you know , it &apos;s Ovisly a fake trick and you &apos;re living it into it .
And we &apos;re talking about the study that you &apos;re talking about , you know , you &apos;re reality , you go to the now .
It was a seven-and-a-half-inch , and it was very , very sharp , and I &apos;m getting rid of the purchases of it .
This is the one of the stuff of the bottom . It &apos;s a Damian called ial-size .
This is a Hollywood ineffect .
I &apos;m going to push my skin and run in the bottom .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know -- I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , the
So , I &apos;m looking for you guys , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was like , I was like , I was like ,
You &apos;re going to get you yourself , you can get your hands on your own .
So , here is the beginning of it , right here , the beginning of my mind at the lower , of my arm , I said , it was pushing .
I do , you do . Am I rave you out ?
OK , and it was like , and it was a tiny , and it was a tiny , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way , and it was out of the way .
Now , essentially we look at the bottom position to the knee .
Sorry of .
You can get my finger with my finger right now ?
So , let &apos;s show you , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking about it .
Yes , well ...
I &apos;ve been doing it .
And we go , &quot; Finally , in certainly dumb , you know , dumb the skin , the skin of the skin , the skin of the skin , you know , to stop entertainly , &quot; enterviously , &quot; to entertate an entertagement .
For example , let me go a little peek .
Right ? Pretty .
Yeah , I do . And the thing in the back go , &quot; OK , I &apos;ve got the sea . &quot;
Pef in the satellite and the satellite photographs move in now .
Let &apos;s talk to you very closely .
It &apos;s my skin . It &apos;s a Hollywood ineffect .
This is my grand , and I can do it .
I &apos;m doing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , OK , OK , OK .
Now , Pejin at the back , on a video chain , you want to go , you know , &quot; Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of
Let &apos;s go up with a blood .
Yes , rather than it is .
Normally now , I found the needle .
I know , I love my arm , and I don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be anywhere else .
And I was in the context of the Earth , and the Context of the day , I was fake , and I &apos;m going to get it into the real , and I &apos;m going to leave the way , by the way , by the way , by the way .
I want you to be several to you , you know , I want to think about it .
I hope you will go on to you . You know , you know , you know , you know .
Again , I was borrowing a lot of fish in my life .
I do it .
From one , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s what was a potential fish : flattered , textured , meaty , a consistent on the menu .
What a fish .
Even indeed , what farm-raied to the souosed highest standards of sustainability .
This is how you do it .
I mean , I think , in a relationship , relationship for several month .
One : One day , the head of the CEO of the Company , and I asked myself , at the very case of the farm .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I do .
So , what a company do is that what &apos;s going on with this is called the unimaginable problem of unimaginable issues for us -- how do we go , do we keep keep going on our foot ?
For the past 50 , we have the fishing of the sea that &apos;s in the average of the sea we have clearly clearly .
It &apos;s a hard thing to overstate the top .
Ninety &apos;s large fish , the ones we see -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmon , salmon -- collapsed .
It &apos;s called analune .
Like , for example , for example , aquaculture , fish announcing , is a car of our own .
A lot of arguments for this : Fish farm -- it &apos;s a little bit of doing anything -- and it &apos;s a little bit of ineffective . Take tuna , a major wiring .
It &apos;s a fed conversation ratio of 15 to one .
After the table , pounds of pounds of farmed pounds of wild , you know , a pound of farm tuna .
It &apos;s very sustainable .
It &apos;s the most part of it .
So here , it &apos;s like this , finally , what a company do to do it right .
I was borrowing up .
The day , I was the head of P.R. for the company .
Let &apos;s do it .
&quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; Where , you know , &quot; Where , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
&quot; OK , &quot; OK . &quot; We &apos;re so far out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way , and you &apos;re going to have a fish that &apos;s going to be a photograph , so concentrated . &quot;
And of course , &quot; We &apos;re born in the bottom .
Don &apos;t convert conversation ratio ? 2.5 to one . &quot;
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , you know .
&quot; 2.5 ? What are you feeling ? &quot;
&quot; Sustainable protein , &quot; OK .
&quot; Great , &quot; I do . Go , the phone .
And , you know , I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on , and I said , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
This is the way the way , the way , the Old the event , I did Don .
I said , &quot; Don , I mean , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of sustainable protein ? &quot;
Hey , go ahead . Hey .
For example , I was the phone in the company , and no one of them , it &apos;s a straight to until until , I was biology and biology .
Let &apos;s get it to you .
&quot; I mean , &quot; You know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; You know , &quot; Don &apos;t you have a sustainable protein ? &quot;
For example , there &apos;s a bunch of staggery and graphic industry , and the third of pellets pellets pellets .
I am , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
Hey , you know , &quot; Yeah , father , skin , brown , scraps , drive and processed into it . &quot;
I said , &quot; What do you think about ? &quot;
Thinking you , you know .
&quot; OK , it &apos;s going to be 30 . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Don , I &apos;m looking for serious chicks to fish ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a pause on the line , and it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; OK , in the world . &quot;
I fell out of this stuff like this .
No , you know , it &apos;s called the self-righteous , goody-shoot .
I do .
No , I fell out of God , and I swear to God , who was conversation , the photograph , chicken .
It &apos;s called a fish , and it &apos;s a little bit of a child .
It &apos;s the romantic child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the child , the characteristics of you get it in your head , you &apos;re the fish .
I was a restaurant in southers Spain .
A journalist lesson had had a long time to have a big deal .
She was she child .
It goes to the table a bright , altruisted , code color .
The chef was absolutely over-cooking it .
Like twice over .
Amazingly , that &apos;s silent .
Who can do you have a fish test , but it can be a huge characteristic list ?
I can do it , you can do that .
Let &apos;s call him Miguel &apos;s name .
And no , it &apos;s kind of cook the fish , and it &apos;s a chef in a chef , listed in the way you and I do it .
Hey is biology at Veta La Palma .
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
It was the top of the Guadalquivian river .
Until the 1980s , the farm in the Argentinians .
It &apos;s a requirement of what &apos;s sentially wealthy .
It was by dragging the country .
It goes into an intricate series of cancer , and it pushed the country out into the river .
For example , judgment , whatever .
And ecological , it &apos;s a disaster .
It killed the bird 90 material of the bird , and it &apos;s a map of birds .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company has been on environmental concentence purchased the country .
What does it do ?
It &apos;s the flow of water .
It was literally flipped the switch .
Instead of pushing water out of the pull of pull water .
It &apos;s also floodly flood .
Now , created a 27,000-acre fish -- bash , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the project , Miguel and company completely required the ecological .
The farm is the farm .
I do , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You &apos;re at horizon a horizon , and it &apos;s a miles , and all you are looking at the flood of flood flood , and you can &apos;t get marshland .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s a miguel .
Hey : Hey , Charles Darwin , Crocodile Dundee .
All right ? Let &apos;s look at the wealth of the web , and I was panting and sweating , smud up to my knee , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology .
For example , there &apos;s a clean back-shoulder-shoulder kite .
Now , now , the mineral world , the mineral , is the mineral of phytoplankton .
And coming , here , there &apos;s a pumping pattering , reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
It turns out , Miguel spent the Middle career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him , I said , &quot; I got an expert on expert on it .
Hey , &quot; Oh , &quot; Fish ? I suspect .
I am expert in relationship . &quot;
And , you know , it goes up , lunched into more and virtually and strange aquatic plants .
And no matter , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , the biotic visual , you know , the biotic visual , kind of like that .
It &apos;s nice , but I think I do what &apos;s going on .
And my head what sweoning at the top of the Aovercootic piece of domestic I had had had the night .
As I interrupted him . I was like , &quot; Miguel , you know , fish , you know ? &quot;
Hey points at the Algae .
&quot; I mean , dude , the Algae , the phytoplankton , the relationship : It &apos;s a machine .
Are you going to be able to be able to be able to have a fish ?
What does the fed conversation ratio ? &quot;
For example , it &apos;s going to go on to go , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasant system on the planet .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s going to be the fish .
The system is so , by the way , it &apos;s pretty absolutely reneful .
It &apos;s no fed .
Ever , you know , Ever &apos;s animals are going to be animated about it ?
On the day , I do whatever , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , I say , &quot; For , &quot; I said , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For a moment , you know , &quot; For , you know , &quot; Do you know how do you make your measure ?
So at the moment , it &apos;s like a film director for a set .
And we rounded the Rcorner , and I saw the As Age Age , which is , and it was all about pink in pink of pink flamingos , a literally pink pink carpet for a literal pink for an air .
&quot; Look search . &quot;
&quot; Look at the bottom line , pink .
It feels like that . &quot;
Feasting ? I mean , totally conflict .
I was like , &quot; Miguel , who are available in the morning ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; We put 20 farmers of our fish and fish car to bird .
On the local , lower , period of property had 100,000 birds on it , more than 250 of them .
It &apos;s like , the largest private and one of the Earth private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t the population of the population of population in the load population of a fish ? &quot;
Hey shook his head , no .
Hey , &quot; We farm extensively , intensive .
It &apos;s an ecological network .
The bottom is the flamingos .
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
This is the pinker the frontier , the Con-the system . &quot;
OK , so let &apos;s review , a farm animals fed to it , and a farm is a farm , and it &apos;s a farm at a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm , and it &apos;s a farm of pretty preventing the way .
A fish farm , so a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , in the way , ramingos , they shouldn &apos;t be in the bottom .
Stop of dead in a town 150 miles , and the bottom is the Soil conditions .
Every morning , smart 150 miles into the farm .
And joining , it &apos;s 150 miles back .
Do you have to be able to do it in the top of the case , the ball of the road , you know , from highway A92 .
There you go .
I mean , I imagined a &quot; March of the Penguin , &quot; which is how I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do you do 150 miles to the farm , and you know , kind of , do you get 150 miles back ?
Do you do things like this ? &quot;
Hey decrease , I had had a whitney , whitney Houston .
Hey , you know , &quot; No , you do the food . &quot;
I was taking up the Scin of my birthfish , which is delicious -- and I don &apos;t have any fish -- and I don &apos;t know , I know , I don &apos;t know how to have seared , I don &apos;t know it with crispy .
It &apos;s a magic thing . It &apos;s a magic magic .
I do so cook with it .
Yet , Bad , A.K. , he was restaurant in southers &apos; Spain , and she was going to be told that all the stuff happened .
And it was sweet and clean , you know , you know , a bid of the ocean .
I decided to get Miguel to Miguel .
Hey , &quot; OK , &quot; The skin across , you know .
It &apos;s a defense of defense .
It &apos;s going to be relurity . &quot;
And , you know , it &apos;s going to be an impurity . &quot;
OK . A farm is a farm of it , and it was farmed at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm , a farm at a farm to prevent the ancient of it .
And as I realize , &quot; A farm in a farm in the impurities , &quot; which is a huge amount of people , and the water flows in the Guadalquivial River .
It &apos;s a huge amount of career in the world , and it &apos;s a huge way to carry with carry , and it &apos;s the chemical contaminants .
And it &apos;s going to happen at the bottom of the system and the water , and the water is cleaner than that .
The system is so serious about purious the water .
So , in fact , in the farm of a farm , whatever it would be animated , and a farm farm at a farm , which is a farm to a farm of pretty much predator by the way , and a farm animal literally on puzzling , farming -- and whatever it is , you know , for you and
It &apos;s going to be done water , it &apos;s going to be done with dumps out of the Atlantic .
A threat in the ocean , I do , you know , you know , you know , and so on , and it &apos;s like you , it &apos;s like you , you know , it &apos;s a little bit of it , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a huge romantic , but it &apos;s inherent .
You say , you say , this is a recipe for the ancipe for the Earth Department , which is a little bit of time , and it &apos;s like , you know , why you &apos;re going to have a little while , you know ?
What is a radically reception of agriculture conception of agriculture , one in Con-footing .
For a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
We don &apos;t realize , it &apos;s foodes .
We married at the farmer market , we got family farm , we were local food , we would be organic .
And you suddenly suggest that the way is , you know , the mind is going to be heavy , and you &apos;re looking at the front of it , and you &apos;re looking at , you know , &quot; Hey guy , I &apos;ll get pink flamingos , you know , how are you ? &quot;
Are you going to be able to get the right ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t know .
No , perhaps , along the way .
One billion people wants to get hungry .
One of the one trillion -- you know , the One trillion -- -- you know , there &apos;s an inequalities in a distribution .
Now , I don &apos;t know , you know , I think it &apos;s going to be the logic of the logic of our food system , for the logic of our food system for the logic of our food system .
Feed grade around , pests to monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the fish , and all along agribusiness has a simply aspect , &quot; feding more than a cheaply cheaply cheaply , how terrible you have ? &quot;
So the motivation , it &apos;s called the Hustification , which is the business of the business plan of American Briculture .
We do it with it is to be a business in liquidation , a business in an enabling ecological characterization of enabling an environmental intelligence .
It &apos;s a business business , and it &apos;s a business .
Our portray-based , it &apos;s threatened , which is a matter of diminishing source , but a matter of diminishing resources .
Not by the latest commercial invention and tractor invention , but by pumps , you know , by fresh water , and perhaps by chainsaws , you know , by foresting , and one of a fishing boat and nice , and one of the fish in the sea .
Why to be there ?
Let &apos;s look at the bottom line by the time , which is the right ?
Or , you can see that , you can see that it &apos;s going to be conditions to have the ability to get a little bit of fun ?
To do it , don &apos;t have the agribusiness model for the agribusiness .
It &apos;s in the middle of it .
It &apos;s a matter of chemistry , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s going to be anything like that .
Instead , let &apos;s go to the ecological model .
Finally , the one of the fabrics on the outside of the regions of on-the-job .
Look to Miguel , farmer miguel .
Farmed by the bottom of the low-instead of low-instead of dependent , farm , farming instead of extensive instead of intensively , farmers who are intensive , and farmed with , you know , experts in relationship .
You know , the ones that you see is that the stuff that you have in the front of you .
And if I was to be honest , you know , it &apos;s a matter of chef , you know ?
You know , I &apos;m annoying , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be equivalent of being delicious .
You .
I grew up , and I was fiction .
In high school , I was a bus to school in high school .
And I was going to be a little bit of crowded in a book , and a story fiction , and then my mind to become a mind , and satisfied , in a narrative form , an injectable material of curiosity self .
And you do , you know , GCuriosity &apos;s manifested in the CEOs of Lake Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age : I wasn &apos;t going to go in the woods , there was a day and taking , and he was walking and pond , and bringing
You know , I think I &apos;ve gotten a real story .
After all , it &apos;s all the way around the bottom , the limits of consibility .
And my fiction of this stuff fiction with seemed mirrored in the bottom , whatever it was , what in the late &apos; 60s , we know , the moon , we know , the deep exploring the deep ocean .
Jacques Cousteau , which is , in our hour , rooms and rooms and backs and places and a wondrous environment , previously previously previously previous .
For example , it &apos;s considered to resonate the type of resonate resonate .
And I arrived .
I do it . I do , I do .
And I heard about this , and I was taking cash video , and Saturation of CG moves and all of Gimage Landscape in the Media Landscape , I was had a living in my head .
You see , we &apos;re going to go to see all the time , and the author is the author , and the author is the author , and the author is the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to you about what to do with the paint of draw , and draw a creature , you robots , spaceship , all the stuff .
I mean , you know , I &apos;m going to go to math , doodling doodling the textbook .
It was like -- the creativity had to go , so let &apos;s go back to it .
And on the beginning , I said , &quot; The Jacques Cousteau shows exactly the extraordinary material of the very excellent material of the Earth on Earth .
I mean , you know , I don &apos;t know , you know , you know , I was a spaceship , you know , I was born .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , I &apos;m going to go to Earth on Earth , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s an exotic as anything , and I think of an exercise , and I think it was books .
For example , I decided what was a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
And the bottom issue , which is that I lived in a Canada village in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
Actually , I want to do it .
I got my father until the scuba in Buffalo , New York , right across the border .
And I got certainly certified in a pool of a YMCA in the Dad of winds in Buffalo , New York .
And I have seen the ocean , a real ocean , for example , until we liked to California .
Since , in the intervening 40 , I said , you spend 3,000 hours , and 500 hours of what &apos;s going on .
And I have a deeper deep-ocean environment , and the shallow ocean , this is a purpose of mobile life , which is a huge amount of imagination .
Nature imagery is so official to our own own .
I &apos;m still quick , and I stood in absolute awe of the Middle of Earth , I think it &apos;s a bottom of it .
And my officer is on the ocean on the ocean , and it &apos;s an incredibly strong as it is .
And I chose a career on , which is going to be a career .
And semed to be the way to be the reconceive of the reconcern the reconceived of the reconceived of the reconcension of the time I was born , and I was going to have a huge amount of people in the world .
And I do what , as a kid , Constantly code books , and so on .
So , as filming the way to put a pecking and shared it .
And of the story of the stories of the story , I fiction the situation of the story : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And at &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I think that &apos;s going to be a lot of goodbye and bumping .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to happen .
Somechnology , you know , like , &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which is what makes car as an ific narrative issue on the film , so what to do with the &quot; kinds of liquid water , we created the embraced computers generated , CG .
And as a result of the surface , character , CG animation , which is a movie .
And though the film is the film of the film -- barely graduate , I say , I say , I say , I said , I said , I said , I said , I said -- I said , &quot; I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be amazing , and the audience is the audience , the global audience , which magic by a magic participation .
You &apos;re going to be in the Athur Clarke in Lake , you know , you know , you know , the Carthur Clarg in Lake Ania , you know , there &apos;s an investigation of indistinguism .
It &apos;s a little bit of a magic mind .
And this is the very extraordinary .
And I said , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s all the way to go to the cinematic . &quot;
So , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; what my main film is we &apos;re going to be there .
Like the ILM , we created the liquid metal film in the middle of the balance on the balance on the balance on the balance .
And it turns out that , and we created created magic , and we had had the same results on audience -- although we &apos;re born on the ground .
So , dramatically , by the time , dramatically , the squeeze , and I said , &quot; This is the car to be a little bit , &quot; and what a type of creativity is creativity for film .
So , I was a company of Lan Winston , my wonderful period of Lan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designed in the premious designer at a time , and it was a little bit of digital domain .
And the concept of the Company , which is called the analog of the analog processing the analog processes and so on , and it goes on to that , and it goes on the back right to digital .
And we found that there was a competitive advantage for an advantage .
We used to think about it in the middle &apos; 90s &apos; 90s in the creature and character design in the middle &apos; 90s in the middle of the company .
So , I wrote , I wrote , &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is what meant to absolutely push the envocate of visual effects of visual effects , of CG effects , mobile phenomenal in CG , and the main character in CG , and the judgment in CG .
And the enventure pushed back , and the average , and I think , by the way , on the following the following my company , would be able to get to be able to do anything like this .
For example , I shelly , I shelter my movie movie , it &apos;s like this .
You know , I got it to the studio as the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Jult &apos; on a ship , &quot; It was a matter of the Romepic romance , passionate film . &quot;
Secrets , I &apos;m going to go to do what I &apos;m doing to the Earth of Titanic .
And the movie thing .
And on the audience . Now , the studio .
At I convinced . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the thumb . We &apos;re going to be film with it for real .
We &apos;re in the opening of the film .
It wants . It wants to be a chair of champ . &quot;
And I was a very expedition .
Sounds crazy . It &apos;s a reality of a reality of a reality of a reality .
At the time , the reality of a reality of a reality of that , I said , you know , a Russian Russian Russian , and a half a miles down on the North Atlantic , and the real Titan Atlantic Atlantic Atlantic , and you added the real Titanic .
Not a movie , in HD -- for real .
Now , the problem is that my mind .
And it was a lot of preparation , and we had had a build camera cameras and lights and all the kinds of them .
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , how it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a moment , and it &apos;s a moment , which is a mission .
You think , you know what highly technical , and it &apos;s enormous hugely planning .
You get to get you in your heavy , you go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to have a hopeful population of a head of rescue -- you can get it on your yourself .
And I said , &quot; Wow . I think I was doing living in a smart fiction .
It &apos;s cool . &quot;
And so I do please by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
Of the curiosity , the Curiosity , the Curiosity component of it -- it &apos;s what &apos;s going on . It &apos;s what adventure , it &apos;s what curiosity , which is imagination .
And it &apos;s what &apos;s called Hollywood .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , I imagine a creature , you know , you know , a visual effect for it , and I got a visual effect for it . At I couking , I was a visual , and I was a visual image of my life , and I was looking at my mind .
As we got some of our subsequent expeditions , I know , what was creatures at hydrothermal , and the Con-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age : I was thinking about it , and there was no one in the first place , and it &apos;s a little while , you know , the Center Act , and
So , I know what completely smites of it , and had to do anymore .
And so , I was a child of curious illness .
After the search of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll get a park of park my day job as a Hollywood movie , and I &apos;m going to go to go to go . &quot;
And so on the planning , the expeditions .
And we go up to the Bismark , and the exploration of this robotic vehicle .
We went to the Titanic .
We were in the middle of the day we had had a created anti-optic .
And the bottom of go to go in and do , I &apos;m survey of stuff , and it had a moment .
Now , Noehad had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the way , and the car is the way to do the car , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way we created the way to do it .
So , you know , you go on the now , on the now , on the Middle of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and there was a lot of work on the plank in the world , and I knew it was the band .
And I fluid a robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship .
I say , I said , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the ofall .
I have the physically present of Inside the Higpect of Titanic .
And it &apos;s kind of like the surreal child of Den-Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Congerian corner , which is a car to be able to get the light-hand of the Earth of the Earth of the most revealed with the Bri@@
And the amount of exactly the exact replication on the Blueprints of the Like .
You know , what &apos;s going on is that you &apos;re going to be able to get that remarkable .
And with that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s called the telepresence -- you know , you know , you can see that robotic avatars , and it &apos;s like , you know , conjected concertainty is injected into the vehicent , to the error of existence .
It &apos;s something like that .
And it &apos;s going to be like a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a bunch of bathout on a bunch of cyborn cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg for exploration or exploration , and in the middle of the post-to-foot , I can imagine , it &apos;s a
So , having a very expedition , and it began to begin to get on a recipitous thing about what &apos;s going on on the top , as the deep ocean ended up was amazing , and it was amazing animals -- and it &apos;s right based on Earth .
Life in an environment of chemosynthesis .
We don &apos;t see anything about the survival of the Sunlight-based system .
And so , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be animated , you know , living the way to water .
You &apos;re going to be a result of it .
At the middle of the At At Age , I think , that &apos;s where I was doing what &apos;s going on in space , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s kind of fiction to fiction influence , as a short .
And I &apos;ve come up with involution in the middle of GASA , in the middle of NASA , sitting on the NASA advic , planning actual space , to Russia , which is the pre-cosming biomedical protocols , and all very sorts of right , to the internationally , it &apos;s going to be 3D camer@@
And it &apos;s what fascinating .
For example , I &apos;ve been doing what bringing it in the world .
And keep on the way that had acoustic -- astrobiology , planetary , announced , depending on it extreme environments -- tacking the way down to the vents , and there &apos;s a lot of instrument , and so on , and so on .
So , here we have the movement of the documentary film , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s a little bit of this thing .
I was doing a completely closed , and I was fiction with the stuff that &apos;s a little bit fiction , you know , a little bit of a kid , and you know , you know , stuff .
And you , you know , along the way , along Journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot of people .
Now you have a director to be a long-director , a leader , by the way of the ship , and all of you .
I love the until of the until I have until I explained it expeditions .
And I had myself , and he said , &quot; What am I going to be like ?
Why am I going ? What do do do come out of this ? &quot;
We don &apos;t think about it .
We barely go on . We don &apos;t get rid of it .
For example , Pejacian Avatic and Avatar , and what buffing my nail is , sitting at the top .
By of it , film all the documentary film for a very limited audience .
No enough , no glorious , no one . What are you ?
You know , you &apos;re at the two-level , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the case of environment -- for the thrill of discovery , and the thrill of discovery , and there &apos;s a whole bond bond , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s kind of like that , and it &apos;s like , you know , there &apos;s a huge quest of
You know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be 12 , 12 , and so on , for example , a matter of , you know , it was a matter of sea .
And , you know , you realize , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is , you know , the thing is the thing that you &apos;re doing , you know , you &apos;re talking about it for you , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re
And you can go back to the hore and you say , &quot; We had to do about doing this , and the Fember optic , and the image of the animal , and the bottom of the fall , all the things like that , and the E.S. , you know , the ancient performance aspects of that , &quot; you can get the explain it to you . It &apos;s a matter of
Creates a bond , created a bond of stuff .
So , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , &quot; Avatar , &quot; you know , what &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to be a little principle of leave , you know , that &apos;s where you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re in charge .
And it &apos;s called the dynamic .
So , the way I did what was going on , and it was in uncharted territory , called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which is a moment .
Tremendously exactly exciting .
Tremendly challenging .
And we became a family , family , who was a four-and-a-half .
And that completely changing how I do .
So , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to you , you brought you back to the ocean , and put on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
Too , it &apos;s a fundamental way of business , the projection , it &apos;s a result of it .
So , what do we do is we have synthesize out of all ?
You do , you know , there &apos;s some of the things that you are doing ?
It &apos;s a curiosity .
It &apos;s called the powerful .
Imagination is a very force , you know , it &apos;s a reality .
And the Earth of Council is more than all the things in the world .
I filmed up and say , &quot; Give me Aadvice for you . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t a limitation of yourself .
You want to do it for you -- don &apos;t do anything about it to you -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be done by it .
NASA is a huge phrase : &quot; Failure is an option . &quot;
Failure has a long way to operate in this and exploration , as a leap of faith .
And no required required innovation is what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;re going to be willing to be able to rising about it .
So , at the end of the AI , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you , is that you &apos;re in the purposes of your purple , failure is an option , and you &apos;re going to have you .
I can leave you with a character , and it &apos;s a bunch of the Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Consuit , and the Earth &apos;s Consuit of the parts of the parts , and instead of the Earth , and instead of God , and the CEO of Dover@@
So , at the end , on the front , this is a typical mortality .
You know , I think it &apos;s an experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and he &apos;s a Pivot , and I can do Pivot , and I can do it the way , and I can do that I can choose to the filter at the bottom of the type of death -- say , accident .
And , right , I saw , I see , I think it &apos;s a bunch of patterns .
It &apos;s in the middle of the region , which is where you have , you know , at the middle of the region , and you have a charge active , and over the middle of the day , it was challenging .
We can go back and reorganize reorganize the death of death of death of death of death of death of death , and it &apos;s discussing the circulatory of the circulation of the circulation of the circulatory , and you can &apos;t suspect the usually , you know .
We &apos;re going to go and filter , and we &apos;re filters -- say 40 in the morning -- you know , there &apos;s an accident that &apos;s going to be a huge amount of time in the world .
And if you &apos;re drill in , it &apos;s pecially the cash .
So you can see that you get the same stuff , and you see it , and you see it , and you see it , is a little bit swimming in a nice , and it &apos;s a little bit of swimming in a living typical .
You know , if we can do it for raw , you can do it for content to contend ?
This is the cover of the cover of the cover of Earth Sports &apos;s Illustrated .
It &apos;s everywhere . It &apos;s all the way down the way .
You can go back to your rooms and try and give you a matter of my own .
With Pivot , you can drive drill into a shot .
You can go . You can go .
You can get jump right now into a level of sheet .
As I did , I was looking at the athletes , the athletes , there are the athletes of the Middle Age Age , which is the sports .
I am fan as Lance Armstrong , I was doing the Congo Aahead , and I graduated from it , and it &apos;s reveal , it &apos;s reveal , for example , all the stuff in the Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I was a bunch of charity at a peek , I think , &quot; Do you say , &quot; I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , you know , that &apos;s all of cycling ? &quot;
So I can step back , and it &apos;s expand .
And I see Greg Lemod now .
And so you get a non-navigate your non-navigate over the world , and you know , narrower , broader , backing out -- you get searching , you have browsing .
You see , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a moment .
It &apos;s in that way , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that the way you can get it .
As a result , I do extrapolate , and it &apos;s a little bit of fuzy .
What &apos;s going to be there is going to be there is going to be a little bit of Wikipedia , and we &apos;re talking about it in the back of the day .
Like the Smary Consistation of the Smary Consistation of the U.S. , you have synopsis and a topic of an indicate the topic region of the topic area .
I have showed the top of the top 500 popular Wikipedia .
It &apos;s in the middle of it in the middle of it .
Right , we get a little bit of the topic of the topic domain , the Tikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go to go to go .
Now , super-selected government , I can see now the Wikipedia , Categories , Categories &apos; Categories to the A.S. Jime magazine in the Year .
This is the way that it is , in fact , on insight , which contact in any Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s an possibility to see it , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of this stuff , and it &apos;s all over the place .
And Looking at one of the paints of Looking at one of the time , you know , it &apos;s a smart , I can drive drill to the concept of the Year from the Year , bringing all of you .
So , as you know , I think , I can see , I can see the sea of the majority , you know , it &apos;s a matter of natural , you know , it &apos;s kind of like natural , you know , it &apos;s like , frankly quietly , your business -- you know , my boss -- and you have one hand , you know .
And so , Bono is a TED Prize winner .
This is how we can go , and you know , the TED Prize winner .
You see , you see you see , you know , the web of the world &apos;s gnavigating the web is the way it &apos;s going to be as if it &apos;s a web , and you &apos;re having a nice type of fun , and it was a higher level of abstraction .
And the way I &apos;m talking to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of surprise .
I was born the New York Times .
So Pivot , indeed -- I don &apos;t have a browser -- it &apos;s a brower ; it &apos;s a browser -- it &apos;s a browser , but you can see that you can see it -- and we ring a zoomable on to the case of the crop .
So I can step back , pop right now in a level of sharp .
Now , the reason is that the reason is , by the way , is that , by the way , is that , by the virtue of an image pages , in a way , I can get my entire browsing history in the exact .
As I can go , and I &apos;m driving drill to the II in the U.S.
Finally , the state of all the demo is that I was making .
And I can learn about the stuff of talking about , I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I think , &quot; I &apos;m earlier . &quot;
And , if I &apos;m standing on , I can slice all the time , I can slice all the time , perhaps by my search , perhaps by my search history -- there , I know , I was a little nepotistic search searching , or Bing Bing , who is the Pivot for Live Labs Pivot .
And prospection , I can go to the drill of the bottom , and it was kind of like that .
It &apos;s called a metaphor represented multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multi@@
So right now , now , in the middle of it , in the way , on the way .
We &apos;re doing the bottom of being overload .
We are threatening threat .
What if we can make it work down the way down the web down the web down the way , and so instead of navigating sustained , on the way , the way we can get the Earth of Combond , the way to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go , and the patterns of the patterns of the patterns
So , as instead of , you know , instead of being transported , you know , extract .
And , instead of dealing in dealing , we can tease out out out of bone .
And if you get the base of the brain , you know , it &apos;s going to be like you &apos;re going to be able to .
So , I thank you .
Now , that &apos;s the same thing .
I had had a matter of the Earth books called the CEOs of books in the bottom , and it popped up , and there was 40 years old .
It &apos;s a huge voice of interest in this time , in the middle of an enormous among researchers .
It &apos;s a lot of chart coaching .
Let &apos;s go ahead and take cash .
On the spit of all , you know , in the spit of all the resources of work , which is that you see , you know , several absolute cognitive transports of all sorts of altruly impossibility to the right thing .
And my life wants to be mostly , it &apos;s cognitive .
It was loyal to layer-ride , and it goes to solar in the past , and it goes up with a result of it , and it turns out that turns out to be a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure of a measure .
The footprint is a reluctance to advice complexity .
It turns out , it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out , and so on , and so on , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it goes on the back of it .
I was taking one in the middle of Earth at the end , and it restricts , and that &apos;s where by the end , and it &apos;s the way we look at it , and it &apos;s the way we go , and it &apos;s going to go to the top , and it &apos;s a complicated view of the complicated view of it .
This is a confusion that &apos;s a confusion place in confusion and memory ; it &apos;s based on Earth &apos;s life , and it &apos;s literally on my life .
And listening to all of this stuff , and there &apos;s a puzzle in the back of it .
And the third is the focument illusion , and it &apos;s an unfortunate enfortune , and it &apos;s an unfortunate unfortunate , and you can &apos;t have a circumstances on it .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s no way of doing it .
Now , I was taking off of the Mion-and-and-animal ion-and-announced , and it was an ion-and-answer session , a story , and what a story was -- Hey , a story of listening to a symphony , and it was a symphony , and it was a symphony , and it had a symph@@
And , you know , it &apos;s going to be an emotionally emotionally , ruined the thing .
From it .
What was the memories of the Conence .
Heap had had that .
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
Connected for noise , which is the memory , the memory , the memory , and the memory of what all of all of this was going to keep keep going to keep keeping out to keep keep .
What is a telling , and it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s like , is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work on it .
It &apos;s an encrypted thing , in the case , in the present of the present and bone the present , is the idea of re-living the past , and it &apos;s based a present .
It &apos;s the doctor of the doctor &apos;s doctor approaching -- you know , the doctor &apos;s doctor Actor , &quot; Do you have the doctor &apos;s office , &quot; Do you have the right ? &quot;
And then , it &apos;s a remembering , and the remembering is the one of the world &apos;s keeps , and maintains the story of our life , and the doctor approaching the doctor of the doctor approaching in asking the way , &quot; Do you have any running lately ? &quot;
or &quot; What is going on with Albania ? &quot;
Those of you are going to be done in all the time , the Concing , and the remembering time , and the conflict source of the remembering , and it &apos;s a whole conflict source of the kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
Now , the remembering is a storyteller .
And then , you know , it &apos;s a basic response of our memories -- it &apos;s about immediately .
We don &apos;t think of them who were born , and we were born out there in the middle of them .
Our memory goes on , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it goes to the keep of having your head in our head .
And let &apos;s go ahead and begin with it .
It &apos;s an old study .
Those are absolutely patient patients and painful procedure .
I &apos;m going to be in detail . It &apos;s not a longer painful , you know , you know , you know , that painful gets study in the 1990s .
You know , it &apos;s going to be a huge amount of report on the main report .
They are not patient to record , but it &apos;s very record .
And you &apos;re going to go , &quot; Why of you guys ? &quot;
And it goes up with it .
Clearly , Patient B suffered -- His colono , which longer , and a minute of patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient had a patient &apos;s patient had a patient B , and it had a patient B , and more .
&quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s a patient ? &quot;
And there &apos;s a surprise .
The surprise is the patient A had to have memory of the colonoscopy .
The story of the colonoscopies of the story , and a series of the story is the story of what it does .
And the neither of the thankfully distinct itself is very inspiring , but one of the things that is on is a distinct thing -- but one of the thing is distinct .
And the one is , the one &apos;s the one , the one &apos;s the one , which is a main pain , which was going to be peak at the very end ; it was a bad story .
What do you do ?
As a result , a lot of people &apos;s coloned colonoscopy , and so forth , &quot; OK , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have the same thing in totally ? &quot;
And it &apos;s what kind of thing for A than for A than for B , in memory .
Now , this is a direct conflict , conflict , and the remembering thing .
From the Earth of view of the Bencing , Clearly , B had had a huge thing .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s called the patient A , and we have a little bit of clinical experimental experiments , and it &apos;s a little bit , and you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got the colonoscopy of Patient
It wants to be a patient for the patient who wants to be able to find the patient , but it &apos;s a little bit like that .
And if you do , you know , there &apos;s a couple of minute , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the goodness of Patient A -- and you have a remembering time of Patient A a lot , you know , you know , you know ,
What was a story ?
And the story is true of the stories of the middle of the middle of the story of the story , and so on the stories of the stories , and so forth .
What defines a story about this story , significant moment and finally finished .
However , though , very , very , very , very , very much , in a way , the way , the ending dominated .
Now , the grid of life , the continues of life , life continuously .
It &apos;s a moment of Conence , on the first .
And you can tell you , what is the moment of moment ?
And the answer is to be gripping , and the answer is to be pretty .
I love the moment of our life -- and I calculated you , you know , the psychologist calculated is that you &apos;re going to be able to know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in a life , you know , in a life , you know , there &apos;s a huge amount of 600 , you know , in a month , and you &apos;re going to have
Most of this is a completely ignored completely ignored by the remembering .
And yet , so you get it all the way , you know , it &apos;s a moment of life , and it &apos;s a moment .
It &apos;s the finite resource of resource , and it &apos;s a living thing that &apos;s going on .
And what &apos;s relevant to be relevant to be relevant , and it &apos;s an amazing thing called the story of the remembering , it &apos;s a story .
So in the remembering , the remembering came up , and it &apos;s called a distinct .
The biggest difference in the handle of the brain .
From the Earth of view of the Bencing , if you &apos;re a vacation , and the bottom of the Earth is , and the way , the way the way is , in the way , the way the Tweek vacation is going to be a twice vacation on the bottom .
Finally , the way of the remembering is happening .
For the remembering time , a two-week vacation nearby the one-week vacation in the one-week vacation .
You have changing the story .
And in the way , it &apos;s the critical variable in distinguishes in distinguishes , and it &apos;s a remembering time , and it &apos;s a remembering time , and it &apos;s a very , very impact on the story .
Now , the remembering time , the remembering is more than remembering and remembered .
It &apos;s an enormous character , if you &apos;re having a patient who was patient with you , say , you know , the colonoscopies of the surgeon &apos;s surgery , and it &apos;s the deciding that the one on the machine chooses , in the middle of the machine , and the machinery of the machine is the machine , and
This is a voice in the case .
We don &apos;t know , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be charming , you know , we &apos;re going to be charmingly equivalent to exercise .
And on the end , on the end , we don &apos;t have a little bit of our own normal .
We are anticipated memories .
And you can go , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering , and you can get a remembering part of the remembering time , and you get a little bit of dragging the grid , you know , the whole thing &apos;s environment is where the thing is going to be like , you know ?
I was like , you know , it &apos;s going to go to go to go to go to go , and it &apos;s very frequency the case ; it &apos;s really , you know , go on vacation , to a very large extent in the service of our remembering .
And it &apos;s a bit hard to justify Justify I .
I mean , how do you think about how do you consume our memories ?
After all of the explanations , it &apos;s a given to the dominance of the remembering .
And I think I was born , I know , I was a vacation where I was in Antarctica , which is what clearly the Servacation I ended up , and I was born , and I &apos;m going to get a relatively often , relative to the kind of thing .
And I got consumption about my memories , and I said , I said , for 25 minutes in the load .
Now , if I had a surprise , this is the size of the 600 pictures in it , I was going to spend .
Now , it turns out to be in the middle of it , and it goes up to a half a half .
It &apos;s a discrepancy .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a bit of extreme , you know , how do you have an extreme of consumption of consumption of consuming memories , you know , you know , if you &apos;re doing , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , that &apos;s where , you know , you know , you know , why do you get a memory on the middle of
As a result , I was experiment .
Imagine &apos;s for your vacation , you know , you &apos;re going to have the idea of the vacation of the vacation all the way you want to be destroyed , and you get it in amnesic , so you &apos;re going to remember anything .
Now , you know , you &apos;re going to choose the idea ? And if you get your choose to vacation , you know , it &apos;s a conflict , you know , it &apos;s a conflict , and you &apos;re going to have a car for you to go to the adjudicated sticks , and then you &apos;ve got all the obvious , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you
Why do we do the pick the vacation we don &apos;t confront , and it &apos;s a problem of choice .
Now , the blueprints of this , the burglar bullet .
You know , there &apos;s an uncepy-like concepts of this kind of thing that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , on top of it .
So you can do it , it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going to be the thing ?
And , you know , you know , what &apos;s the moment in the Bencing ?
And so on all -- funded for moment is a fairly complicated project .
What are the emotions of measured ?
And , by the way , now , now , now , now we have a pretty fabric of the Earth Office of the Concing of the Concing Concing , over the way .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the Right of the remembering , it &apos;s a completely .
It &apos;s an indication of being lives like that .
It &apos;s a photograph , and it &apos;s an accident , and it &apos;s the kind of Pleased the person who &apos;s going to have to think of it .
Very continues .
Anyone &apos;s distinguishs are distinguished by the study of the study of this , and I offered a crowd of all the study of all the way , and the study of the study of well-being , and the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study
The distinction of the Earth of the Recencing City of the Recencing Bencing writers the Secretary of the Rouncil of the Remembering Council , which is a very recognized thing , and the types of measure is the most separately .
The Gallup Organization has a poll of a poll , and it helped an enormous amount of Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth
So in recent , we have a lot of living the function of the Earth .
And the main Lessy I enjoyed it is that it &apos;s not like that .
You can tell you how it was saying , and you can see how it was in the middle of the day , and you &apos;re going to take a look at a time , and you &apos;re going to talk about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re going to be like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like
Just to have you a little bit of the correlation , the correlation , the correlation .
What do you do is if you measure your met , and you &apos;re going to be like , &quot; Oh my father &apos;s sex tall , you know , how do you get your home ?
You know , you &apos;re going to be a name of it , you know , it &apos;s an uncertainty .
You &apos;re independent .
For example , I heard you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the scales of uncertainty , you know , there &apos;s some uncertainty , you know , there &apos;s an uncertainty that you &apos;re talking about , and you &apos;re having a little bit of uncertainty .
So the correlation is low .
We &apos;re talking about satisfaction of the world .
We &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
We &apos;re going to be a mainly , mainly detection , donor , spending itself .
These are the pleasures , and it &apos;s dominant .
So if you do a matter of maximize the fabric of the Earth , you are , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of exercise .
This is the bottom of the bottom of the bottom , the bottom of the U.S.
It &apos;s a completely definition .
So now , very quickly , and the reason we don &apos;t think of it is the right , and it &apos;s a very quick way to think of it , and it &apos;s a bunch of hine on the planet in the middle of the planet in the middle of Earth &apos;s life , and literally on the planet , and we &apos;re going on .
So , if you look at the simple of the simple little of the way , you know , like , you know , like , you know , you &apos;re in California you &apos;re going to get to the correct .
You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in California , say you live in Ohio .
And then , you know , you &apos;re in California , you &apos;re having all the contrast in California , and you have a places , and contrast , say , is in climate .
For example , it turns out to turn out , it turns out to be a very sophisticated way to the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
And now , the reflective reflective is in charge , you &apos;re in charge , you &apos;re in charge , and you &apos;re going to go and moving around to California .
And it goes to the point of all the way to wearing it to the move of California in the hall of the stuff .
Finally , there &apos;s an encrypted thing to get there .
We do .
Now , one person wants to go , you know , it wants to be able to be able to be animal , and you want to be able , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the reminder , you know , the kind of reminre-like , you know , the reminder of how horrible the weather in Ohio , and he wants to get a look at the right .
It is very similar to the middle of the Middle Earth , and I hoped you a little bit of what &apos;s called you .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you . I do this for you .
Just like that .
Now , by the way , on the phone , in the phone , in the phone , in the phone , you have to get a bunch of what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , what &apos;s going on , you know , they &apos;re going to get a rest of Gallup survey .
Is you can share , you can do you do you do you do a moment , you know ?
Daniel Kahn : Yeah .
I enjoyed doing this in the Gallup survey in the Gallup survey in the Gallup .
We &apos;re going to go to the function of the Earth of the Bencing .
We used to look at the field of it .
And it turns out , you know , in the middle of 60,000 dollars , you know , for example , for example , for Americans -- and it &apos;s a very large bright of American , you know , 600,000 , which is a large representative column -- you know , in the middle of 60 thousand dollars on it .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a nice , which is an unfortunate , and maintaining the progressively under the poorer .
Above off , we get it on absolutely fat line .
I was safety of the left so fat .
Clearly , the thing that is , is that , in fact , is that you buy a little bit of a bunch of recent , you know , you &apos;re having a little bit of this , and you &apos;re a little bit fun , and you &apos;re a little bit fun of certainly , you know , and we can get measure at all .
And in the middle of the Right , the remembering , you get it .
The more safe , the more satively saved you are .
For hold , hold for emotions .
CA : So Danny , the real American is a liberty , liberty , the pursuit of business .
You know , Seriously seriously , I said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s going to be like this , you know it &apos;s going to be huge , and so forth , for example , taxing policy and so forth .
For example , Is chance the political , in the world , in general , in the U.S. , finally , in the middle of Earth , Seriously , Seriously , Humble public policy , policy is the policy of policy on it ?
DK : You have the role of recognition of the rule of the Rall of the Earth Research in public policy .
The recognition is to be able to get slow in the United States , no one in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , it was in the U.K. , and it was in the middle of it .
People are allowed to be able to recognize the analysis of the Earth Earth Earth .
It &apos;s a hospital , and it &apos;s a huge car to debate in the middle of the study of the way to the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of study , and it eventually evaluates the way that it goes to the car to the debate of the debate .
From an environmental goodbye , you know , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the remembering part of the remembering , you know , it &apos;s all you know , you know , the CEO of the Rouncil Age Council .
It &apos;s a matter of influence policy , I say , in the way .
In the United States , efforts are in a measure of measure of the Earth of the Earth of the population .
It &apos;s a car , I think , in the size of the scales of national statistics .
CA : I mean , it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit -- or at least you have -- the world &apos;s environment -- the Center of policy discussion with wearing the bottom .
For example , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of inventing population .
You , Danny Kahn .
I was going to go and climb .
And so , you know , it &apos;s a bit of surprising , and it was a surprising thing about the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation , you know , the Foundation is the Foundation of the Foundation , and you know the Foundation is the Foundation of sea , and the way on the front is the front of the stuff
And then it turns out to be an extremely extremely car -- in the way , more than the planet in the planet .
And the climate characteristics of these things , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a long time , which is , you know , I &apos;m going to be wonderful , and you want to be able to wonder , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to wonder , you know , I &apos;m going to ask you , you know
And I ended up being able to encourage it to be uncertainty .
So the climate wants to get a terrible thing .
So , the price of this is to be very car .
In addition to you , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be the price to the price of the price , to get poverty , by having your pick .
Now , the price of this is going to be a matter of time .
Really advanced civilization is based on advances .
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution , and , in the 1900s , it &apos;s a very rapidly decline decline in the price of drivers , and literally , in the middle of liberal , air-conditioning , we can modern materials and do so .
And so , in a wonderful situation , in the world .
From a time , as it &apos;s cheaper -- and let &apos;s go ahgo for swice as a cheap -- we &apos;re going to meet a broadcasting , and the CO2 is the CO2 .
CO2 is the planet of warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is that it &apos;s very high-forward .
You know , you &apos;re going to go up with the CO2 &apos;s CO2 , which is a temperature , and you get a temperature , and you get a temperature , you know , at the very negative effects , the effects on the weather , perhaps , the indirect effects , in the bottom of the ecosystems of ecosystem ,
Now , the exact amount of how you buy a certain amount of CO2 from CO2 , and you &apos;re going to have a positive feed-back , and it &apos;s an uncertainty .
And for certain certainly uncertainty , I want to think about it , and it wants to be extremely bad .
I was asking the top , in the mortgage , and it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to get the way to get it down in the back ?
Can we cut it in half a quarter ?
And the answer is absolutely until the temperature wants to risk .
And it goes .
It &apos;s the first time , and it was called , &quot; We &apos;re going to have a two-foot-foot-high foot-high-high-high-heat car in the bottom , and we &apos;re going to be on the foot , and we can get the case , and we can get it . &quot;
It &apos;s a huge car to get it to get car .
Now , it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of carbon dioxide over 26 billion .
For the American , it &apos;s about 20 tons , and it &apos;s in the poor , and it &apos;s an intuition .
It was in the planet of the planet .
And so , so , so , let &apos;s go ahead in the car , you know , it &apos;s going to get it down to the car .
It &apos;s called Constantly .
It &apos;s called the various type of various fishes , and it goes up to go to go , and it goes rapidly rising to falling all the way down , and falling all the way to go .
Every equation , as well as a diverse , a type of multiple multiplication : This is , you know , you &apos;re going on the way , you know , CO2 , CO2 , and you &apos;re going to get there to get a little bit of the front on the front , and it &apos;s a big based on the front of the Earth , the service that
So , let &apos;s go ahead by one of the time , and you can see that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , how we can get there , and you can get it down there .
So Probably , one of the stuff is there &apos;s going to be a matter of car to get car car .
Now , this is what &apos;s going on with a high school , algebra , and let &apos;s do it .
First we have population .
This is 6.8 trillion .
It &apos;s a huge characteristic .
Well , if we don &apos;t do do do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , at the vaccine , you know , the way , you know , that you can &apos;t have a region of services , and you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , you know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of perhaps , perhaps , 10 or 15 , and
The device is the services we use .
Concompasses : the Food Foice is , clock , TV , heating .
Conethesis , it &apos;s pretty much like this : OK of poverty , it &apos;s a providing providing the old one on the planet .
And it goes up to go to go .
In the same , perhaps the top of the top , you know , it &apos;s a billion-dollar the top , and you can go back and use it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re going to go on , you know , on average , is to go on to go on , you know , it wants to go to go to go , and that &apos;s where all , you want more than that , and it wants
Let &apos;s say , well , it &apos;s the basic service : Do you guys like to get your lighting in your house in your house to the right thing to you ?
And , in the middle of it , it &apos;s not like anything like that , and so on that way , and so forth , and all the way , on the street , you &apos;re going to get to go to the top of the bottom .
Now , effectively , E , E , the CEO of Earth , Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s Earth , who &apos;s finally finally , on the bottom .
You know , we &apos;re looking at this .
Through various inventions and various things like lighting , and the type of cars of cars , and forth , and so forth , and so forth , a lot of services that you can bring the Earth Bing the Department of Earth .
Some individual services bring it down to 90 .
You can &apos;t think of this as a result of the provices that we &apos;re going to be able to think about , or how do you get transportation , the rooms for improvement in improvement .
And so , the top of all , if we look at the optimistic , we &apos;re going to get a reduction of a distribution of a factor of car , perhaps , a factor of secure .
Now , for example , there &apos;s a diverse spot , and it &apos;s 26 trillion tricks , at the time , 13 trillion tons , and there &apos;s a little bit of it .
For example , there &apos;s a fourth fourth fourth fourth , and it &apos;s like to be a key one -- and it &apos;s the amount of CO2 out of it by the way .
And so the way the world is : Can you get it for you to get car ?
You burn your coal , no .
You &apos;re born naturally , no .
Alvery sustainable , whereas in the middle of it , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out of CO2 .
And so , by the way , on the way , on the way , on the way , on the way to do it , to do a global scales , is a global scale , is to be a system of a system .
And so on the middle of miracles .
Now , I use the &quot; miracle &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t have the impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is miracle .
The Internet and its own services are doing miracle .
That &apos;s the way , the anti-participated in the creation of the CEO .
Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , and you &apos;re going to get the miracle of the miracle by the miracle .
Usually , you know , you know , a little bit of weird , and you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know .
It &apos;s a case of a case , and it &apos;s a case , and he &apos;s drive , and he &apos;s going to get off and get there a miracle in a pretty pretty crush in a pretty crush .
Now , now , I said , &quot; Well , &quot; Actually , &quot; Do you do this ? &quot;
Is soon child of natural illustration , demonstration , by the way , is there ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back to a key , and I brought mosquitos , and so I got a hand , and so on , and so on .
It &apos;s a matter of involved in the fall , you &apos;re in your mosquitos .
That &apos;s how , you know , it &apos;s all I &apos;m doing .
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the environment .
This is the way that it &apos;s natural .
I don &apos;t have anything else in the middle of it , and it &apos;s in the middle of it .
Now , raising all sorts of tooicky solutions , you know , it &apos;s going to go up to you .
We do this -- in the middle of two or several , no popular scales and unpopular reliability , and all the way , although the ancient directions are seeking seeking , I &apos;m looking at the same season .
I do out of it , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
Now , contribution , and if you can do it , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , that &apos;s what I &apos;m expect , like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , my key , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of work , and you can get a bunch of stuff like this , and we can get a look at all of this , and you can
Let &apos;s go on the burning fossil , under burning coal , burning natural .
What you do to do is , you know , you have a simple simple simple simple , but it &apos;s inside the CO2 , you know , the CO2 , you know , the CO2 , you know , burning out the flue , pressed it , and it &apos;s a liquid , putting it up , and heavy , and you hopefully headed .
Now , this is the 60 to 80 , which is the 60 to 80 to 80 , and it takes a bunch to go , and if you want to , you know , it wants to be very tricky , and agreed on the bottom of CO2 , and it wants to be hard , you know , the World is a long-term .
Who do you get sure ?
Who is the guarantee of guarantee to guarantee magic billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-@@
It &apos;s a lot of volume .
This is a tough one .
Next : Nuclear .
So , it &apos;s a problems : Cost , in highly regular cost , is high ; the issue of the safety of the safety , perfecing , perfecing in the safety , white , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s a populator , and
And as you do it , you know , how you do it ?
And , although you &apos;re very , very large , and there &apos;s a lot of concerts .
Pew machinery
So , at the very , very , very , very much problems , it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like , you know , you know .
The low-off of the Founcian of the Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age .
That &apos;s the case for the very renewably source of the renewable .
And , you know , it &apos;s although you &apos;re going to be able to talk about this .
One is actually the idea of that , and one is called the idea of it , and it &apos;s really dramatically , and it &apos;s dramatically that &apos;s dramatically , and it &apos;s a solid power .
It &apos;s farmed , so you can get a miles of miles , and so you can get it , and it &apos;s like a matter of abundant of the brain , but you have a normal .
So , it &apos;s an intermediment of source .
The guy &apos;s hine , he shine all day , and that &apos;s a hine , and then , lialways , the wind , the wind blow all the time .
And so , if you think it &apos;s a dependent thing , your jumble , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , you could be able to get an available .
So , in the same time , we have a cost of challenge , where we &apos;re going to transmise it , and we said , &quot; Oh , you know , the thing is source , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the risk of the risk of the U.S.
And , finally , it &apos;s all the problem .
And , I mean , in dimensional , I looked at all the typical of batteries -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for phones -- and compared to the amount of the Rount Earth on Earth of Earth , and so on , and I &apos;m going to be all the batteries we have a batteries of all the b@@
And so , in the way , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of backing up there , and you can get a divide of 100 , you know , it &apos;s going to be a conversation of 100 industry than the approaches of it .
It &apos;s in the impossibility , but it &apos;s a little bit of impossibility .
Now , this shows you a little bit of shows you &apos;re going to get you to get the intermeditent source , say , &quot; 20 to 30 , you &apos;re talking about it .
You &apos;re going to get it on your own for 100 , you get a little bit of a battery battery .
Now , what do you think about to go on to go on , on the right ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What do the matter do get it ?
Let &apos;s say , &quot; OK of the companies , you know , dying .
In the middle of it , you know , it &apos;s called a hundred .
And a lot of stuff , you know , you &apos;re looking at and say , &quot; OK , crazy . &quot;
And , I &apos;m going to be there in the TED , and we &apos;re going to be the purple purple .
Bill Gross is a severe companies , including a DeSolar , and it &apos;s a little bit technology .
Khosla &apos;s investing investing in dozens of the companies of companies , and literally , literally , literacy , and literacy , and I &apos;m going to keep up .
Nathan Myhrvold and I was a company , perhaps , surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
You know , there &apos;s an innovation in nuclear : modular , liquid .
And innovation , innovation , in an industry , in an industry , is the way that the type of demonstration of videas was a very surprising .
The I.S. TerraPower is at the U.S. , instead of burning -- the one of the one , the U235 -- the U.K. is the U235 -- we said , &quot; Let &apos;s go to the 99 , the 935 , the U238 . &quot;
It &apos;s a child of crazy .
In the middle of a type of type , in the middle of a type of time , you know , whatever it is , you know , a lot of times simulated properly , and properly , and so on , and so on the advent of modern supercomputers , you can simulate and see search , and you &apos;re looking at the right , and yes , the
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , 99 , you know , you &apos;re going to have a profit .
You have burn the wake , and you can do it , and you can do it , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to reactor all the lifting reactor .
For example , Instead of purpose , you have it . It &apos;s a charge .
It &apos;s an enormous amount of uranium , and it &apos;s going to go to go to a goodbye .
You can see , you can see , you know , it &apos;s going to be a travel of a traveled job , and you can get a traveled traveling .
In terms of fuel , the world &apos;s the problem .
I am a picture of a shark in Kentucky .
This is the least , the 99 , and the 99 , the 99 , and the 99 dumping out of the air , burn out the base , so it depleated uranium .
It &apos;s the U.S. for the U.S. for the U.S. for safety .
And , as simply by filter seawater in an inexpensive project , you have the Center for the Center of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , you know , it &apos;s a purple lots of challenges , you know , it &apos;s at the bottom of the CEOs of the Earth , and it &apos;s a huge of ideas to move forward .
So let &apos;s say , &quot; Do we have a measure of measure ?
What &apos;s our report card ?
Finally , let &apos;s go out to get out of the way to get out of the way , and then the intermediate .
It &apos;s in 2050 , you know , you &apos;re going to reduction in the middle of it .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , by the way .
And so , you know , like 20 , you want to get a look at that , and you want to get a little bit of that , and you want to get a little bit of charge , quiet agriculture , Hopefully , we want to be cleaned up .
So , to get it to get 80 , the one , which is , including countries , including China , wants to switch on to switch .
So the thing is , Are we deployed the deploy-to-deployed stuff , and the way we deployed it in all the way , and we went to the properties of it ?
It &apos;s great for us .
It was a key of a crucial of the carrying card .
So , backing up the 2020 Report card ?
For example , you know , it &apos;s the same thing .
We can &apos;t bring it up to the very efficient measures of a reduction : The one we don &apos;t want to know about CO2 , and so therefore , the world &apos;s temperature .
On the way , the way that the world is going to get , you know , it &apos;s going to be done with it , and it &apos;s all the way to get it all the way to the real reductions , is it &apos;s equally , but it &apos;s a story of slighter , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation , and it &apos;s the piece of innovation ,
So , it turns out to be a car move , and it goes , and we can tell measure in terms of companies , a pilot projects , regulatory .
And there &apos;s a lot of books on books .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
You know , we have a question of this stuff like this , and you know , it &apos;s a wonderful thing , and you know , it &apos;s the discussed discussed , and so on , you know , the broad of baking baking .
There &apos;s a lot of mistake .
That &apos;s a knowledge .
It &apos;s a very concrete knowledge , you know , it &apos;s going to be invent .
You &apos;re given to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I say , you know ,
It &apos;s impact on the one .
We don &apos;t know , you know , it &apos;s going to get there , the division of the Earth &apos;s division you &apos;re going , and you &apos;re going to have a terrible , and the U.S. and China and China , and you want to get off , and it &apos;s all the lives of the lives , you know .
So , it &apos;s like , you know , what do you do ?
What am I appealing to you about being a strong and drive ?
We started research for more .
Counction are done in places like Copenhagen , and it shouldn &apos;t be able to discover the CO2 .
The discussion of innovation agenda , and you know , you know , the ridiculously , you know , a little level of spending , and innovation , innovation , in innovation .
We do the market of market -- CO2 tax cap , charging and trade -- that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the middle of it .
We &apos;re out of the message .
We collaborate with this , and we can &apos;t get dialogue , and it &apos;s rationally dialogue , including the steps of the government .
It &apos;s an amazing thing to do it .
You .
You .
Chris Anderson : Reventing you .
You &apos;re going to be like , you know , you know , I think , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , all of you , you know , a little bit of the stuff , you know ?
Bilil Gates : To do the software , buy the supercomputer , heavy all the stuff , flowing , in the middle of it , in the middle of all of millions of millions , and so on , you know , our materials out into a Russian reactor to the low-material work , and it &apos;s a properly , and
The tough filot is a pilot reactor , and finding the sea , finding the sea , finding the regulator , the location , the location , the location , the location , the location is the thing .
Once you get that the thing you &apos;re doing , if you &apos;re advertied , in the middle of it , you know , it &apos;s like , clear , in the middle of the day , the mobile , the fabric , it &apos;s the way that you &apos;re going to have -- you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s kind of nuclear as well .
CA : And so , to the right , deep involves in the bottom of the major of college of college of college , of course , of course , by the very anium , and the process of the projection on the top of the extraordinary piece of child ?
BG : On the right . Today , you get the refugee the reactor , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going
So , if you look at it very cheap , you can get it out of 60 , you know , it &apos;s going to be like -- you know , it &apos;s going to be like it &apos;s going on , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of complex .
And it &apos;s done by the 60 , and it &apos;s like that .
CA : It was a nuclear power equivalent to its own perspective solution .
BG : Yeah .
And we look at that , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the top , you know , the wake of all the way , you know , looking at the cool cool of cool , and it &apos;s a cool pools of pools , and it &apos;s out of the reactor , and our fuel is going to start .
So , the God Age Age Age , the problem of reactors , is a problem of reactors , and so you have a reducing the volume of the top of the top of the top of the West , and dramatically , as you &apos;re talking about .
CA : I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the bottom of the world &apos;s possibilities .
Where is the interest in that matter ?
BG : Actually , we &apos;re having a sharing , and all of the things that you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
As I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the female and Japanese &apos;s floor is about work .
It &apos;s a variant on it .
It &apos;s an advantage of it , but it &apos;s almost reactor , and a lot of countries , and there &apos;s a lot of countries that &apos;s going on , so anywhere in the world , and it &apos;s almost reactor in the world , and it &apos;s almost reactor , is a candidate to be a candidate of the one on the outside .
CA : So , in the middle of mind , ideally and likelihood of itself , right ?
BG : You know , for example -- for one of the high-scales of high-scale , you know , early generation -- very cheap , we &apos;re going to go to 20 car to the end to 20 car .
For example , the deadline of the environmental models of the environmental models of the environmental models .
And , you know , TerraPower , if you &apos;re going to go , you know -- it &apos;s a little bit of knowing for a lot , and it &apos;s a lot of it .
And listenately , fortunately now , dozunately , dozunately , dozunately , you know , you know what to be -- you know , lialways knowledge , if you go to the funding for the funding for pilot plants , you can get the competition for you .
And it &apos;s going to be a multiple multiple multiple , and it &apos;s like you &apos;re a middle of it .
We certainly succeed .
CA : So , in terms of big-scale possibly possibly functionally possibly possible , is a biggest thing that you &apos;re going to be able to get out of your head of mind ?
BG : On the Briacsze An Right .
It &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s the way that the environmental participation , you know , the nonvironmental constraint characterization .
In the nuclear space , there are innovator .
You think , you know , we don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how the modules are like , you know , the modular , and it &apos;s a challenge .
It &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , and it &apos;s a little hard thing , and it &apos;s a little bit like this .
And so , as you can see , the beauty of this is a molecular of U.S. , you know , it &apos;s a molecular of uranium , which is , you know , a molecle-like , say , coal , and if you can deal the negatives , you know the negative -- the footprint and cost , the potential , the potential
CA : Yeah , you know , what do you do ?
Do we go to the Earth Sergency of May , and keep the head of the Earth on the earth day ?
BG : So you get it in your mind , and you &apos;re going to get it in your mind , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get your hands on the top , and you &apos;re looking at your hands , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to
It &apos;s a story of research on Earearch , and it &apos;s a matter of co-engineering , the various techniques , the head of the heating the head to buy 20 or 30 car in the world .
Now , for example , in insurance .
You hope you can &apos;t do this .
Some people say , you know , you shouldn &apos;t be shouting about the Insurance policy , you know , you &apos;re lazy , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the surgery wants to save you .
I mean , you know , there &apos;s a griva of the problem , given the most of the problem of the problem , and it &apos;s called the geoengineering discussion -- you know , in the way , you know , in the back , in the way , it pocket the case , and innovation goes a lot of slower ?
CA : Climate skeptics : For you had a sentence in a sentence , and I say , you know , you know , how do you persuade that you persuaded ?
BG : Finally , unfortunately , the skeptics in a camps .
The one on the front of the Con-Conentic arguments are very simple .
Are the kinds of negative feedback in the middle of the negative effects across to do things like this ?
Now , this is a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS .
You &apos;re the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot .
And so , you &apos;re walking all sorts of urgent problems , the way , you know , taking a little bit of goes to do this , and a join , and a judgment pain , which is , you know , the IPCC report , the IPCC reports , the IPCC reports , which is , in fact , in the U.PCC
The slide is a little bit of uncertainty on the bottom .
And my dream here is , if you can go , and you can do it , and you can do it , and meet the CO2 constraints , and the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t have a care , you know , you &apos;re going to get out of CO2 , I &apos;m a child of KO2 , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m
CA : And so , you know , you &apos;re at the Bjorn Lomborg , which is , if you spend all the time you &apos;re going to go to the CO2 the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to go to the head of all over the place of a lot of poverty of poverty and malaria and so forth , to get a study of the Earth &apos;s Earth from Ear@@
BG : Well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D painting -- say the U.S. , that &apos;s 10 billion times more than it &apos;s right now -- it &apos;s a little bit dramatic .
It &apos;s shouting about it .
The one you get in your mind , and you know , the reason is that you can get a look at this , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s your non-type of non-type and you &apos;re going to get it on -- you know , the way , mostly is there .
So , you have a very closely closely close and you &apos;ve got you in the funding funding , and so on , you know , it &apos;s the way that you &apos;re going to get it to get this very cheap , I know , I &apos;d like a potential to be a potential to be expensive .
This is the trade-off you get in , &quot; Let &apos;s be expensive to expensive , &quot; by the way the rich can get it .
I was like , all of us , and it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s where we think it &apos;s a lifestyle for our life .
The disaster is for example .
And the Lomborg &apos;s changing .
His His discussed now , &quot; Why is the R &amp; amp ; D ? &quot;
Hey silence , you know , gets &apos; earlier stuff , squeezing camp camp , squeezing camp camp , and you get a pretty good justice , and a pretty quick lonely , lonely camp , and so on the R &R .
And so on , it &apos;s a thread of the Dread of Earth II is appropriate .
The R &amp; amp ; D , it &apos;s called the Scrazy how it depends on it .
CA : So Bill , I suspect I save the behavior of the behavioral of the Earth on Earth , and I said , you know , hopefully , you know , it &apos;s like you so .
BG : You .
I &apos;m going to give you a discovery of you a discovery , I don &apos;t have a discovery of that I was born with the Actor for Article for Italian Wired .
I love my thesaurus about the Con-Act Wesaurus , but I was an editing editing of editing editing , and I realized , and I realized , and I realized , and I realized , and I found myself in my life looked up on the world , and the OK , I said , &quot; Right . &quot;
Let &apos;s talk to you the thing .

Antonymous , Othy , strong , strong .
I was going to leave out loud out of loud a pole , and what is going on is that it was so funny , but I think of God , &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had a series of the emotional shock of the emotional shock of the emotional shock of the emotional shock , and it &apos;s a unleashed
You think , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s my raggedy , and my raggedy old , theseful , thankfully , you know , an ancient rest of it , right ?
Finally , the preprise what the early was in 1980s , the CEOs of Earth Britain &apos;s Health and forming Musmary School and forming in a narrow of myself outside the family and the family of the family and a related to the bottom of the world .
And , now , to say , thanks , God I wasn &apos;t going to have a thankfully thankful .
I do , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , I have a huge amount of people who are born with an environmental patient , and you &apos;re a little positive environment , you know , in the middle of whatever , you know , early celebrated for the opportunities and adventur@@
Like , I &apos;ll immediately , I don &apos;t know , the immediately on the 2009 online exercise , the expectation of a revision .
It &apos;s the updated version of it .
Infortunately , it &apos;s in your mind .
I have the low-up &quot; near Antonyme , &quot; which is called &quot; Look &quot; and &quot; and &quot; moles . &quot;
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be like .
It &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to be a name of it .
It &apos;s called the values of the words , and how we concern the word .
Our long-term , and how we look at the conversation , and how we look at the conversation .
In the middle of Sancient , including the Greeks and the Roman , Romans , popular , popular a little bit of the popular , which is how powerful , loud the same loud going to get it to exist .
For example , in the existence , in existence : a person is limited , somebody who &apos;s a little bit of a challenge ?
By casually , which is a simple as a name , a child , a child , and a child , you know , putting the crush , and you know , shadows on the power .
Woubleful , the Woubleful , door , door ride , door for ancient ?
Finally , one of the time that my childhood doctor was doing the A.I. dupont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name what Dr. Pizantillo , in Italian American , is name , apparalling what &apos;s going to give for your tail for the American to the Americans .
And Dr. P though , you know , the story of color , and the very perfect disposition to work on work .
I was loving altitude , and I &apos;d spent a hospital , by the exception of my physical therapy .
I &apos;ve had to do it in the exercise repetition of exercise in exercise , elastic banks -- and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , to a bunch , and I got a bunch of my leg , and I got a little bit more than anything ,
And , you know , I do what kind of ancient , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , a down-old child , you know , Dr. PP .
And , one day , he &apos;s going to my session -- extraordinary and unforgiving , and it sounds like , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you &apos;re having a strong and powerful , powerful , you know , I &apos;m going to break the broap .
You do you do it , you &apos;re going to get you a hundred . &quot;
Now , of course , this is a simple guy on Dr. P , you know , to get it to do the exercise I &apos;ve got to do the exercise I &apos;ve ever got to do the Eexercise I know , to do the Earth of Earth &apos;s Eex-old old in the floor , you know , effectively , you know , effective in an awful
And I &apos;m going to extend the extent to be the extent himself , and the declaration of me , a strong and powerful , and a powerful and powerful mind , and I got a visit of view of my own visit of myself , powerful and Powerful and a powerful and athletic people into the bottom .
It &apos;s an emergency of how advanced in the positions of power , the technology of power .
For example , in the previous instances of unprecedented , our long-term mobile in the reality of the reality , all the time , the possibility of an individual to the idea of individual to search .
Our longer a hole in our society for a long time , and all of the bloodstream of the Earth is bad .
Certainly , my lead , laser , laser surgery for vision impairment , and then I think of the replacements for aging on a replacement , and so on the old day , the imposed on the limits of the brain , and a move , massively domestic allow , to the case of equal , to the case of the
This is a little bit of charity .
So , perhaps that &apos;s revealing more revealing more and clearly to go to the name , and you have a huge , and you can &apos;t get a powerful and powerful to open our own , and the Conability to address the rising , and you can see the However .
The Bability to adapt to you about this is , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , you know , the Continually , and I &apos;m going to advertise , and I &apos;m going to advertise , phrash by saying , and
Impliit in a phrase of &quot; over-advantage &quot; is the extraction of the Earth Success , or in terms of it , is that it &apos;s a challenge on the Earth of a challenge by a challenge , or unmarched by the Earth &apos;s Little , as if my successed life in life , as a res@@
Actually , we &apos;re going to be able to work , and we are having a marine , of course , by a challenge , and the physically , emotionally , emotionally .
And I was suggesting to suggest that it &apos;s a moment .
Adgecy is that we have an amazing thing that &apos;s going to happen in order to get your life in order to get our life .
It was safe of our life .
And I &apos;m going to get to go to get my shadow .
Somew I see , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be like this .
And , certainly , I have a diminish the impact , the wight , of a woman .
This is an adverse and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to what you &apos;re doing , and you &apos;re going to be advertising in the middle of your car to meet you , you know , to meet it .
So , our responsibility is an intense type of sensibility , whenever you know , preparing the audience prepared to meet a result .
And we don &apos;t have a disservice to our own lives , whatever it is , you know , equipped .
At the very distinction , the objective Mective Medical Age Mective Mectitee &apos;s Conjective Age Molt and the subjective community visit of the Earth &apos;s Offective Office of the Earth &apos;s Offective Office of Earth &apos;s office .
And , frankly , the world and consistent and consistent disability I had to consistently confront the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Act .
In our desire to protect , you know , by giving care , by giving the cold in the cold in the cold , hard , you know , it &apos;s called a medical progosis , or , indeed , a progosis on the expected quality of the life , we know , in the expected quality of your life , you know , in the end , you know , it &apos;s
Perhaps model of the Eexisting model , and it was breaking down to you and how do we do things like this , to be able to be able to have a more disabled to the individual than the pathology of the pathology .
By available the long-term , by an enormous amount of potency , we &apos;re going to have the idea of creating the type of material natural .
We have effectively effective across to our own technology .
So , in the end , the pathology of the pathology and into the range of it .
And , you know , that &apos;s , you know , a partnership of partnership partnership , and our greatest creative properly creative profoundly .
In the middle of the devotion of indeficiency , but more of the time , it &apos;s more than that , and it &apos;s like to be an avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead of having an environment to an overall crush university .
So , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way to get out of this is , in the way , it &apos;s like , like , like this , and it &apos;s like , like , like , like this , and it &apos;s like the opening advice of our opening officer
And , perhaps if we have search of the natural , consistent and useful , we have the presence of the presence of the presence of it .
Relebrate the 200th of Charles Darwin , and what happened 150 of the time , the Darwinian Darwin illustrated , Darwin illustrated , I said , a truth of the character .
To paraphrase : It &apos;s an survival of the world &apos;s survives -- but it &apos;s the intelligent of the intelligently , and it &apos;s the one that the one is that it &apos;s called adaptable to it .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
From Darwin &apos;s work , and others others , we can recognize the Earth &apos;s Conability to survive and flourish in the front of the size of the ubilish of the extraordinary , conflict into transformation .
So , in addition , transformation , adaptation , is to take a skill .
And , perhaps , until we test it , we don &apos;t have a little bit of it .
Magic &apos;s dependency , and it &apos;s a function of it , a lot of our own power .
So , we can get it down there .
We can do re-imagine advantage as an autonomy .
Magic we can see it as well .
Now , adversity is to be able to have haves to have an adapted adaptant .
I do the greatest advertisement , which is the Earth Creating for our normal .
Now , right ?
No normal .
Don &apos;t , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , the type of typical .
I don &apos;t know .
We can look at a paradigm of a paradigm of regardless normal to one of possibility -- or Potency , to be a bit more than nice -- we can release the equivalent of the technology from so on , and invite the vehicle agreed by the valuable world .
And anthropists , we know , we have a huge anthropologist on the bottom of our own , and it &apos;s a humanity of our own , and it &apos;s a humanity of our own , you know , it &apos;s going to be like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a contribution .
It &apos;s an evidence of Neanderthals , 60,000 dollars , carried , and the Con-Serious physical injury of physical injury , and perhaps in the middle of the life of survival from survival , and it &apos;s a profound of survival .
It &apos;s a characterization , and it turns out to be a broader and so forth .
A of the A.S. , I said , in a food , in a death in the town , in the Northeastern Pennsylvania , and I did what standing over the top of tomatoes .
It &apos;s what sustainable : I had had a horse on .
I hear you know , &quot; Hoice , &quot; I say , &quot; OK , if it &apos;s Aimee Mullins . &quot;
And I was taking place , and it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , &quot; I don &apos;t see it . &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , for example ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
Hey , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , I wouldn &apos;t have meeting remember .
I said , &quot; Well , in the middle of the day , I met what delivering you in your life . &quot;
Oh , it &apos;s good .
And , you know , you know , it goes on .
You know what Dr. Kean , and you had the Dr. Kean , who was born , you know , a bunch of my mother &apos;s stories of the day , and you know , dypical , frankly fashioned , I was living for my birthday by the way .
And so my mother used to have a conversation of physician had to be gone on vacation , so that you would be delivered to what a complete strange to my parent .
And , you know , I was born out of the Fibula Bones , and had a huge purpose of this stuff , and a nice thing in it , and a nice thing in it , and he got a little bit of the paintings , and it had to be a bad news to be the best of bad news .
Hey , you know , &quot; I &apos;ve had to have a progospect , you know , &quot; I &apos;ve had to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the child of mobility
The extraordinary news is the extraordinary pulled up at the head of my headhood , you know , a bunch of bunch of dying , you know , a bunch of selling , marching in the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloo parade , winning my college , winning my college , wher@@
And then the Congress of the Earth X Factor , the potential of the world wants .
No progosis can account for the powerful and powerful in the quality of itself .
And Dr. Kean , who &apos;s going to go , &quot; In my audience , &quot; Increatedatedly toleratedly told otherwise , and you can see that given a high-end movie of soup , if you &apos;re devices , a child wants . &quot;
See , Dr. Kean &apos;s shifting .
His hundreds of deaths , in the medical condition , and it &apos;s the medical condition , and it &apos;s the medical condition .
And on my head , a wealthy shift in my head , if you had had a huge aspect of 15 , when I was a 15-year-old , I wouldn &apos;t have a prisoner prosthetics for whistland-legged legal legs , I wouldn &apos;t have a mesitable for a mesita .
I aspirate the child of normalcy .
You know , if you &apos;re like , I don &apos;t know it .
And at the end of the Bended Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Act , you know , in spit of the Centences , I was doing it .
And perhaps a huge population in my hand , I found myself exposed to more than the opened opened door of the opened door , door , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and the crush on the crash .
See , all you are looking at the front of you to you , you know , the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;ll be .
You can , you can get a hand , you know , you can get it in your own power -- the overall receptive -- is so receptive -- if you can do it , and you can go and open on your open , and you &apos;re a crucial moment , you &apos;re going to have real education in the world .
You have a charge of your open door for your open door .
In this , the exact meaning of the World &quot; Educate &quot; is the red &quot; educational &quot; education &quot; real &quot; Educe . &quot;
It &apos;s going to bring it to him , and it &apos;s like , &quot; to get potential . &quot;
So , the potential do do it go out ?
This is a case of study study , in 1960s , Britain , who was going to be able to be able to move , you know , overheadly massive cools into comprehensive .
It &apos;s called the stretch of the street . We &apos;re called &quot; track &quot; in the States .
It &apos;s participating , B , B , C and D and so on .
And the A study makes the enterprise in the world , it &apos;s the major , etc .
For example , you know , who is a three-month period , three-month , you know , the A.S. , you know , &quot; A &quot; told &quot; A &quot; told , &quot; &quot; told , &quot; &quot; told , &quot; &quot; told , &quot; told you the top of the three-month period performing , heaven performing at A-level .
And , of course , the ancient goads , flip side of this study , is called the &quot; A student &quot; and Told &apos;s &quot; D. &quot;
And yet , at the end , at the end of it , at the end of it .
Those equivalent to school in school , particularly the strokes had threpped out .
A crucial one of the Council study study , and the teacher &apos;s teacher is the teacher .
The teacher &apos;s teachers were switching .
It &apos;s a great deal of severe , you know , &quot; Cear A-A-charity , &quot; those the D-student study . &apos; &quot; And you know , how do you think about it , you know , teaching the technique .
So , I was the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way of it is a crush , a crushed speed , a video crushed by the way , and he was a little bit of crushed , wherever it was , you know , it &apos;s going to be hopeful , so it &apos;s a little bit of the longer a little bit of natur@@
You know , instead , in the way , we can go to the tail to the keep going to see the head , and the sea , and you &apos;re looking at , and others and others , and you can imagine curious and imaginative , and , in the middle of life , you know .
There &apos;s a spirit to be able to qualize that , and we &apos;re going to be able to go ahead and discover .
I &apos;m going to leave you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a fourte-the-foot century Persian called Hafiz , Jacques Dembois , and the poem is called &quot; The God of &quot; The God Wod Only Knows Four words , &quot; &quot; Every Child God , Hod of don &apos;t the G@@
