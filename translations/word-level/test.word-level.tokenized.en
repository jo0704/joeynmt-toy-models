A few years ago , here at TED , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> called &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
The idea is quite simple . <unk> have to <unk> the <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about <unk> <unk> , about <unk> <unk> and a <unk> .
The <unk> needs to be <unk> up .
And while it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because people <unk> <unk> very quickly .
And so I thought this is an interesting idea , and I put it into a <unk> .
It was a great success .
I &apos;ve done about 70 <unk> in the world , with students , <unk> and <unk> , even with <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task , which <unk> <unk> <unk> into nature &apos;s <unk> , and I want to share some of it with you .
<unk> , most people start <unk> the task .
They talk about it . They talk about what it looks like , it <unk> for power .
And then you spend a little time in <unk> and organization . They <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
They spend a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the <unk> , and they put it on top of the top , <unk> a step back and &quot; <unk> , &quot; she <unk> her work .
But then what happened is , almost always , the &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> <unk> that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s a series of people who have much more <unk> <unk> than others , and under the <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> , they <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they create <unk> <unk> .
And of course , there are <unk> who have much more <unk> <unk> and under the <unk> are <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
As <unk> <unk> , they <unk> not only the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> structures of all .
What they might be asking is , what is this ? Why ? What about those ?
And <unk> said , &quot; <unk> of the children <unk> to be <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
They don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that was that <unk> were <unk> to find a <unk> plan .
And then <unk> him .
What happens when they put the <unk> on the top , they don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
<unk> <unk> , what ?
What <unk> is doing is they start to <unk> and build <unk> , <unk> <unk> , always with the <unk> at the top , so that they have the opportunity to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And with each trial , the kids are going to get <unk> <unk> and not .
So the <unk> of working with <unk> is <unk> , but let &apos;s see how <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> for most <unk> , <unk> , half of them are , <unk> a little more , but not much , <unk> are better than the <unk> .
Who &apos;s the <unk> ?
<unk> and <unk> , for happiness .
<unk> is what I &apos;ve seen .
And why ? Because they understand <unk> and <unk> <unk> patterns are the key to build <unk> structures .
<unk> is something about <unk> . But this is where it &apos;s interesting .
If you have a <unk> <unk> on the team , they become better .
It &apos;s incredible . They look around and see , &quot; This team will win . &quot;
You can <unk> this . Why is that ?
Because they have <unk> <unk> skills .
They <unk> the process , they understand it .
And <unk> team , <unk> and <unk> to work is going to improve the performance of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and their <unk> lead to success .
If you have 10 <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , you get about six , the <unk> structures .
I was trying to do something like this .
And I thought , well , let &apos;s get the <unk> out .
So I made a $ <unk> cost of software for the <unk> .
What do you think about that <unk> ?
What was the result ?
This is what happened . Not a team had a <unk> structure .
If <unk> had built a <unk> high <unk> , he would have <unk> the price home .
So isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> have a <unk> <unk> ?
We <unk> this <unk> with <unk> students .
What do you think about ?
Now , <unk> the advantage of the <unk> .
So , from <unk> , <unk> &apos;s team was under the best .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> time .
So we have <unk> <unk> for us , <unk> nature and success .
You might ask : Why would someone actually spend a <unk> to <unk> a <unk> ?
And the reason is , I use <unk> tools and <unk> to help <unk> , cars , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And what the <unk> does is she helps them <unk> <unk> .
Because <unk> said , every project has its own <unk> .
The challenge is an <unk> experience , a <unk> language <unk> <unk> to build the right <unk> .
And this is the value of this experience , this as simple <unk> .
And those of you who are interested in are <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , where you see the <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> there .
They find <unk> examples from around the world , how people <unk> the system and <unk> .
There &apos;s also <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> , I think , is that the <unk> is actually a <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> that we are all <unk> our <unk> to the task , and that we use our thinking to <unk> how our <unk> and our <unk> , in the challenge that <unk> us .
And sometimes a little <unk> of this experience everything it takes to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; to a <unk> .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you .
So let &apos;s think that we have a machine .
A big machine , a <unk> , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
And everyone in this room has to do it .
And you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
And I wonder what you would choose because I &apos;ve asked my friends in a lot of times , and they wanted to go to the past .
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before there was cars or <unk> or &quot; America <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I believe that you &apos;re sort of the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And I <unk> that .
I &apos;m not part of that group , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to be in the past , not because I &apos;m a <unk> .
It &apos;s because <unk> don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go <unk> .
So I want to get into this machine , and I want to go to the future .
This is the <unk> time ever ever on this planet , no matter what <unk> you <unk> : health , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There was never a time like this .
My <unk> <unk> everybody when they were 60 .
My <unk> <unk> this number to <unk> .
My parents are the 80 in the <unk> .
So there should be a lot of nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
But it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
A child living in <unk> will expect to live as long as the <unk> man in the world 100 years ago .
Think about it . That &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is that ?
The <unk> . The <unk> have killed billions of people on this planet .
They have <unk> the <unk> of the Earth in a way that no one has ever done .
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;re <unk> .
We <unk> them . <unk> .
In the rich world , <unk> that millions of us have <unk> a generation of a generation , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Do you know anybody who has this ?
<unk> , <unk> medicine , our ability to <unk> billions of people , they &apos;re <unk> of the scientific <unk> .
And from my view , the scientific <unk> , things <unk> , see if it works , it &apos;s going to change , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Now , <unk> is all the good news , because there are a bunch of other problems , and they &apos;re often <unk> .
And one of them is that , despite all of our <unk> a billion people on the world every day will go to <unk> .
That number <unk> , and it <unk> very fast , and that &apos;s <unk> .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our <unk> to <unk> this world .
<unk> , <unk> land , <unk> , oil , <unk> -- you &apos;re <unk> , and it &apos;s soon soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of that <unk> <unk> .
So the question is , can we do that ? I think .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will <unk> billions of people without <unk> the country they live on .
I think we can <unk> this world with energy that they don &apos;t <unk> at the same time .
I really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
But this is what <unk> me <unk> -- one of the things that <unk> me to be <unk> about . We &apos;ve never got scientific progress as <unk> as we can now .
And we have never been able to <unk> it as well as we can .
We &apos;re on the <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> on many <unk> , and yet I really think that we &apos;re going to go back and take over 300 years before the <unk> to find a time in which we have <unk> progress , where we have <unk> about these things <unk> , more <unk> than now .
People are <unk> in their belief , so <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> them .
Not even the truth is <unk> .
And you know , everybody has a right to his <unk> ; even a right to your mind .
But you know what you &apos;re not right ?
They don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t have it .
And I <unk> a <unk> to find that .
<unk> a decade ago , I wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; The New <unk> , &quot; a little article .
And I was <unk> to <unk> on <unk> , on <unk> to what at the end of the most <unk> <unk> in the history of humanity .
I didn &apos;t know what I was supposed to do , so I just did what I was doing , I wrote a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And soon , I wrote an article about <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The same thing , just bigger .
People <unk> crazy .
So I wrote a paper about this , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they <unk> that molecules <unk> in a certain kind of a <unk> kind of <unk> to the <unk> of nature .
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article , I went on .
I mean , I &apos;m <unk> .
We <unk> , we <unk> , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
But this article <unk> me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally I found it out .
And that &apos;s because these <unk> that were <unk> to me were not <unk> at all .
These were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
They were just like the people in this room .
And that made me so <unk> .
But then I thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
We are at a point where we don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> of progress as it used to be .
We talk about it .
We &apos;re talking about <unk> with small <unk> : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Okay , so there &apos;s reasons for that , and I think we know what reasons that is .
We have the trust in institutions , in <unk> , and sometimes <unk> in science , and there &apos;s no reason why this should not be .
You can just call a few names , and people will understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
I mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
There are questions and problems with the people that we feel that they &apos;re always right . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> questions , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You don &apos;t have to take any <unk> .
But here &apos;s : If you get <unk> , you have to <unk> these <unk> , and we &apos;re not good at that .
And I can do that because now we are now in a <unk> of <unk> , as I &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully I will never see again .
<unk> 12 years ago , a story came published , a <unk> story , <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Very <unk> .
<unk> studies were <unk> to see if that was <unk> .
<unk> studies should be done ; this is a <unk> <unk> .
The data came in .
The data came from the United States , from England , from <unk> , from <unk> , and they were all the same , no <unk> , no connection , no <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in <unk> , we think what we see , what we think we can see , what <unk> that we really feel .
We don &apos;t believe in a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> that gives us data , and I understand that , I think we all do that .
But you know what ?
The result of that was <unk> .
<unk> for this fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is <unk> for <unk> .
That &apos;s <unk> , and we should be <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
What happened we could do that .
Well , I <unk> that . I do that .
Because has someone <unk> here ?
<unk> a <unk> in the audience who see somebody in <unk> die ?
<unk> not very often .
<unk> in this country , not at all , but <unk> time in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of <unk> by <unk> , 20 per hour .
But because this is not happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like <unk> <unk> can be <unk> and <unk> by fear and <unk> of <unk> like <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they can do it because they don &apos;t <unk> and <unk> .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never <unk> .
And that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
This guy was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> us from one of the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
No fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The guy in the middle is not so much .
It &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
He &apos;s just developed a <unk> with a few other people .
It can save lives of <unk> , <unk> children a year in the developing world .
<unk> good , not ?
Now , that &apos;s good , except that Paul <unk> talks about and say how <unk> they are , and that people are simply <unk> to <unk> .
And that &apos;s actually what he says .
So Paul is a <unk> .
When Paul <unk> in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t <unk> without any <unk> .
He gets <unk> at home , because people like to tell him they know where his children go to school .
And why ? Because Paul has a <unk> .
I don &apos;t need to say that , but <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> them <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> disease , and that &apos;s happening .
We have now <unk> in this country now .
And that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die again because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of <unk> .
What about <unk> ? <unk> this . Why not ?
A friend of mine told me a couple of weeks ago , and I said I was a little bit <unk> .
No one has ever said this before .
She would not <unk> her child against <unk> . <unk> not .
<unk> .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have <unk> . And you know what ?
We had no <unk> in this country .
Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe <unk> <unk> in <unk> in a plane , and he &apos;s just <unk> <unk> , right now , he &apos;s over <unk> .
And in a few hours , he <unk> and <unk> a car , and he comes to <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s going to <unk> one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s the way the world works .
This is the <unk> that we live on . Don &apos;t <unk> like it &apos;s not .
We love to <unk> ourselves in <unk> . We love that .
Do you have all your <unk> today ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that <unk> you to the <unk> .
I know you did it because half of the Americans are doing it every day .
They take this stuff , and they take <unk> <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find it <unk> .
The data <unk> it all the time .
You <unk> your <unk> . They almost never .
That &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to <unk> <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> you completely .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Now , I think I <unk> -- we <unk> the <unk> .
We <unk> a strong government . We have no trust in the system .
And we shouldn &apos;t . Our <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing <unk> and <unk> to us who can afford it .
So we are walking away , and where do we walk ?
We walk in the <unk> of the <unk> .
This is <unk> . I love the <unk> .
But you know , this is a <unk> <unk> , because this stuff is <unk> , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
And I have all kinds of little <unk> here .
<unk> of it -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s <unk> .
And you know what ? When I say that , people <unk> me and say , &quot; What &apos;s it <unk> ? <unk> people do what they want .
That &apos;s what they feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? They have <unk> .
Because it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the <unk> saying , &quot; <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of my <unk> to <unk> , &quot; or <unk> <unk> , who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
If you go to this path where <unk> and <unk> <unk> and science <unk> , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
They go to <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> his people because he <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are much more <unk> than <unk> drugs that we know that they can <unk> the <unk> of AIDS .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a country that is worse than any other of this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things have no <unk> .
They have them . They always have it .
Now , the <unk> <unk> that we are right now is this <unk> struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> . She has to stop .
It &apos;s a <unk> about words , over <unk> .
That &apos;s <unk> , not science .
Everything we eat , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , has changed by the people .
You know , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
There was no <unk> . There was no <unk> . We did all this .
We &apos;ve done it in the last <unk> years .
And <unk> has worked and <unk> not .
We &apos;re <unk> , which doesn &apos;t work .
Now we can <unk> it . And of course , there &apos;s <unk> . But we can do something like <unk> A in <unk> , and that stuff can help millions of people to <unk> millions of people to <unk> their lives .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say that I don &apos;t .
We <unk> <unk> food .
Why do we do that ?
Now , what I &apos;ve been constantly <unk> is : <unk> many <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be huge <unk> with one thing , which is wrong .
We don &apos;t want companies to <unk> lives .
We don &apos;t want companies to have <unk> .
And you know what my answer is all about this ?
Yeah , you &apos;re right . <unk> this .
It &apos;s true , we have a <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
That has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s right , <unk> , <unk> .
You know that science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
She &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a <unk> , and it <unk> millions of people from the <unk> .
You know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
This <unk> in Africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
And why ? <unk> <unk> food .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that a <unk> billion people eat .
It &apos;s sort of like a <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s got no <unk> ; it doesn &apos;t have any <unk> , and scientists are doing all this .
And then people could eat it and won &apos;t be <unk> .
You wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , and you know what ?
That would be beautiful . It would not be <unk> , but it would be nice .
And all I can say is : Why are we doing this ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask : Why are we doing this ?
Because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
It &apos;s not about <unk> genes . It &apos;s not about <unk> .
It &apos;s not about our <unk> passion for <unk> , our lack of <unk> food , <unk> food , <unk> food .
It &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s getting time to understand what that means .
Because you know what ?
If we don &apos;t do that , if we do that , as we do so far , we &apos;re going to be <unk> to something that I think we don &apos;t want to be <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no other <unk> for what &apos;s happening here .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s our <unk> , and we have to really <unk> that .
So after this incredibly <unk> <unk> , you might want to say , &quot; Would you still go into these <unk> and go into the future ? &quot;
<unk> . That &apos;s what I want .
It &apos;s in the <unk> , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can put these <unk> on everything we want .
We can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them where we want .
We have to have these <unk> , and we have to think , but when we go into the <unk> and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be able to have that .
I know that we can do it , and I think it &apos;s a little thing about what the world needs now .
Thank you . Thank you .
When <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , one day through the streets of <unk> <unk> , he heard a <unk> music .
She came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who had <unk> on a <unk> that only had two <unk> .
A lot of you will be familiar with the story , because from <unk> &apos;s <unk> , later on a book , which was <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> at the <unk> , and his <unk> &apos;s <unk> career <unk> early early early early in the morning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> on the streets of <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> you all to read <unk> &apos;s book , or <unk> the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful <unk> that <unk> between these two men , but also how music <unk> this connection , and how she finally was the <unk> , when this <unk> is allowed to <unk> <unk> from the street .
I met <unk> <unk> in <unk> , two years ago , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He had just heard a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and came behind the stage to look at me .
He <unk> in a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and about how the <unk> would never create it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this was all because of the <unk> <unk> of the first <unk> in the last sentence by <unk> <unk> .
We came up with the <unk> <unk> of music , and a few days later , I got a <unk> <unk> who said that <unk> <unk> <unk> with me .
I have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> a medical treatment , because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> him his whole life .
So as a result , he &apos;s particularly <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re sometimes so <unk> that they <unk> him to <unk> , and he <unk> <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk> , always <unk> in this <unk> and the <unk> of his own <unk> .
And in the same time that <unk> was <unk> , when we started with our first <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he had lost this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and <unk> .
He was talking about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and about how someone <unk> him in the <unk> .
I was afraid , not <unk> , but I was afraid that I could lose him that he could <unk> into one of his <unk> , and that I could <unk> his relationship to <unk> if I <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> forms of <unk> <unk> .
So I just started playing .
I <unk> the first sentence by <unk> <unk> .
And while I was <unk> , I noticed that there was a <unk> change in <unk> .
It was as though he was under the impact of a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that <unk> my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in understanding , in a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
And as a <unk> , he took his <unk> and started to play a few <unk> of <unk> and then <unk> me to go to the end : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We started talking about music , starting by <unk> about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And I realized that he doesn &apos;t just <unk> a <unk> knowledge of music , but it also <unk> it with a <unk> personal relationship .
He talked about it with a passion and an understanding that I could only know about my colleagues in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> he <unk> music and <unk> about music , was out of this <unk> , <unk> man who was <unk> by the streets of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is medicine . <unk> changes us .
For <unk> , music is <unk> health .
Because the music allows him to <unk> his <unk> and <unk> with the help of his <unk> and creativity into something <unk> .
And so he <unk> his <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> that this is the nature of art .
And that &apos;s the reason why we make music , so that in all of us , <unk> in <unk> , our <unk> , through our <unk> , through our <unk> , through our creativity to reality .
And that reality <unk> <unk> <unk> all of us , moving , <unk> and <unk> .
What <unk> <unk> did , this music brought him back into a community of friends .
The <unk> power of music brought him back to a family of <unk> who <unk> him who saw his <unk> and <unk> it .
And I &apos;m going to go back to <unk> , no matter in the <unk> <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk> , because he <unk> me why I &apos;ve become <unk> .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : Thank you . Thank you .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : I want to play something that I <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
I hope you <unk> me .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> . I <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> for 10 years now , and my goal for the next <unk> is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , how to save it in <unk> .
I have a plan for this . I want to <unk> more people , <unk> to all of you , to spend more time with playing <unk> and <unk> games .
<unk> , we spend three billion hours a week of <unk> .
Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
Maybe something too much time , when you look at how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
But in fact , my research on <unk> for the future is exactly the opposite .
<unk> billion hours a week are not <unk> enough to solve the <unk> problems in the world .
In fact , I am <unk> that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to <unk> <unk> this time .
I have <unk> that the <unk> time in <unk> billion hours of <unk> per week .
Now , the <unk> <unk> may be a little bit <unk> , so I &apos;m going to <unk> it to be able to <unk> it , so if we want to solve problems like <unk> , poverty , climate change and <unk> <unk> , I think we have to try to do games online for at least <unk> billion hours a week .
No , it &apos;s really serious .
Why ? This picture <unk> quite <unk> .
I think games are so <unk> to the <unk> of human species in the future . <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He wanted the <unk> to play in . So he <unk> a camera before the <unk> .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> in games .
If you &apos;re not a <unk> , maybe some of the <unk> in this picture .
You probably see this <unk> for <unk> , some <unk> , but also <unk> <unk> , <unk> into the <unk> of a real <unk> <unk> .
If you play , you can see some <unk> here , which <unk> up on the top side , and the <unk> are a sign of <unk> . The <unk> show <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know . OK . <unk> .
So we have some <unk> here .
A <unk> <unk> is a result that &apos;s so <unk> that you didn &apos;t know it was possible .
It was <unk> &apos;s <unk> . And if you do it , you &apos;re <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> just before a <unk> <unk> .
And this is what we have to see in a million <unk> of <unk> around the world , if we take the <unk> of the next century in <unk> , the face of <unk> , the <unk> of all the <unk> on the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we &apos;re <unk> <unk> problems .
I <unk> it as the &quot; Life I am bad . &quot;
And it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? Yes ? OK .
That &apos;s me , like I am , &quot; in life , I am bad .
This is a <unk> in my <unk> <unk> in <unk> , California , where I <unk> in my <unk> why we are better in games than in real life .
This is a problem that many <unk> have .
We think we &apos;re not as good in the reality of play .
And I don &apos;t mean just less <unk> , even though that is .
We are <unk> more .
I mean , in the context of the <unk> to do something <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with each other .
When we &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , I think many of us <unk> into our best version , <unk> and immediately <unk> , <unk> to solve the problem as long as <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> <unk> .
And in reality , when we <unk> when we <unk> on <unk> , we &apos;re often feeling different .
We feel <unk> . We feel <unk> . We feel <unk> , maybe <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
These <unk> have never been , if we play games , they simply don &apos;t exist .
And that &apos;s what I wanted to look at as a <unk> .
Why is it impossible to think that you could not just reach everything ?
How can we <unk> these <unk> out of play into reality ?
So I looked at games like <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> environment to <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;ve <unk> some things that <unk> <unk> in <unk> can do so possible .
So , first of all , if you go to one of these <unk> <unk> , especially at <unk> of <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> that are willing to give you a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s immediately immediately .
But not just <unk> <unk> , but a <unk> that <unk> perfectly to your <unk> <unk> in the game , right ?
So you can do that .
You never get a task you can &apos;t solve .
But always the <unk> of your <unk> , so you have to <unk> .
But there &apos;s no <unk> in <unk> of <unk> . You don &apos;t sit around , and you &apos;re <unk> . There &apos;s always a little bit <unk> to do .
And there &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you go , <unk> of people <unk> with you to <unk> your <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t have that so easy in real life , that feeling that there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s this <unk> story , this <unk> story , why we are there and what we have , and then we <unk> this whole <unk> .
You have <unk> of &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
This <unk> <unk> is not in real life .
If I <unk> this stage , I didn &apos;t have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> &apos;s idea , <unk> 20 <unk> idea .
I don &apos;t <unk> in the <unk> life of that <unk> .
So , the problem of <unk> as <unk> of <unk> is that it &apos;s so <unk> to <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , that we <unk> to spend our time in these <unk> .
They &apos;re just better than reality .
<unk> today , all the <unk> of <unk> have spent <unk> million years trying to solve the <unk> problems of <unk> .
That &apos;s not necessarily a little <unk> .
It may sound <unk> .
But to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go .
So the first <unk> <unk> .
OK , so when we talk about it , how much time we spend <unk> play with play , it makes that sense when you look at the time in the <unk> of the <unk> of human development , what &apos;s <unk> .
But also <unk> , because it turns out that by <unk> all of this time , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re doing .
We develop to <unk> <unk> , <unk> creatures .
That &apos;s the truth . I think that &apos;s the truth .
<unk> this interesting <unk> that recently was published by a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> : the <unk> young man of today in a country with <unk> <unk> 10,000 hours with <unk> to the <unk> .
So , 10,000 hours is a <unk> interesting number , for two reasons .
First , for children in the United States , <unk> hours are the <unk> <unk> that they spend in school , from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- if you never <unk> . So we have a <unk> here .
<unk> , on the young people in the same way , what it means to be a good <unk> , like everything they learn in school .
And maybe some of you may have read the new book by <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; you know his theory of <unk> , the theory of 10,000 hours .
It &apos;s based on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> <unk> of an <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , we become <unk> in it .
We &apos;re going to do so well in doing whatever the <unk> people in the world are .
So , what we have here is a <unk> generation of <unk> people who are <unk> .
So the big question is , &quot; <unk> are <unk> <unk> good ? &quot;
Because if we could find out , we would never have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So many people we have <unk> in the world who spend at least one hour per day with <unk> .
These are our <unk> , 500 million people , who are good in &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And in the next decade , we have another billion <unk> that are <unk> well in whatever they are .
If you haven &apos;t heard it .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> energy and working on <unk> , rather than <unk> , so <unk> around the world , especially in India , China , can play online .
You expect a <unk> billion <unk> in the next decade .
So we have <unk> <unk> billion <unk> .
So I started <unk> what it is , let &apos;s make these games <unk> .
Here are the four things that I found . <unk> : <unk> .
OK , think about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> to immediately <unk> a <unk> , <unk> with the belief that we have a <unk> hope for success .
<unk> always believe that a <unk> <unk> is possible , and it always <unk> to try and <unk> it .
<unk> are not around .
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> that show that we like people more after we <unk> with them , even though they have <unk> us .
And the reason is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
We <unk> that every time with us <unk> that the rules will <unk> that we have the same goal and to the <unk> .
So this <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , trust and <unk> .
As a result , we build <unk> social relationships .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> !
You know , there &apos;s one reason why the <unk> of <unk> is playing <unk> hours a week , like <unk> .
The reason is that , when we play , we &apos;re actually <unk> to work hard than if we <unk> or not .
We know that as human beings , we are <unk> , when we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> work .
And <unk> are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
And ultimately , <unk> meaning .
<unk> love it to be part of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a <unk> to <unk> that into the <unk> light , <unk> all the <unk> , the largest <unk> in the world .
The <unk> <unk> in the world , with almost <unk> <unk> , is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> million people use it every month .
They have more information on the <unk> of <unk> on the Internet than about <unk> other <unk> in any other <unk> in the world .
They create a <unk> story .
They create a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> .
OK , so these are four <unk> that lead to a single <unk> . <unk> are <unk> , <unk> individuals .
They are people who believe they can change the world .
And the only problem is they think they can change the <unk> <unk> , but not the <unk> .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
His work is <unk> .
People spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re going to get <unk> of less than a <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
And this is a <unk> . So he &apos;s <unk> .
And he says -- not like me -- I <unk> games , I &apos;m a little <unk> .
So he says that the <unk> actually make sense , because <unk> can reach more than in real life .
They can <unk> social <unk> than in real life , they get more <unk> and more <unk> in games than in real life .
So he says it &apos;s <unk> completely <unk> that <unk> spend more time in the real world than in the real world .
I &apos;m just going to <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
But it &apos;s not <unk> .
We have to start to transform the real world into a game .
My <unk> comes from a <unk> that <unk> <unk> years .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> , from <unk> . You know ?
<unk> these <unk> <unk> , there were <unk> .
And that was sort of the first people developed <unk> , and if you &apos;re with the <unk> of the old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you may know this story . The story about how and why games were invented .
<unk> <unk> were <unk> , more <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> during a <unk> .
In <unk> , there was such a big <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to a <unk> idea .
<unk> people . People <unk> .
It was a <unk> situation . You needed a <unk> solution .
So they asked , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and a day would eat . The next day you would play .
And they would be so <unk> in the <unk> , because games are so <unk> and <unk> with <unk> , <unk> <unk> that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
And <unk> <unk> , she was doing this <unk> for 18 years , by going to <unk> and <unk> the next <unk> .
<unk> , I think we &apos;re <unk> .
We put games in order to <unk> the <unk> of the real world . We put games on , to <unk> everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not <unk> in real life , and we take us what we need from games .
But it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> was not going to do the <unk> for 18 years , so the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> .
It <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> , and they went to search for a new <unk> , and they were just going back so many people as there were <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> with the rest of a <unk> that they could <unk> in .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But <unk> <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> that later <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the same DNA as the old <unk> <unk> .
So scientists recently came to the <unk> that <unk> &apos;s <unk> is actually true .
And <unk> found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years of what the <unk> might explain .
So this <unk> <unk> could <unk> .
In fact , they were actually <unk> their <unk> through play by <unk> for 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> , and so much about the <unk> <unk> that they <unk> all the <unk> .
So we can .
We &apos;ve been playing for <unk> <unk> .
This was the first <unk> in <unk> .
This was the <unk> of <unk> . This was 16 years ago .
It <unk> for 18 years , we have been playing <unk> for 16 years .
I <unk> we are ready for our own <unk> game .
So , they <unk> half of their <unk> to look for a new world , so I &apos;m going to take my <unk> billion <unk> a week .
We should <unk> that half of us have an hour per day , until we have the problems of the real world .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems of the real world
And exactly this question , I &apos;ve <unk> my work in the <unk> for the future .
We have this <unk> in our office in <unk> , it <unk> out how to understand the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
What we want to do is create the future .
We want to <unk> the <unk> result , and then people <unk> to <unk> that idea into reality .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and give people the opportunities to achieve them .
I &apos;m going to show you about three games that I &apos;ve designed to try to try and <unk> people together in their own future .
This is &quot; <unk> without oil . &quot;
The game is from <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> where you have to <unk> a <unk> .
The <unk> is invented , but we have <unk> <unk> so that it &apos;s <unk> for you , and you &apos;re actually going to live without oil without oil . So , if you go to play , tell us where you &apos;re going , and then you get <unk> in <unk> that show you how much oil is not , like <unk> <unk> ,
As <unk> is <unk> , whether schools are <unk> , and you have to figure out how to make your <unk> life , if it would be true , and we &apos;re asking you to <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and we <unk> it over the last three years .
And I can tell you it was an <unk> experience .
<unk> wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
But if you &apos;re in a <unk> and you say , &quot; <unk> is the oil . &quot;
This is a <unk> <unk> that you are on .
<unk> out how to survive . Most of our <unk> have <unk> in the game .
So for the next <unk> game , we have <unk> a <unk> , <unk> goal than just <unk> .
We created the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the <unk> for the future .
<unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> that people only have <unk> years on the planet .
This <unk> is called <unk> <unk> <unk> , of course .
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , we were almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
They know <unk> <unk> , where they have the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they have the <unk> , the scientists , the <unk> and only together , they can save the world .
But in our play , instead of just five people , we say , everyone &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the game for eight weeks .
They found 500 incredibly <unk> solutions that you can <unk> if you <unk> <unk> .
And this is the last game we <unk> out on the <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a game in <unk> with the <unk> .
If you <unk> the game , you get <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re working with <unk> in very <unk> , and we asked them to learn how to learn <unk> .
We have a <unk> . We have <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , vision and <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to share all of you to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in <unk> who <unk> to <unk> their own social <unk> to save the world .
I &apos;m going to go to the end .
I want to ask you a little bit .
What do you think happens as a <unk> ?
We have all these <unk> <unk> , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have the real world yet .
<unk> , I hope you &apos;re <unk> to me that there are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
We have all these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the ability to <unk> <unk> social <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> meaning .
I really hope that we &apos;re playing <unk> games to play another century on this planet .
And I hope you &apos;ll design these play with me and play .
When I go to the next <unk> , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m <unk> with two things : that we can create every <unk> future , and that we can play all sorts of games . So I say , <unk> , the <unk> start .
<unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> for the <unk> for a long time . It may seem like a <unk> to be interested in it , because , you look like me , as I say , as a <unk> <unk> to something , if someone &apos;s <unk> enough to believe enough .
In some studies , <unk> have shown a <unk> <unk> in some studies , the <unk> , and only <unk> , because the person think that what happens to you is a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there is , if the <unk> <unk> only to believe enough , a <unk> <unk> in the body called the <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> will <unk> into something , because somebody &apos;s so <unk> .
So for us to understand , I want to show you a <unk> , very simple <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a <unk> that <unk> at least since the <unk> in every <unk> .
I myself learned it from the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> him for you and explain him .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I <unk> it .
So , look what happens .
The <unk> you can study , my hand you can study .
I will just keep the <unk> in my <unk> .
I <unk> my <unk> back .
And to <unk> that there is nothing in my <unk> <unk> or from him , I &apos;m just going to <unk> my <unk> right there .
In this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything . <unk> I <unk> here can &apos;t be in my <unk> or <unk> .
And the goal is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the <unk> will <unk> through my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s actually <unk> in this room that I can <unk> it without <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in my <unk> or comes out , not <unk> . And you can <unk> everything .
<unk> !
Now , this is a <unk> that I often <unk> small kids who are interested in <unk> , because you can learn a lot about <unk> when you <unk> <unk> , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> .
<unk> , many of you know this in the <unk> of this <unk> .
He works <unk> .
I hold that <unk> in my hand .
I say I <unk> my <unk> to make sure that nothing in my <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and this is a <unk> .
The reason I <unk> my <unk> is that there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
In the moment , where I <unk> my hand from you , so you see it from <unk> , this <unk> here , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where he &apos;s so <unk> .
<unk> <unk> ?
There is somebody who has no childhood .
So he &apos;s here . That &apos;s right .
And when I look at me , the <unk> changes its position .
And now you could talk about why it &apos;s a <unk> , why you don &apos;t realize there &apos;s just three <unk> on the bottom : because the mind and the way it <unk> information , it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
But that &apos;s really what it &apos;s really about now . And then I <unk> my hand .
Of course , it will be there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a <unk> , through my <unk> , who is now there .
And when I <unk> my hand , the same thing I &apos;m going to do is <unk> through this <unk> that the <unk> <unk> .
I take that hand away . And here &apos;s the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> can <unk> your friends and <unk> . Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
A year ago or so , I <unk> a study that really <unk> me right .
I &apos;m not a doctor or <unk> , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
So it turns out this : If you <unk> a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a <unk> , <unk> <unk> that has <unk> a certain <unk> .
But if you look at the shape in which you <unk> the <unk> , for example , in a <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> on it , it &apos;s actually <unk> <unk> .
And that , though , none of them -- they &apos;re just <unk> .
But a <unk> <unk> is not as good as a <unk> <unk> .
What ? It really made me <unk> .
It turns out that it &apos;s not all .
When you take <unk> , it &apos;s more <unk> than any <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> at an end , and the other is better than a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> also <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> is not as good as three <unk> a day -- I can &apos;t remember the <unk> <unk> . <unk> me .
And the <unk> is , ...
The <unk> also play a role .
And the shape is <unk> .
And if you want to have the <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> ? A <unk> with a <unk> -- some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that you <unk> to a patient .
This creates a very <unk> picture in your head . It &apos;s much more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> is really -- I &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a <unk> .
So the fact is that the <unk> <unk> did not <unk> as well as the <unk> <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> as well as a <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> as well as the <unk> .
And none of this has really <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s just our <unk> that <unk> in us a <unk> <unk> .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a <unk> , and <unk> it look real .
So we know from <unk> trial that you have to <unk> to the <unk> when it &apos;s supposed to go .
This is a 18 <unk> long <unk> . She &apos;s very , very <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go through a little bit of a little bit .
This is really my <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is my skin . This is not a <unk> from <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> these <unk> into my skin , and then <unk> through it , <unk> it down on the other side .
If you &apos;re <unk> -- if you &apos;re slightly <unk> in <unk> -- I have <unk> this a couple of friends in <unk> , and some people that I don &apos;t <unk> , and this is a woman almost <unk> .
So , I <unk> if you get <unk> fast , then look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , I &apos;m going to make the first <unk> part here .
You can see it directly , you can also <unk> if you want to .
So , it &apos;s like , right here , where my <unk> <unk> , at the <unk> part of my <unk> , I &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
I &apos;m really <unk> . <unk> you crazy ?
And just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had <unk> .
<unk> .
But now you can &apos;t <unk> my <unk> , right ?
So I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Well .
I know what people think when they see that .
They say , &quot; Okay , it &apos;s not that <unk> and <unk> the skin just to <unk> for us a few minutes . &quot;
Well , then I &apos;ll show it to you .
What does this look like ? <unk> well .
Yeah , I know . And people said , &quot; Okay . I haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
The people in the <unk> are coming in .
Let me show you close .
This is really my skin . This is not a <unk> from <unk> .
This is my <unk> , and I can <unk> that .
<unk> . If you &apos;re <unk> , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
People would say , or the ones that later , at some point , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; Well , this looks fairly <unk> , but if it was really , it would -- you know , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it was really real , it would <unk> . &quot;
Okay , let me <unk> a little blood for you .
Yes , there it is .
So now I would <unk> the <unk> .
I would <unk> my arm and show you that there are no <unk> .
But I think , in this <unk> here , and with the <unk> to make a <unk> out of a <unk> , I &apos;m just going to let the <unk> go there and go like that .
We &apos;re going to <unk> a few times in the next few days .
I hope you guys <unk> on it . Thank you .
So I have a lot of fish in my life .
I only have two <unk> .
This first , this was more like a <unk> <unk> .
It was a <unk> fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> on the <unk> .
What a fish .
Even better , he was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
So you could feel comfortable with him .
I had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
One day , the <unk> of the company <unk> up and asked if I could <unk> in a <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> .
&quot; Of course , &quot; I said .
Here was a company that was trying to solve what this <unk> problem has become , and how do we <unk> fish on our <unk> ?
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> <unk> of how we <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s hard to <unk> the <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s almost nothing more <unk> .
So <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is going to be part of our future .
A lot of <unk> against it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , we take <unk> . A big <unk> .
It has a <unk> of 15 to one .
That means that 15 <unk> <unk> are <unk> so you get a <unk> <unk> .
Not very <unk> .
Not very good at all .
So finally , finally a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to <unk> them .
On the day of <unk> , I <unk> the <unk> of <unk> for the company .
Let &apos;s <unk> him .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said , &quot; just to have the facts right , their <unk> <unk> so far out in the ocean so that you don &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We are so far out there , the <unk> of our fish is <unk> , not <unk> . &quot;
And then he <unk> , &quot; We &apos;re essentially a <unk> world .
This <unk> of <unk> to <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; The best in the <unk> . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? What are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said . <unk> .
And that night I was in the <unk> , and I thought , what the hell is a <unk> <unk> ?
So I <unk> the next day , just before the <unk> , <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> , what for example are <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
He said he doesn &apos;t like that . He &apos;s going to <unk> .
Now , I <unk> with a bunch of people in the company . No one could give me an <unk> answer , until I finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s <unk> it as well .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said , &quot; What are <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Well , he <unk> some <unk> and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; How much percent <unk> is <unk> ? &quot;
In the <unk> of maybe two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; <unk> , what is <unk> about getting <unk> to fish ? &quot;
There was a long <unk> in the <unk> , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much <unk> in the world . &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> by this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m an <unk> and <unk> .
That &apos;s me .
No , I &apos;m actually <unk> by this fish because , I &apos;m <unk> by God , the fish after that <unk> after <unk> .
This second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of <unk> .
It &apos;s the most <unk> way , the way you learn to know your fish , you learn more <unk> .
I first <unk> it in a <unk> in <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> had <unk> since <unk> by this fish since <unk> .
She &apos;s <unk> us .
He came to the table with a <unk> , almost <unk> <unk> color .
The <unk> had <unk> him .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> , he was still <unk> .
Who can <unk> a fish so well after he got <unk> ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s <unk> it . In fact , he &apos;s <unk> .
And no , he doesn &apos;t <unk> the fish , and he &apos;s not a <unk> . <unk> the way you and I understand .
He &apos;s a <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> corner .
It &apos;s close to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> was in the hands of <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> on what was basically <unk> .
They did that by <unk> the country .
They <unk> this <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and they <unk> water out of the country and out of the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t <unk> that the <unk> , not <unk> .
And <unk> , it was a <unk> .
It brought about 90 percent of the <unk> <unk> , which are many <unk> for this place .
And so <unk> <unk> a <unk> company with <unk> .
What did they do ?
They <unk> the flow of <unk> .
They literally <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the water , it <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the water .
She <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and then <unk> and his company <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
It <unk> out on the <unk> , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> <unk> and this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t there at the time with <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , three parts of <unk> <unk> and part of &quot; A <unk> to <unk> . &quot;
Okay ? So there we were , and <unk> us through the <unk> , and I <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up to my <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in <unk> a <unk> .
Here he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now he <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
And here , there &apos;s a pattern of <unk> <unk> him to the <unk> <unk> .
It turns out that <unk> has spent the most part of his career in <unk> <unk> in Africa .
I asked him how he &apos;s become such a <unk> .
He said , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m a <unk> for relationships . &quot;
And then he goes and <unk> into more <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , which was really <unk> , you know , the <unk> community , like that in the <unk> .
It &apos;s great , but I was <unk> .
And my head was <unk> on this <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> that I had at <unk> .
So I <unk> him . I said , &quot; <unk> , what is it that <unk> fish <unk> so good ? &quot;
He showed the <unk> .
&quot; I know , boy , the <unk> , the <unk> , the relationships , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
But what do <unk> eat fish ?
What &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
Well , he <unk> to tell me that it &apos;s such a <unk> system that the fish eat what they eat in the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish <unk> .
The system is so <unk> , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , who don &apos;t <unk> their animals ?
<unk> the day , I <unk> up on this <unk> with <unk> , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place to be so , of course , &quot; different than any <unk> that I &apos;d ever been , &quot; How do you success ? &quot;
It was like a <unk> was <unk> a <unk> .
And we <unk> around the corner , and we <unk> the <unk> <unk> , thousands and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the eye .
&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; <unk> <unk> her <unk> , <unk> .
She <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t they <unk> fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the <unk> .
Now , last year on this <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than <unk> different species .
This is the largest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> in Europe today .
I said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the <unk> you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
He <unk> his head , no .
He said , &quot; We build <unk> , not <unk> .
This is a <unk> network .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
So the more <unk> the <unk> , the better the <unk> . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s <unk> that . A <unk> that <unk> their animals and a <unk> that <unk> their success on the health of their <unk> .
A <unk> , but also a <unk> .
Oh , and <unk> should not even be there .
It <unk> in a city <unk> miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , they fly <unk> miles to <unk> .
And every night they fly <unk> miles back .
They do it because they can follow the <unk> <unk> line of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
I had a sort of <unk> of <unk> <unk> , so I looked at <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> , fly <unk> miles to the <unk> and do they fly <unk> miles back ?
Is they the kids ? &quot;
He looked at me like I was <unk> a song of <unk> <unk> .
He said , &quot; No . You do it because the food is better . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the skin of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> , and I don &apos;t like <unk> . I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it .
It &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I almost never <unk> with it .
And yet , when I put them in this <unk> in <unk> , they didn &apos;t actually <unk> to <unk> .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> , like you would take a <unk> from the ocean .
I <unk> this to <unk> and he <unk> .
He said , &quot; The skin <unk> like a <unk> .
It &apos;s the last <unk> before something <unk> into the body .
It &apos;s been <unk> over time to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then he <unk> , &quot; But our water has no <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> their fish , a <unk> that <unk> their success at success .
And then I realized when he says a <unk> that has no <unk> , he <unk> <unk> , because the water that comes through these <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a river that <unk> all the things that <unk> <unk> today to lead them , <unk> them , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
And when it <unk> through the system , and that <unk> is <unk> the water as it &apos;s <unk> .
The system is so <unk> , it <unk> the water .
So not just a <unk> that <unk> their animals , not just a <unk> that <unk> their success on the health of their <unk> , but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> , not just for those fish , but for <unk> and me .
Because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the <unk> .
A <unk> in the ocean , I know , but I <unk> it , and that should be done , because these <unk> , like <unk> , is also <unk> .
You might say that she &apos;s a <unk> for the future of good <unk> whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
What we need now is a <unk> new concept of agriculture , from one , where <unk> actually <unk> well .
But for many people , that &apos;s a bit too <unk> .
We are not <unk> , we <unk> . We are <unk> .
We love <unk> . We love small <unk> . We talk about <unk> <unk> . We eat <unk> .
And if you <unk> that these are the things that the future of good <unk> <unk> <unk> up somewhere and says , &quot; Hey people , I love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to <unk> the world ?
How are you going to <unk> the world ? &quot;
<unk> I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like that question .
No , not because we already produce enough <unk> to <unk> the world more than just .
A billion people are <unk> today .
A billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , not the <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t like that question because it has been the <unk> of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> to the Earth , <unk> on fish , and all the time the <unk> was asking , &quot; If we <unk> more people , how <unk> can that be ? &quot;
This was the <unk> . It was the <unk> . It was the <unk> of the American agriculture .
We should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> fast <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> these <unk> .
This is not <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our <unk> is <unk> today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
Not by <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> land , not by <unk> , but by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> , and not by <unk> and not by <unk> and <unk> , but by the fish in the ocean .
You want to <unk> the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to <unk> ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create conditions that have <unk> every community to <unk> themselves ?
In order to do that , don &apos;t look at the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> and machines are <unk> in it , and it has never made a really good for food .
Let &apos;s look at the <unk> model .
That &apos;s what <unk> on two billion years .
Look at <unk> , <unk> like <unk> .
<unk> that are not <unk> for themselves , <unk> that are <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> , <unk> that are not just <unk> , <unk> who are not just <unk> , but <unk> for relationships .
They are the ones who are <unk> for <unk> .
And if I &apos;m really honest , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> than I ever be .
You know , it &apos;s pretty , because if that &apos;s the future of the future , it will be <unk> .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In my <unk> , I <unk> with the <unk> to school , every day per hour per <unk> .
And my <unk> always <unk> in a book , a <unk> <unk> that <unk> my mind in other <unk> , and <unk> me in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> also <unk> that I was always when I wasn &apos;t in school , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> everything , and <unk> under the <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> , you know .
It was always about trying to understand the world and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
And my love to <unk> <unk> seemed to be <unk> in my environment , because then , in the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> to the moon and <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> came into our <unk> with his <unk> <unk> that <unk> us animals and places and a world of <unk> that we had never <unk> before .
So , I think that &apos;s pretty good at <unk> <unk> .
And I was an artist .
I could <unk> . I could <unk> .
And because there were no <unk> of <unk> <unk> that were still <unk> the whole <unk> in the <unk> , I had to create the images in my head .
We all had to do that at the time . If we were children as a child , we took the <unk> of the <unk> and we <unk> it to the <unk> in our <unk> .
My response was the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all that .
In <unk> , I was constantly <unk> by teachers , like I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> had to <unk> out .
And what happened was something fascinating , because what <unk> me about <unk> <unk> <unk> was the idea of an <unk> world here on our Earth itself .
<unk> , I would never <unk> a <unk> world with a <unk> . It seemed quite <unk> .
But here was a world that I could actually <unk> , here on Earth , and it was as <unk> and <unk> as all of what I used to do when I read these books .
So I <unk> when I was 15 , when I was 15 .
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in <unk> , <unk> miles away from the next ocean .
But I didn &apos;t get <unk> .
I <unk> my father , until he finally finally made a <unk> in <unk> , New York , <unk> , on the other side of the <unk> , where we <unk> .
I made my <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> in the middle of <unk> in <unk> , New York .
But the ocean , but a real ocean , I got to the face two years later , looking for California .
In <unk> , in the 40 years of <unk> <unk> , I spent about <unk> hours of water , 500 hours of them in <unk> .
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of <unk> , even in the <unk> <unk> , is so <unk> to <unk> life , as we can really <unk> to .
<unk> of nature doesn &apos;t know <unk> , <unk> to our own , <unk> human <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , I <unk> <unk> <unk> for what I see on my <unk> .
And my love to the ocean <unk> , with <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> .
When I looked at a <unk> , it was the <unk> .
That seemed to be the best way to <unk> my <unk> , to tell stories , to create images with my <unk> .
As a child , I <unk> <unk> and stuff like that .
So <unk> were the path to <unk> images and stories . The <unk> together .
Of course , the stories I came from from the <unk> was &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
In &quot; <unk> &quot; I could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk> .
So <unk> <unk> my two <unk> .
<unk> <unk> happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; in order to solve a <unk> problem in that movie -- and that is that we had to create a sort of <unk> <unk> , so we <unk> on <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
What <unk> was the first <unk> <unk> ever to see in a movie .
The film didn &apos;t take any money , exactly what he did , he <unk> his <unk> , but let me <unk> something : the audience in the world was like <unk> from the <unk> who was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s law is <unk> <unk> technology and <unk> no longer <unk> to <unk> .
So they saw something <unk> .
And I found that <unk> <unk> .
And I was like , &quot; <unk> , this must be <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
So we went to &quot; <unk> 2 , &quot; my next movie , still a lot further .
<unk> with <unk> , we were <unk> the guy from <unk> <unk> , and the success was <unk> by what this <unk> would be <unk> .
And it <unk> . <unk> , we had created something new , and the <unk> in the audience was the same , and we had a little bit more money with the movie .
From these two experiences , a whole new world has been <unk> , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
So I <unk> a company , along with my good friend <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> at the time of the best <unk> .
The <unk> of this company was to <unk> the <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , and start to start with <unk> <unk> .
And then we did that , and we <unk> a <unk> like this .
But in the middle of the <unk> , we were <unk> that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- let &apos;s <unk> the company , actually , to slow down .
I had written this piece &quot; <unk> , &quot; which should be the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> into very new <unk> , with <unk> human , <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> should all be <unk> . And the world should be <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we were not able to do that .
So I <unk> this , and I did this other movie about the big <unk> , the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , I <unk> this as &quot; <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> , &quot; a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> movie .
But <unk> , I really wanted to go to the real <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , I did the movie .
That &apos;s the truth . The <unk> didn &apos;t know that .
But I really <unk> them by saying , &quot; We were <unk> to the <unk> . We <unk> the real <unk> .
We &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
That &apos;s <unk> important . It &apos;s a good <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And I asked them to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> crazy . But that goes back to the fact that your <unk> can make a reality .
In fact , what we did is we <unk> a reality that I <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the <unk> , and I <unk> the real <unk> through a <unk> .
This was not a movie , no <unk> , it was real .
So that really <unk> me .
And the <unk> were <unk> . We had to <unk> , and we had to <unk> and build everything .
And I noticed how much this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
Well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> into these <unk> , then you <unk> into these <unk> , <unk> environment , where there &apos;s no hope for <unk> when you don &apos;t get it back .
And I thought , &quot; <unk> , that &apos;s just like I was in a <unk> .
That &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> that <unk> with <unk> and science . It was everything . It was <unk> , it was <unk> . It was <unk> .
And it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me <unk> .
Because , you know , I was able to imagine a <unk> for which we could make a <unk> <unk> , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside the <unk> .
In some of the most <unk> <unk> , I saw creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before and for the science at the time when we saw it , not even words .
So I got really excited about this , and I wanted more .
And so I made a slightly <unk> decision .
After the success of &quot; <unk> , &quot; I said to myself , &quot; Okay , I want to put my <unk> as a <unk> in <unk> on ice , and I will <unk> for a <unk> . &quot;
And then we started <unk> this <unk> .
We <unk> to the <unk> , and we <unk> them with <unk> .
We went back to the <unk> of <unk> .
We took little robot that we had built , which <unk> a <unk> .
Our <unk> was <unk> , <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , which had never been done before .
No one had ever <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the <unk> technology .
And then I &apos;m <unk> , on the <unk> of the <unk> , in a <unk> , and I see <unk> that are quite <unk> in this <unk> , and I know that <unk> has the <unk> there .
And I <unk> with a little <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m really <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the <unk> .
It felt like I was <unk> within the <unk> of <unk> .
That was the most <unk> form of a <unk> I &apos;ve ever <unk> , because before I <unk> around a corner , I always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the <unk> , because I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when we <unk> the film .
And that was a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So this was an <unk> <unk> experience .
And she made me realize this <unk> that you use such <unk> <unk> , and so you use your consciousness into the <unk> , into this other form of <unk> .
It was really <unk> .
And maybe a little <unk> on what might be done in some <unk> , if you have <unk> to <unk> something or do other things in all possible <unk> that I can think of as a <unk> .
After these <unk> , we started what we saw down there , really <unk> , like this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly <unk> animals , and these are <unk> <unk> , but here on <unk> .
They &apos;re living with <unk> .
They don &apos;t exist in a <unk> <unk> system like we do .
And so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees <unk> .
<unk> are living . And you can &apos;t imagine that they can survive there .
At the same time , I was very interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood .
And so I <unk> to the people who care about the <unk> , and they have to do with the <unk> and they sit in the <unk> , and they go to the <unk> , and they go to the right <unk> , and they go to <unk> , and they go to <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and then they go to the <unk> , then fly to the <unk> <unk> and take our <unk> .
That was <unk> .
But at the end , it got out that I took <unk> with us .
I took them up , and I <unk> them to the world at the bottom : <unk> , <unk> , people <unk> for these kinds of <unk> <unk> , and I took them to the <unk> so they could <unk> , <unk> and test <unk> and so on .
Now , we <unk> <unk> , but actually science , actually said , <unk> .
So the <unk> between my <unk> as <unk> , then as a child , and the <unk> in reality .
I &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
I learned a lot about science , but I also learned a lot about <unk> .
Now , you know , a <unk> also has to lead , a <unk> like a <unk> or something .
I don &apos;t use a lot of <unk> before I <unk> this <unk> .
Because at some point , I had to say to myself , &quot; Well , what do I do here ?
Why are I doing this ? What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
These <unk> <unk> don &apos;t bring us any money .
We &apos;re just going to play the <unk> . It &apos;s not a <unk> .
Everybody think I was between &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and would have been the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got all these <unk> , these <unk> , for a very small audience .
No <unk> , no <unk> , no money . What are you doing ?
You <unk> it around the task to <unk> the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that you have . You <unk> it for <unk> , and because of the <unk> connection that <unk> when a small group of people <unk> a team .
Because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and sometimes we were two to three months of <unk> on <unk> .
And in this community , you <unk> that the most important thing you have is the most <unk> thing you have before each other , because you &apos;ve got a problem that you can explain <unk> other things .
If you go to the country and you say , &quot; We had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the whole technology , and the <unk> , the human <unk> , when you &apos;re working on <unk> , &quot; you can &apos;t really explain to the other things . It &apos;s like <unk> or <unk> who have done something in common and know that they can never explain to someone .
There &apos;s a connection , a <unk> <unk> .
So when I started to make my next film &quot; <unk> , &quot; I was trying to make <unk> <unk> , that you would <unk> his team and <unk> yourself in the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> was really changed .
So I was <unk> with a small team on <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; with a new technology that we didn &apos;t have before .
<unk> <unk> .
A <unk> challenge .
And we became a real family for <unk> years .
<unk> , my way of making <unk> is completely <unk> .
There were people who were <unk> , and we really had these <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
For me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the <unk> process , which has changed in the <unk> .
So what can we <unk> out of all this ?
What <unk> did we learn ?
I think that &apos;s what <unk> is about .
It &apos;s the <unk> human <unk> .
Our <unk> is a force that can actually create a reality .
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> is more important than any <unk> in the world .
To me , young <unk> who say , &quot; <unk> me a <unk> of how I can do something like this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t take you .
It &apos;s <unk> to you . Don &apos;t <unk> it , don &apos;t <unk> to yourself . <unk> your <unk> on you . &quot;
The <unk> has such a <unk> : &quot; <unk> is not a <unk> . &quot;
But in art and <unk> , <unk> must be a <unk> , because there &apos;s a <unk> there .
No <unk> <unk> to <unk> the innovation , no one has been <unk> .
You have to be willing to take those <unk> .
So that &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to share with you . <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> , but it &apos;s not . Thank you .
Now , if I want to <unk> to you today , the <unk> of the data that we &apos;re <unk> is bigger than the <unk> of their <unk> , and instead of <unk> in <unk> , I &apos;d like you to think about how we can use information , that <unk> <unk> and we see so <unk> that might not have been <unk> .
So , what we &apos;re seeing here is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The program that I &apos;m <unk> here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> , and what I can do with <unk> is that I can <unk> after a certain <unk> , we say <unk> .
And immediately , I see a different pattern that <unk> .
And that &apos;s because in the <unk> , people are <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> here .
We can go one step further , and then <unk> the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the <unk> <unk> , but not for everyone .
Now , when we go back and <unk> by age , we say 40 years or <unk> , we see that <unk> is even the <unk> of people to worry about .
And who <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s particularly <unk> in men .
So you can see that the <unk> of information and data in this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And if we can do this for <unk> , why not for <unk> ?
What we have here is the <unk> every single &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which have ever been <unk> .
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online .
I want you to test it in your <unk> .
With <unk> , they can <unk> into a <unk> .
You can <unk> in a <unk> year .
You can <unk> directly to a certain <unk> .
Now , when I look here , I see the <unk> that <unk> in this <unk> and the <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> <unk> , so I <unk> <unk> <unk> to me all the <unk> in which <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
Now , if I just want to get a <unk> <unk> , I could think , &quot; Okay , what if I <unk> everything about this <unk> ? &quot;
So I go back and I <unk> the <unk> .
Now I see <unk> <unk> .
And so you get an idea that when you look at this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t just <unk> or <unk> just .
You do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s something <unk> , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
So I want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and put it on a little <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a quick <unk> and a <unk> for the <unk> that comes from .
I &apos;m just going to show the <unk> 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
But even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
And then we get a <unk> of the <unk> that are on <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> government .
Well , after I <unk> &apos; government , I <unk> that the <unk> that <unk> most <unk> <unk> of <unk> people are <unk> .
This is really important because this is a <unk> that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
That &apos;s just to recognize when you look at a step and look at it .
In <unk> to one particular <unk> , I can then go into the <unk> of <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> and see all together .
Now , when I look at all these <unk> , I <unk> that the <unk> are <unk> from this . Some of them come from science . Some , even less , come from the economy . Here &apos;s my <unk> . And one comes out of the <unk> .
And <unk> is also a TED <unk> <unk> .
So now we can go back and look at all of the TED <unk> <unk> .
So you can see , in the Web , the first time it &apos;s really a network , not just from the side , it &apos;s much more <unk> .
And so I want to show you what different <unk> might be .
I &apos;m just going to show you the New York Times <unk> here .
<unk> , this <unk> -- I don &apos;t want to call it a <unk> ; it &apos;s really not a <unk> , but you can look at it -- and we bring these <unk> to every single <unk> like this .
So I can <unk> one step , and I can go directly to a <unk> <unk> .
So this is important because you can only look at the <unk> of <unk> in this way , all the <unk> in the same way .
So I can go to my <unk> <unk> in a particular <unk> .
Here &apos;s the <unk> of the whole <unk> that I &apos;ve <unk> to <unk> .
And I can sort of <unk> everything I &apos;ve been <unk> for today .
And if I take a step back and <unk> to everything , I can <unk> my <unk> , perhaps after my <unk> . Here , I <unk> to <unk> , here after <unk> , or <unk> here to <unk> <unk> .
And from here I can go to the side and <unk> them again .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s been used again , and every time it does the <unk> bigger than the <unk> of the <unk> .
Right now , in this world , we think that data is a <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about the <unk> of information .
What if we could <unk> this situation , and put the Internet on the head , so that instead of being <unk> from one to the other , then we start to go from a lot of things to lots of things , and <unk> patterns that would be <unk> <unk> ?
If we can do that , then this <unk> will <unk> , maybe a new <unk> of <unk> information .
And , rather than just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
And when we experience knowledge , then maybe we can even pull out of it .
So I <unk> , thank you very much .
Everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
I &apos;ve got some people <unk> the number of books that have been published with &quot; <unk> &quot; in <unk> in the last five years , and they gave me about 40 , and there &apos;s a lot more .
There &apos;s an <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of happiness under <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Everybody would like to make people <unk> .
But despite all these <unk> of work , there are several <unk> <unk> that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
And my talk today is mostly <unk> by these <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s true for <unk> who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it &apos;s <unk> that we are as <unk> as anybody .
The first of these <unk> is a <unk> , complexity <unk> .
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no <unk> word , because we <unk> it up to lots of different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could <unk> it , but in <unk> and <unk> , that &apos;s something that we need to be <unk> , and we will have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of what &apos;s <unk> .
The second <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy to his life or happy with his life .
And these are two very different <unk> , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
And the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> fact that we can &apos;t think about a <unk> that <unk> <unk> without <unk> his meaning .
I mean , this is a real <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s simply no way to get it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my <unk> who <unk> a story . &#91; <unk> ... &#93; He said he had a <unk> <unk> , and it was absolutely <unk> music , and at the end of the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then he <unk> <unk> , really quite <unk> , that <unk> the whole experience .
But it didn &apos;t .
What it <unk> was the <unk> of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
She didn &apos;t know because he was <unk> with a memory ; the memory was <unk> , and the memory was everything he had to <unk> .
What really tells us is that we might think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
There &apos;s a <unk> self living in the <unk> , and the <unk> knows the <unk> , <unk> the past , but essentially just the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; Are you going to be <unk> now if I &apos;m standing here ? &quot;
And then there &apos;s an <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that , the <unk> and the story of our life <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> that the doctor <unk> by asking the question , &quot; How have you <unk> in <unk> time ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your journey to <unk> ? &quot; or something like that .
These are two very different <unk> , <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two to <unk> is part of the <unk> of happiness .
Now , the <unk> self is a <unk> .
And that really starts with a <unk> response to our <unk> -- it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re trying to tell stories .
Our <unk> tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to <unk> from our <unk> is a story .
And let &apos;s start with one example .
There &apos;s an old study .
These are real patients , <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
I won &apos;t go into <unk> . She &apos;s not <unk> today , but she was <unk> when this study was done in the <unk> .
They were asked to <unk> every 60 seconds of their <unk> .
And here are two patients . These are their <unk> .
And you &apos;ll ask , &quot; Who one has more <unk> ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a very simple question .
<unk> <unk> has more <unk> . His <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that <unk> A had <unk> <unk> , and more .
But now there &apos;s a other question : &quot; How much did these patients think they <unk> ? &quot;
And here &apos;s a <unk> .
And the <unk> is that <unk> A a lot of <unk> <unk> was <unk> than <unk> <unk> .
The stories of <unk> were <unk> , and because a very <unk> part of the story is how they <unk> .
And none of these stories is very <unk> or <unk> -- but one of them is <unk> , but one of them is much worse than the other .
And the rate that was worse was where the pain was very close to his <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people for their <unk> , and they said , &quot; How <unk> was the whole thing <unk> ? &quot;
She was much worse for A than for <unk> in <unk> .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> between the future self and the future self .
From the <unk> self , <unk> had a great time .
Now , what you could do with <unk> A , and we actually did <unk> experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it works , you could actually <unk> the <unk> of <unk> A <unk> by simply <unk> the <unk> <unk> without <unk> it .
That will lead the <unk> <unk> , but only a bit , much less than before .
And if you do that for a few minutes , you have <unk> that the <unk> self <unk> from <unk> A <unk> is <unk> , and you have <unk> that the <unk> self of <unk> is a much better <unk> , because now you have <unk> A a better story about his experience .
What is a story about ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories that <unk> us , and it &apos;s true to the stories that we <unk> .
<unk> a story is <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very important , and in this case , the end is <unk> .
Well , the <unk> self lives lives .
It has <unk> of <unk> , one after another .
And you ask , what happens to these <unk> ?
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever .
I mean , most of our lives -- and I &apos;ve got the <unk> -- you know , the <unk> <unk> is true than about three seconds long , which means that in a life , there are about <unk> million of them . In a month , there &apos;s about <unk> . Most of them are not <unk> .
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk> self .
And yet , you sort of get the <unk> that they should be <unk> that what is our life during this <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> as we are in the world .
And as we <unk> it would be important , but it &apos;s not the story that <unk> the <unk> self for us .
So we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite <unk> .
The biggest difference between them is the <unk> of time .
From the <unk> self , if you have a <unk> , and the second week is just as good as the first one , the <unk> <unk> <unk> is as good as the <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t really work at all the future self .
For the <unk> self , a <unk> <unk> is <unk> better than the <unk> <unk> , because there &apos;s no new <unk> .
They didn &apos;t <unk> the story .
And in this way , time is actually the <unk> <unk> that an <unk> self <unk> from a <unk> self , very little influence on this story .
Now , the <unk> self is doing more than <unk> and telling stories .
It &apos;s actually a <unk> that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who has a patient , we &apos;ve had two <unk> at two different <unk> and <unk> what to <unk> , then the <unk> of who has the memory , which is less <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
The <unk> self has no voice in that <unk> .
In fact , we don &apos;t choose between <unk> . We choose between <unk> to <unk> .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as <unk> .
We think of our future as <unk> <unk> .
And essentially , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which sort of <unk> the <unk> self through experience that the <unk> self doesn &apos;t need .
I have the <unk> that when we make <unk> , it &apos;s very common , which means we make <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> self .
And that &apos;s a little bit hard to <unk> , I think .
I mean , how are we <unk> from our <unk> ?
This is one of the <unk> that &apos;s given for the <unk> of the <unk> self .
And when I think about it , I think of a <unk> that we did in the <unk> a few years ago , the <unk> of the best <unk> I had ever had , and I often think often in the <unk> about how often I think about other <unk> .
And I probably <unk> my <unk> to this <unk> journey , I would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I &apos;ve ever <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> images , I would have spent another hour .
Now , this is three weeks , and this is <unk> <unk> hours .
There seems to be a <unk> .
Now , I like to be a little <unk> , you know , how little <unk> I have on the <unk> of <unk> , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question : Why do we give <unk> so much weight in the <unk> to the weight we give <unk> ?
So I want you to think about a <unk> .
Imagine your next <unk> , you know , at the end of the <unk> , you &apos;re all going to be <unk> , and you get a <unk> so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
Now would you choose the same <unk> ? And if you would choose another <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this <unk> , and it &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you &apos;ll have an answer . And if you think of <unk> , you may have a different answer .
Why we <unk> the <unk> that we <unk> is a problem that <unk> us with a choice between the two species of self .
Well , the two species of self <unk> two <unk> of happiness .
There are actually two <unk> of happiness that we can <unk> , one per self .
So you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
And then you would ask , how happy are the <unk> in life &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness for <unk> is a pretty <unk> process .
What are the <unk> that can be <unk> ?
And , <unk> , we &apos;re now <unk> a pretty good idea of happiness of the <unk> self over time .
If you ask the <unk> of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
This is not about how happy a person is .
It &apos;s how <unk> or <unk> the person is , when this person <unk> about her life .
Very <unk> term .
<unk> who &apos;s not going to <unk> this <unk> is going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> to a lot of <unk> on <unk> that have <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> long .
The <unk> between the <unk> self and the <unk> of the <unk> self has been <unk> in the last few years , and now you &apos;re <unk> to measure the two <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> has an <unk> <unk> , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their <unk> , and there were other <unk> in the direction .
So in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of both these kinds of self .
And the <unk> <unk> that I think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really <unk> .
You can know how <unk> someone is with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really <unk> a lot of how happy he lives his life and <unk> .
Just to give you a sense of the <unk> , the <unk> is about <unk> .
What that means is that if you were meet someone , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
Well , you would know about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
They have so much <unk> .
If I tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight on a <unk> of 10 , you &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> about how happy he is to his <unk> self .
So the <unk> is <unk> .
We know something about what the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
We know that money is very important , <unk> are very important .
We know that happiness is <unk> to be <unk> with people we like to spend time with people we like .
There are other <unk> , but that &apos;s <unk> .
So if you want to <unk> the <unk> of the two types of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
The <unk> of what I said here is that we really don &apos;t really should be <unk> as a <unk> for <unk> .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Well , very short , another reason that we don &apos;t know clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
So if you ask the simple question , how happy people in California are not going to get the <unk> answer .
If you ask this question , you think that the people in California have to be <unk> if you , say , in <unk> .
And what happens is that when you think about life in California , think about the difference between California and other places , and that difference , we say , in <unk> .
Now , it turns out that <unk> is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that <unk> how happy people are .
Well , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can go to the end -- some people could go to California at the end .
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people that are <unk> to California to be <unk> .
Well , you &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
We know this .
But one thing is going to happen , you &apos;ll think they &apos;re <unk> , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be <unk> by how <unk> the <unk> was in <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> that they made the right decision .
It &apos;s very hard to think about <unk> , and I hope I have a sense of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris <unk> : Thank you . I have a question for you .
Thank you .
Now , when we started <unk> a couple of weeks ago , <unk> me that there was a pretty <unk> <unk> that came out of this <unk> .
Is that something that you can <unk> , because you &apos;ve <unk> a few minutes now ?
<unk> <unk> : <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve found in the <unk> <unk> is a number that we didn &apos;t really expect to find .
We found this in the <unk> of the <unk> self .
When we look at how <unk> <unk> .
And it turns out that under a <unk> of <unk> dollars a year , for Americans , and this is a very large <unk> of <unk> , about <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a big <unk> <unk> , under a <unk> income dollars a year .
CA : <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> dollars a year are <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And then we get a perfectly <unk> line .
I mean , I <unk> saw so <unk> <unk> .
What happens is obvious is that money is not a <unk> <unk> , but that <unk> <unk> of money is probably <unk> <unk> , and we can measure this <unk> very , very clearly .
In the spirit of the other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
The more money you are <unk> the <unk> .
That &apos;s not true for <unk> .
CA : But <unk> , the whole American <unk> is about life , freedom , the <unk> of <unk> .
If people take this <unk> seriously , I mean , it seems to put it all on the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
Is there a chance that there was a chance that the country was going to take a <unk> like <unk> and make it <unk> politics ?
<unk> : You know , I think there are <unk> to the role of <unk> in politics .
The <unk> is going to be slow in the United States , no question , but in the United <unk> , they &apos;re happening in and in other countries .
People are <unk> to think about <unk> when they think about politics .
It &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> , and people will <unk> whether they want to study <unk> , or if they want to study <unk> , so we need to have this <unk> very soon .
How you can <unk> happiness is very <unk> on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
This is going to affect politics , I think , in the <unk> .
In the United States , you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
That will , I think , in the next one or two <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
CA : Well , it seems to me , this <unk> , or should be the <unk> political <unk> for <unk> over the next few years .
Thank you for the <unk> of <unk> .
Thank you , <unk> <unk> .
Today , I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and <unk> .
And maybe something that may be surprised because my <unk> in the <unk> is <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the things that we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> to make the <unk> two billion a better life .
But energy and <unk> are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than for every other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> will not grow over many years , and we &apos;re too much <unk> , and things will change to how it can &apos;t <unk> their <unk> environment .
That leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> . It leads to <unk> .
So it &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> for them .
<unk> , it &apos;s very important for them .
In fact , if you could <unk> only one thing to the price , the <unk> would be energy at <unk> .
Well , the <unk> is over time .
In fact , <unk> is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and even in the <unk> century , there was a <unk> case in <unk> , and so we have <unk> , <unk> , we can make <unk> materials and do so many things .
So we are in a <unk> situation with electricity in the rich world .
But if we <unk> the price -- we let the price <unk> -- we make a new <unk> , and these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the planet , and the <unk> <unk> is really quite clear .
It <unk> the <unk> <unk> that goes to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> , and maybe worse , the <unk> that the natural <unk> can &apos;t <unk> such <unk> change and <unk> all the systems .
Now , the <unk> relationship between a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where the more <unk> are <unk> , there &apos;s some <unk> , but not very many .
And there are certain <unk> of how <unk> are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely <unk> .
I asked the <unk> <unk> , &quot; Are we really going down to <unk> ?
<unk> not half half or a <unk> ? &quot;
And the answer is , until we get close to <unk> , the <unk> will continue <unk> .
So it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different than to say , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that has to <unk> under a <unk> <unk> , and then you can <unk> <unk> .
So this one has to go down , <unk> .
Well , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> every year , over <unk> billion <unk> .
<unk> Americans are about 20 <unk> , people from <unk> countries , less than one .
In the <unk> , it &apos;s about five <unk> for everyone on the planet .
And somehow we have to <unk> change that are <unk> to <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> different <unk> changes have <unk> at all , and we need to go from <unk> <unk> to <unk> and to a <unk> to <unk> .
This <unk> has four <unk> . A little bit <unk> . You have this thing on the left -- <unk> -- that you want to bring it to the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> by the number of people , from the <unk> that every human being in the <unk> , the <unk> energy for every <unk> and the <unk> that will <unk> per <unk> .
So , let &apos;s look at every <unk> <unk> and see how we get it to <unk> .
<unk> , one of these numbers has to come very close to <unk> .
Now that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but let &apos;s go through it .
First of all , we have the population .
Today , <unk> billion people are living .
And it <unk> to <unk> billion <unk> that move on <unk> billion .
If we &apos;re very successful with new <unk> that might be <unk> and <unk> , we could probably <unk> that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a <unk> about <unk> .
The second <unk> is the <unk> we use .
That <unk> everything , the food we eat , <unk> , television , <unk> .
That &apos;s very good things , and <unk> means that these <unk> are almost to make it <unk> on the planet .
It &apos;s great that this number <unk> .
In the rich world , in the <unk> billion , we could be able to make <unk> and use less , but in the <unk> , this number every year will <unk> and <unk> more than <unk> , the number of <unk> <unk> per person .
Here we see a very <unk> <unk> . <unk> it home so you can read the <unk> ?
And these students don &apos;t have it , so they go and read their <unk> under their <unk> .
Well , at <unk> , the <unk> , the energy per <unk> , has finally got good news .
We have something that &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new <unk> in the <unk> , there are many <unk> <unk> that can <unk> you <unk> , <unk> <unk> can be <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> : <unk> : <unk> some <unk> <unk> by 90 percent .
Some individual <unk> <unk> by 90 percent .
In other <unk> , like the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , the <unk> for <unk> is very much smaller .
<unk> , if we &apos;re <unk> , maybe we get a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> or maybe a <unk> <unk> .
But in the first three decades , we &apos;ve gone from <unk> billion , maybe <unk> billion billion <unk> , and that &apos;s simply not enough .
So let &apos;s look at the <unk> <unk> -- and this will be a <unk> -- this is the amount of carbon <unk> per <unk> .
It <unk> the question of whether you can get that on <unk> .
<unk> : No .
<unk> : No .
<unk> every <unk> of electricity is <unk> , except the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So , what we need to do on a global <unk> is to create a new system .
We need <unk> .
Now , when I say the term &quot; <unk> , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the <unk> .
The <unk> is a <unk> . The <unk> is a <unk> .
The Internet and the <unk> is a <unk> .
People here have this <unk> of this wonder .
<unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> that you need to have a <unk> to a certain <unk> .
<unk> , you &apos;re just <unk> and some of them are coming , and some people don &apos;t .
But in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a <unk> in very <unk> time .
Now , I asked myself , how could I really <unk> this ?
Is there a natural <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> the idea of people here ?
I went to the last year when I got <unk> , and somehow people <unk> that .
So the idea became really <unk> for them , you know , there are people living with <unk> .
For energy , this is what <unk> me .
I decided the <unk> of <unk> would be my <unk> <unk> to the environment .
So here &apos;s some natural <unk> .
I told you they didn &apos;t <unk> , and in fact they don &apos;t even get the <unk> .
Well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
We need to have the solutions , either one or a half who have an <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and while there are many <unk> where people are looking for , I &apos;m really just five who can afford this great <unk> .
I have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , these might be a <unk> <unk> , and if they give me <unk> than I <unk> , that would be great , but my <unk> here is that we have to work on all these <unk> five , and we can &apos;t <unk> them from them because they &apos;re <unk> to us , because everybody have <unk> problems .
Let &apos;s first look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> by either <unk> or <unk> .
What you have to do there is perhaps simple , but it &apos;s not . You have to <unk> all the <unk> that comes out of the <unk> after the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> under pressure , and then <unk> somewhere and hope that it <unk> there .
There are some <unk> that can <unk> that in a 60 percent -- 80 percent <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> to 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is <unk> .
Who will <unk> it ?
Who can <unk> something , which literally many billion times greater than any kind of <unk> that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
That &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
So this is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
They also have three big problems : the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human <unk> that the <unk> is not used for weapons .
And then what do you do with the <unk> ?
Because while it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
People have to feel good . <unk> <unk> : 10 , <unk> . <unk> : 10 , <unk> three very <unk> problems that might be <unk> .
So three very <unk> problems that might be <unk> , and that &apos;s why you should be working on .
I <unk> the last three of five .
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , as they &apos;re called <unk> .
And also , although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need <unk> -- they have some <unk> .
One is the <unk> that these technologies create more <unk> than <unk> .
These are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , <unk> more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> .
And then these <unk> <unk> .
The sun doesn &apos;t seem like it all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> every day , but it doesn &apos;t seem like the wind <unk> all the time .
That &apos;s why you have to , if you &apos;re <unk> out of these <unk> , you have to have a way to get the energy in times when you &apos;re not <unk> .
So there &apos;s big <unk> here . There are challenges in <unk> , and if we say <unk> that <unk> is outside the country , you don &apos;t need to only need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of the energy from where different <unk> .
And there &apos;s the <unk> .
And to show the <unk> , I <unk> all the kinds of <unk> that are made , <unk> : the <unk> of cars , computers , <unk> , <unk> , for everything . And that &apos;s me with the amount of dark energy that uses the world , <unk> , and I found that all the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> are less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
So we need a big <unk> here , something that will be 100 better than the <unk> of the time .
That &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
That &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re trying to <unk> this <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> .
If you want to look at 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
Now , where are we going to go : What is the right approach ?
A &quot; <unk> project &quot; ? How do we get to the goal ?
What we need is many companies working on it . <unk> .
In each of these five <unk> , we need at least 100 people .
So many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! That &apos;s good .
I think there are many people in the TED group who are already <unk> .
Bill <unk> has several companies , including one called the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies and interesting <unk> and I try to support that .
<unk> <unk> and I <unk> a company who might <unk> , <unk> the <unk> approach .
There are some <unk> in <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> has <unk> in this <unk> recently <unk> , so it &apos;s not a big <unk> that some good <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> means that you <unk> <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to <unk> the <unk> percent , the <unk> .
That &apos;s a pretty <unk> idea .
But in fact , you &apos;ve had long <unk> about it long , but you couldn &apos;t <unk> <unk> if it would work , but if there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> and see that , yes ! With the right <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s <unk> .
And because you <unk> that <unk> percent , it &apos;s much better .
In fact , you <unk> the <unk> , and you can even use the <unk> of today &apos;s <unk> as <unk> .
<unk> about your head , <unk> it . A great thing .
The <unk> is <unk> <unk> , a bit like a <unk> .
You can see it &apos;s kind of a <unk> , often called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> really <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture of a <unk> in <unk> .
This is the <unk> , the <unk> percent . You have the part that &apos;s <unk> today , so it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> the <unk> for hundreds of years .
And when you <unk> <unk> and simply <unk> , you get <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of the planet .
You know , there are many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many <unk> of <unk> that we need to get <unk> .
Let &apos;s talk about how we should measure our success .
What should our <unk> look like ?
Now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
A lot of people are talking about <unk> to <unk> .
It &apos;s really important to get there .
The <unk> 20 percent will be produced in <unk> countries , and still some agriculture , and the <unk> will be <unk> and <unk> until the <unk> .
So , in order to achieve this 80 percent , the <unk> , <unk> countries like China , their <unk> completely <unk> .
The other <unk> says whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s <unk> in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the path of getting them to the rest .
That &apos;s <unk> important .
That will be a <unk> of this <unk> .
If we were out there , what should the <unk> <unk> look like ?
It should <unk> the two <unk> .
We should use the <unk> to get <unk> on the path , the less we <unk> , the more <unk> will be the <unk> and also the <unk> .
But in fact , this <unk> for the things that we &apos;re <unk> , which we &apos;re not completely <unk> to the big <unk> , just the same , or even a little bit less important as the other that <unk> the <unk> of innovation for these <unk> .
And we have to track this <unk> with <unk> , and we can measure that , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of great books about this <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> book , &quot; We have a choice &quot; and David <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
They &apos;re actually going through and create a <unk> where this can be <unk> , because we need to support support of all <unk> .
There is <unk> that needs to <unk> .
That &apos;s a wish .
A very powerful wish that we <unk> this technology .
If you give me a wish for the next 50 years , I could <unk> the <unk> , a <unk> , and I love that , or I could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without <unk> , I <unk> that wish .
This has the largest <unk> .
If we &apos;re not <unk> this wish , the <unk> is going to be <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk> people , between the United States and China , between <unk> and rich and almost every life of two billion are very much <unk> .
So what do we have to do ?
And what <unk> I <unk> ?
We have to use for more <unk> .
If countries are <unk> in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about <unk> .
You should <unk> these <unk> , and you would be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> who are <unk> for these <unk> <unk> .
We need <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> something that makes a <unk> .
We have to spread the message .
We need to have <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also the things that are <unk> by government .
It &apos;s an important wish , but I think we can <unk> it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris <unk> : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Just to understand something better -- <unk> , can you give us an idea of <unk> of these <unk> ?
Bill <unk> : In order to get the <unk> on a <unk> , to get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . And even if we put our materials in a <unk> <unk> to make sure it works <unk> , it &apos;s just in the <unk> million .
The <unk> step is the <unk> of the first <unk> to find more billion , the <unk> , and the place that actually <unk> the first of it .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> , if it <unk> like <unk> , it &apos;s all clear , because the <unk> , the <unk> , is so different from <unk> as we know it .
CA : So to understand that really , this means deep in the ground almost like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , and then the process starts moving up , and they &apos;re going to <unk> down ?
<unk> : Right . Now , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> always , so there are many people and lots of <unk> who can go out and <unk> it , and things like that , and stuff <unk> or <unk> . It &apos;s not good !
But if you have very <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a <unk> -- which <unk> you without the whole <unk> .
And it &apos;s sitting there and it <unk> for 60 years , and it &apos;s done .
CA : A <unk> who <unk> a solution to the <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . Now , what happens with the <unk> : You can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less <unk> with this <unk> -- then you take it and you put it in the next <unk> and <unk> it .
And we &apos;re starting by <unk> the <unk> that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> . That &apos;s our <unk> .
So what was a problem for this <unk> , what we did in our <unk> , and that will be the <unk> <unk> <unk> during this <unk> .
CA : But while you &apos;ve been talking about different people in the world about this <unk> .
Where is the most <unk> interest , what really <unk> ?
<unk> : Well , we haven &apos;t yet to go to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> for everything that &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; in the name . There &apos;s big interest , and the people of the <unk> were in <unk> , India , China -- I was here , and I talked to the <unk> , and I talked about how it <unk> to the <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> . You know , the <unk> and <unk> have something in the direction .
This is a <unk> of a thing that was made .
This is a very important step , but it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> , and some countries have built this , so anybody who <unk> a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> for our first .
CA : In your imagination , <unk> and <unk> are something like that in life ?
<unk> : So we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very <unk> , we spent 20 years to <unk> and then 20 years to <unk> .
This is <unk> the <unk> that <unk> us the <unk> that we have to <unk> .
And , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , and it &apos;s a big wish , it might be easy .
And <unk> , there are <unk> of companies today , and we need <unk> who , as if their <unk> work , <unk> the <unk> for their <unk> .
And it would be <unk> if they do multiple , because then you could use a <unk> .
<unk> , we need a solution .
CA : <unk> of the great possible <unk> , is that the <unk> you know ?
<unk> : A <unk> is the <unk> .
It would have been without the <unk> , but it does so much more important .
In the <unk> <unk> , there are other <unk> companies .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe it &apos;s telling us .
And so , there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a <unk> is going to have a million times as much energy as a , say , a <unk> , and so , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and the cost , <unk> the <unk> , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in your <unk> .
CA : If that didn &apos;t work , what then ?
<unk> we <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : When you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you have too much <unk> , and <unk> in front of a <unk> . So what do you do ? You might need a <unk> or a <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which <unk> with different <unk> to <unk> the <unk> , so we <unk> 20 or 30 years to <unk> .
This is just one <unk> .
You know we don &apos;t need it .
Some people say , well , you don &apos;t want to be working on the <unk> , because you might go out and get <unk> , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if the <unk> is , if you look at the <unk> of this <unk> , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> about whether you should have that , if things come faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
CA : <unk> : Do you have one or two <unk> for <unk> to <unk> you ?
<unk> : Well , unfortunately , the <unk> live in very different <unk> .
<unk> that make science <unk> are very little .
Did they say there are <unk> effects that have to do with the <unk> that <unk> things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even tell , that there is a chance in a million .
The <unk> here is similar to AIDS .
You do the <unk> now , and you <unk> a lot later .
And so , the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of <unk> problems to invest in something you &apos;ve just got to do about what has happened -- and to do that , the <unk> is not so clear . In fact , the <unk> is not necessarily <unk> the <unk> , and there are people in the rich world that look at <unk> and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big <unk> .
The fact is that these <unk> should worry about us .
But my dream here is that , if you can make it <unk> , and at the same time , the <unk> <unk> , then the <unk> say , &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t really care that it doesn &apos;t <unk> <unk> , I almost <unk> it , because it &apos;s <unk> than the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
CA : And that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that if you use all of that time and energy to solve the <unk> problem , all the other <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> and so forth that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of resources to invest money for better things we can do .
<unk> : Well , the <unk> <unk> for the research -- let &apos;s say that <unk> should be 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not that <unk> .
<unk> should not <unk> other things .
You get to big <unk> , and here you can get <unk> people , if you have something that &apos;s not <unk> , and trying to <unk> it , and for me , here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> in front of a <unk> , and just <unk> the <unk> , I think we should try more things that have the potential to be much more <unk> .
If the <unk> you get is a very <unk> <unk> , you can only <unk> the <unk> .
I mean , every one of us here could <unk> five times so much for our energy without changing his <unk> .
For the <unk> two billion , it &apos;s a <unk> .
And even <unk> thinks about it .
The new <unk> is , &quot; Why is it that <unk> <unk> is not going to <unk> more ? &quot;
It will still be , because of his <unk> stories , with the <unk> <unk> , but he has understood that that &apos;s a very <unk> group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s <unk> the <unk> now .
And this is a <unk> that I consider for <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it will be <unk> .
CA : Bill , I think I &apos;m speaking for almost every person here , when I say , I really hope your wish will be true . Thank you so much .
<unk> : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you something a few months ago on a <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
I always <unk> my <unk> , but I was done with the <unk> of the <unk> , and I noticed that I had never <unk> in my life , which means &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;ll tell you the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : <unk> , strong , <unk> . &quot;
I <unk> this list of a friend of <unk> <unk> , and I had to <unk> <unk> , it was so <unk> , but I got only to <unk> , and I couldn &apos;t go back to it , and I had to stop reading , and then <unk> <unk> for this <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Of course , this was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I just thought that the <unk> must be pretty old .
But in fact , it was a <unk> in the early &apos; <unk> , when I was working on the <unk> <unk> and I started <unk> my <unk> outside my <unk> and <unk> in terms of other kids and the <unk> world around me .
And thank God , I didn &apos;t use a <unk> at that time .
<unk> I take this <unk> seriously , I was born into a world that would <unk> someone like me as a person who could <unk> life in a <unk> way , but today but I am going to <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> I have <unk> .
So I immediately <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and I expect me to find a <unk> here .
Here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s not much better .
<unk> , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
But it &apos;s not just the words .
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these <unk> .
It &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we <unk> these values .
Our language <unk> our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
Many <unk> societies , including the <unk> and the <unk> , have really <unk> that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big force , because what you can <unk> <unk> is also <unk> .
So what do we actually want to <unk> -- a <unk> person or a <unk> person ?
Instead of having a human being <unk> as a child , <unk> might <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> them .
<unk> &apos;t it be <unk> to open you <unk> ?
A person who &apos;s been <unk> for me <unk> was my <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
He &apos;s called Dr. <unk> . A <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most Americans couldn &apos;t <unk> <unk> . So he was always called Dr. <unk> .
And Dr. <unk> <unk> was always very <unk> and was just <unk> for children like this .
I found the time I spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my <unk> .
I had to <unk> the single <unk> <unk> <unk> often with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that &apos;s what you know to build my <unk> , and I have these <unk> more <unk> than everything else . I <unk> them . I <unk> them .
And imagine , I &apos;ve been <unk> as a young child with Dr. <unk> , and so trying to <unk> this <unk> , <unk> without success .
And one day , he was watching me at one of my <unk> -- these <unk> were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re such a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> girl , you &apos;ll be one day of this <unk> <unk> .
And if you get it , I &apos;ll give you about <unk> dollars . &quot;
This was , of course , a simple <unk> of Dr. <unk> , so I make the <unk> that I didn &apos;t want to do , with the <unk> that <unk> <unk> girls are in the <unk> in the second <unk> , but he actually brought me to see my <unk> <unk> with new eyes , and that &apos;s how it became a new and <unk> <unk> .
And I wonder how much his vision of me as <unk> and <unk> <unk> girl has <unk> my <unk> , and I could imagine as one of nature from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> person .
This is just one example of many , like <unk> in <unk> , can <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> .
But like most <unk> examples from the <unk> <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t have a room to <unk> something that we would all <unk> to : it will be <unk> to each other , to see themselves as <unk> people .
Our language <unk> the <unk> changes that have been <unk> by a <unk> change in many cases .
Of course , <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> bodies that allow people to really use their <unk> and <unk> across the <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> <unk> to develop , not to speak of <unk> <unk> <unk> , people can give themselves to be their own identity , to <unk> in their own way , in their own way ,
And it &apos;s moving to groups around the world that they <unk> themselves .
So , maybe <unk> this <unk> change , because the fact that there was a different truth , which is that every person in society can <unk> something quite <unk> and very <unk> , and that the human ability to <unk> , our <unk> <unk> .
The human ability to <unk> -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always always ask me to tell me about how I <unk> with <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you something : this sentence has never been <unk> to me , and I &apos;ve always been very <unk> to <unk> the questions of people , and I think <unk> <unk> me why .
This sentence from the <unk> with <unk> lives with the idea that success or <unk> of <unk> <unk> a challenge without being <unk> with <unk> <unk> , as if my life would be so successful , because I could <unk> the possible <unk> of a life with a <unk> , or whatever people are <unk> me with my <unk> .
But the truth is that we change . Of course , we are <unk> by the challenge , whether it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> or even <unk> .
And I <unk> that this is good .
<unk> are not <unk> that we have to <unk> to get better with our lives .
<unk> are simple to our lives .
And I <unk> to see <unk> as my <unk> .
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very <unk> , sometimes it &apos;s not to see it , but it &apos;s constantly with me .
And I want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a human being .
There are <unk> in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re just <unk> , and each person is different about it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re getting <unk> with <unk> or not , but how we get it .
So we are not just responsible for the people we love to <unk> <unk> , but they also <unk> to get good .
And we don &apos;t teach our kids to <unk> if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t <unk> .
You have to <unk> two things : to one of the medical fact , to be <unk> , and to the other , the <unk> <unk> of whether I am <unk> or not .
And to be honest , the only <unk> and <unk> <unk> that I had to <unk> with , is that the world is constantly <unk> , <unk> me with these <unk> .
In our desire to protect people who are on the heart , and to give them the <unk> , <unk> truth about their medical <unk> , or even <unk> a <unk> for <unk> that they &apos;re <unk> to do , we have to <unk> that we don &apos;t have the <unk> to be <unk> .
Maybe the <unk> concept is just <unk> to what &apos;s in a <unk> , and how we <unk> it , for each one of them as the <unk> .
When we don &apos;t treat a human <unk> , and not all of his forces and <unk> and <unk> , we create <unk> to the natural <unk> that they might have to lead , another disease .
We <unk> a person who has a value for our society .
So we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the <unk> of human <unk> .
But what &apos;s interesting about <unk> is that , between the <unk> of our <unk> and our <unk> <unk> , there is a connection .
We should not <unk> those <unk> times or <unk> , we should not try to <unk> them , we should be <unk> them under the <unk> , but it &apos;s about <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
I think it may be more likely to <unk> that we don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to <unk> them , <unk> them at the <unk> <unk> , to use a <unk> and maybe even <unk> with it .
And maybe we &apos;ll be able to see <unk> as something more <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and don &apos;t feel so through their <unk> .
In this year , we <unk> the 200 . <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when he wrote about evolution <unk> years ago , <unk> , in my view , <unk> on something very <unk> in the human <unk> .
I would <unk> it : not the <unk> of his kind of <unk> , and not the <unk> of its kind , but the one that can change change in the best <unk> .
<unk> <unk> creativity .
Not just from <unk> <unk> , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , from the <unk> of human <unk> , <unk> by <unk> .
So , <unk> , change and <unk> are the <unk> <unk> of the people .
And maybe we just know that we &apos;re <unk> from <unk> when we really become <unk> .
<unk> is exactly the sense of <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , a sense of our own <unk> .
We can do something like this .
We can make a new meaning that goes beyond <unk> times .
Maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> , for a change that we haven &apos;t been involved in .
I think the biggest <unk> we &apos;ve <unk> ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
<unk> , who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no <unk> .
There &apos;s the <unk> . That &apos;s the <unk> . But not the <unk> . And would you really want to know this <unk> , <unk> person , if it really <unk> ?
I don &apos;t think so much .
It would be great if we <unk> this <unk> of <unk> against a different <unk> or <unk> , to even <unk> it a little bit more <unk> , more <unk> , so we can <unk> the forces of very many children and <unk> them to <unk> their very <unk> and <unk> skills to society .
<unk> have found out that humans from the <unk> of our society always have an <unk> : <unk> and <unk> a <unk> .
There &apos;s evidence that the <unk> <unk> , <unk> years ago , people and people with <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and that might happen because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people were <unk> for society .
They didn &apos;t look at these people as <unk> and <unk> ; they were treated as something <unk> and <unk> .
A few years ago , I went to the city where I was <unk> in a <unk> in <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the <unk> of <unk> , and I was standing there in front of a <unk> .
It was summer , and I had <unk> .
And I <unk> the guy behind me , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not enough <unk> . &quot;
And I sat around and see this <unk> man . I had no idea who he is .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , do you know ? I can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , you <unk> &apos;t remember me .
When I saw you , I <unk> you from the <unk> of your mother . &quot;
Oh , yeah .
And of course , then it did <unk> .
This was Dr. <unk> , a man I just <unk> out of my mother &apos;s <unk> on this day , because I , of course , <unk> , <unk> two weeks to <unk> .
The doctor for <unk> <unk> was in <unk> , and so my parents <unk> the man who brought me to the world at all .
And because I was born without <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> after them , and I just had some <unk> on this , and some <unk> at the other foot , he was the <unk> , this <unk> had to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
He said to me , &quot; I &apos;ve had to say <unk> parents that you never walk , and never <unk> as <unk> as other children , or you &apos;ve never got a <unk> life , and you &apos;ve just got me <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , I found that he <unk> <unk> of my entire childhood , no matter whether I was <unk> at a <unk> in the second <unk> , whether I was <unk> with the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , no matter whether I had <unk> my <unk> or one of my <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> these <unk> to <unk> his students from the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And he called that part of his <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the human <unk> .
It &apos;s simply not enough how <unk> this <unk> can be for people &apos;s <unk> .
And Dr. <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; I &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t say something else , and also when they get a little bit of support , when you <unk> kids , then kids can achieve much . &quot;
You see , Dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
He had understood that the medical <unk> <unk> and how someone <unk> with it , two different things .
And also , I was <unk> my thinking at the <unk> of time , if they asked me at the age 15 years , whether I would have <unk> my <unk> against legs from <unk> and <unk> , I would have no second <unk> .
I didn &apos;t want to <unk> normal at the time .
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And that &apos;s what happened , I &apos;ve seen something with my <unk> , and not <unk> of this <unk> .
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;m so many people who have <unk> me <unk> , rather than <unk> people who wanted me to <unk> me or give me an idea .
You see , it &apos;s really just a person to tell you how to <unk> your forces , and you are through .
If you allow someone to <unk> your own , <unk> forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a <unk> moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for those people .
They bring them to <unk> themselves .
The <unk> meaning of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It means something that &apos;s in a <unk> , which is <unk> .
<unk> : So what are we going to do ?
In the <unk> years , in <unk> , they did a <unk> , and they <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
They call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the United States , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> are <unk> to <unk> .
And the A student will <unk> <unk> <unk> , the better teachers and so on .
They then have a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a &quot; <unk> &quot; the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; they said they were very <unk> , and after those three months , she really wrote <unk> .
And of course , it <unk> to hear the heart that <unk> said the <unk> , they were just <unk> .
And then it was like three months .
But only those who were still in school -- <unk> by the <unk> that the school had <unk> .
What was interesting about this study was that teachers weren &apos;t <unk> .
<unk> didn &apos;t know something was <unk> .
They were simply told that they were the <unk> , and they are the students with the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re the same as they were treated with them and they <unk> them .
The only <unk> <unk> is a <unk> mind that was <unk> , has no hope . He <unk> nothing more <unk> to <unk> our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to <unk> .
But if we create the human mind to <unk> , <unk> and other people around themselves to find beautiful , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> our forces to really <unk> .
If a spirit <unk> about these <unk> , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
I &apos;d like to <unk> with a <unk> that was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> named <unk> in the <unk> century , and I was told by my friend <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> is called &quot; The God who <unk> only four words . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> knows God , not the <unk> of the name , not the God of <unk> , but the God who <unk> only four words , but the God who only <unk> up only four words , and he just says , &quot; <unk> , <unk> with me . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> with me . Thank you .
