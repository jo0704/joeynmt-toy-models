A few years ago, here at TED, <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> called "The <unk>."
The idea is quite simple. <unk> have to <unk> the <unk> structure with 20 <unk>, about <unk> <unk>, about <unk> <unk> and a <unk>.
The <unk> needs to be <unk> up.
And while it seems really simple, it's actually really hard because people <unk> <unk> very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea, and I put it into a <unk>.
It was a great success.
I've done about 70 <unk> in the world, with students, <unk> and <unk>, even with <unk> <unk>, and there's something about this task, which <unk> <unk> <unk> into nature's <unk>, and I want to share some of it with you.
<unk>, most people start <unk> the task.
They talk about it. They talk about what it looks like, it <unk> for power.
And then you spend a little time in <unk> and organization. They <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
They spend a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And finally, just before they don't have time, somebody takes the <unk>, and they put it on top of the top, <unk> a step back and "<unk>," she <unk> her work.
But then what happened is, almost always, the "<unk>" to a "<unk>," because the weight of the <unk> <unk> that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk>.
There's a series of people who have much more <unk> <unk> than others, and under the <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
They <unk>, they <unk>, they're <unk>, they create <unk> <unk>.
And of course, there are <unk> who have much more <unk> <unk> and under the <unk> are <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And that's pretty amazing.
As <unk> <unk>, they <unk> not only the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> structures of all.
What they might be asking is, what is this? Why? What about those?
And <unk> said, "<unk> of the children <unk> to be <unk> of the <unk> <unk>."
They don't invest in <unk>.
But there's another reason.
And that was that <unk> were <unk> to find a <unk> plan.
And then <unk> him.
What happens when they put the <unk> on the top, they don't have time and what happens?
It's a crisis.
<unk> <unk>, what?
What <unk> is doing is they start to <unk> and build <unk>, <unk> <unk>, always with the <unk> at the top, so that they have the opportunity to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
And with each trial, the kids are going to get <unk> <unk> and not.
So the <unk> of working with <unk> is <unk>, but let's see how <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> for most <unk>, <unk>, half of them are, <unk> a little more, but not much, <unk> are better than the <unk>.
Who's the <unk>?
<unk> and <unk>, for happiness.
<unk> is what I've seen.
And why? Because they understand <unk> and <unk> <unk> patterns are the key to build <unk> structures.
<unk> is something about <unk>. But this is where it's interesting.
If you have a <unk> <unk> on the team, they become better.
It's incredible. They look around and see, "This team will win."
You can <unk> this. Why is that?
Because they have <unk> <unk> skills.
They <unk> the process, they understand it.
And <unk> team, <unk> and <unk> to work is going to improve the performance of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and their <unk> lead to success.
If you have 10 <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, you get about six, the <unk> structures.
I was trying to do something like this.
And I thought, well, let's get the <unk> out.
So I made a $<unk> cost of software for the <unk>.
What do you think about that <unk>?
What was the result?
This is what happened. Not a team had a <unk> structure.
If <unk> had built a <unk> high <unk>, he would have <unk> the price home.
So isn't it interesting that high <unk> have a <unk> <unk>?
We <unk> this <unk> with <unk> students.
What do you think about?
Now, <unk> the advantage of the <unk>.
So, from <unk>, <unk> 's team was under the best.
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> time.
So we have <unk> <unk> for us, <unk> nature and success.
You might ask: Why would someone actually spend a <unk> to <unk> a <unk>?
And the reason is, I use <unk> tools and <unk> to help <unk>, cars, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And what the <unk> does is she helps them <unk> <unk>.
Because <unk> said, every project has its own <unk>.
The challenge is an <unk> experience, a <unk> language <unk> <unk> to build the right <unk>.
And this is the value of this experience, this as simple <unk>.
And those of you who are interested in are <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk>, where you see the <unk> <unk>.
There's a <unk> there.
They find <unk> examples from around the world, how people <unk> the system and <unk>.
There's also <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk>, I think, is that the <unk> is actually a <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> that we are all <unk> our <unk> to the task, and that we use our thinking to <unk> how our <unk> and our <unk>, in the challenge that <unk> us.
And sometimes a little <unk> of this experience everything it takes to bring us from a "<unk>" -- to a "<unk>" to a <unk>.
And that can make a big difference.
Thank you.
So let's think that we have a machine.
A big machine, a <unk>, <unk> machine, and that's a <unk>.
And everyone in this room has to do it.
And you can go to the past, you can go to the future; you can't stay in here.
And I wonder what you would choose because I've asked my friends in a lot of times, and they wanted to go to the past.
I don't know. They wanted to go back to time before there was cars or <unk> or "America <unk> the <unk>."
I don't know.
I believe that you're sort of the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> that.
I'm not part of that group, I have to say.
I don't want to be in the past, not because I'm a <unk>.
It's because <unk> don't go back on this planet, they go <unk>.
So I want to get into this machine, and I want to go to the future.
This is the <unk> time ever ever on this planet, no matter what <unk> you <unk>: health, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There was never a time like this.
My <unk> <unk> everybody when they were 60.
My <unk> <unk> this number to <unk>.
My parents are the 80 in the <unk>.
So there should be a lot of nine at the beginning of my <unk>.
But it's not about people like us, because this is a bigger thing than that.
A child living in <unk> will expect to live as long as the <unk> man in the world 100 years ago.
Think about it. That's an incredible fact.
And why is that?
The <unk>. The <unk> have killed billions of people on this planet.
They have <unk> the <unk> of the Earth in a way that no one has ever done.
They're gone. They're <unk>.
We <unk> them. <unk>.
In the rich world, <unk> that millions of us have <unk> a generation of a generation, not yet.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>...
Do you know anybody who has this?
<unk>, <unk> medicine, our ability to <unk> billions of people, they're <unk> of the scientific <unk>.
And from my view, the scientific <unk>, things <unk>, see if it works, it's going to change, if it doesn't do it, one of the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
So that's the good news.
Now, <unk> is all the good news, because there are a bunch of other problems, and they're often <unk>.
And one of them is that, despite all of our <unk> a billion people on the world every day will go to <unk>.
That number <unk>, and it <unk> very fast, and that's <unk>.
And not only that, we've used our <unk> to <unk> this world.
<unk>, <unk> land, <unk>, oil, <unk> -- you're <unk>, and it's soon soon, and if we don't get out of that <unk> <unk>.
So the question is, can we do that? I think.
I think it's clear that we can produce food that will <unk> billions of people without <unk> the country they live on.
I think we can <unk> this world with energy that they don't <unk> at the same time.
I really believe that, and no, that's not a <unk>.
But this is what <unk> me <unk> -- one of the things that <unk> me to be <unk> about. We've never got scientific progress as <unk> as we can now.
And we have never been able to <unk> it as well as we can.
We're on the <unk> to <unk>, <unk> <unk> on many <unk>, and yet I really think that we're going to go back and take over 300 years before the <unk> to find a time in which we have <unk> progress, where we have <unk> about these things <unk>, more <unk> than now.
People are <unk> in their belief, so <unk> you can't <unk> them.
Not even the truth is <unk>.
And you know, everybody has a right to his <unk>; even a right to your mind.
But you know what you're not right?
They don't have a right to their own facts. '"<unk>, don't have it.
And I <unk> a <unk> to find that.
<unk> a decade ago, I wrote an article about <unk> for "The New <unk>," a little article.
And I was <unk> to <unk> on <unk>, on <unk> to what at the end of the most <unk> <unk> in the history of humanity.
I didn't know what I was supposed to do, so I just did what I was doing, I wrote a <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And soon, I wrote an article about <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The same thing, just bigger.
People <unk> crazy.
So I wrote a paper about this, and I couldn't understand why people thought that would be "<unk>," why they <unk> that molecules <unk> in a certain kind of a <unk> kind of <unk> to the <unk> of nature.
But you know, I do what I do. I wrote the article, I went on.
I mean, I'm <unk>.
We <unk>, we <unk>, we're eating, that's okay.
But this article <unk> me, and I couldn't figure out why, and finally I found it out.
And that's because these <unk> that were <unk> to me were not <unk> at all.
These were <unk> people, <unk> people, <unk> people.
They were just like the people in this room.
And that made me so <unk>.
But then I thought, you know what, we're honest.
We are at a point where we don't have the <unk> <unk> of progress as it used to be.
We talk about it.
We're talking about <unk> with small <unk>: "<unk>."
Okay, so there's reasons for that, and I think we know what reasons that is.
We have the trust in institutions, in <unk>, and sometimes <unk> in science, and there's no reason why this should not be.
You can just call a few names, and people will understand.
<unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
I mean, you know, you can choose your own list.
There are questions and problems with the people that we feel that they're always right. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> questions, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You don't have to take any <unk>.
But here's: If you get <unk>, you have to <unk> these <unk>, and we're not good at that.
And I can do that because now we are now in a <unk> of <unk>, as I've never seen, and hopefully I will never see again.
<unk> 12 years ago, a story came published, a <unk> story, <unk> the <unk> with the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Very <unk>.
<unk> studies were <unk> to see if that was <unk>.
<unk> studies should be done; this is a <unk> <unk>.
The data came in.
The data came from the United States, from England, from <unk>, from <unk>, and they were all the same, no <unk>, no connection, no <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference. It doesn't make any difference, because we believe in <unk>, we think what we see, what we think we can see, what <unk> that we really feel.
We don't believe in a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> that gives us data, and I understand that, I think we all do that.
But you know what?
The result of that was <unk>.
<unk> for this fact, the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is <unk> for <unk>.
That's <unk>, and we should be <unk>.
It's <unk>.
What happened we could do that.
Well, I <unk> that. I do that.
Because has someone <unk> here?
<unk> a <unk> in the audience who see somebody in <unk> die?
<unk> not very often.
<unk> in this country, not at all, but <unk> time in the world last year.
That's a lot of <unk> by <unk>, 20 per hour.
But because this is not happening here, we can <unk> it, and people like <unk> <unk> can be <unk> and <unk> by fear and <unk> of <unk> like <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they can do it because they don't <unk> and <unk>.
They don't understand that these things seem to be the same, but almost never <unk>.
And that's something that we need to learn, and very quickly.
This guy was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> us from one of the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
No fear, no <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The guy in the middle is not so much.
It's called Paul <unk>.
He's just developed a <unk> with a few other people.
It can save lives of <unk>, <unk> children a year in the developing world.
<unk> good, not?
Now, that's good, except that Paul <unk> talks about and say how <unk> they are, and that people are simply <unk> to <unk>.
And that's actually what he says.
So Paul is a <unk>.
When Paul <unk> in a public <unk>, he can't <unk> without any <unk>.
He gets <unk> at home, because people like to tell him they know where his children go to school.
And why? Because Paul has a <unk>.
I don't need to say that, but <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> them <unk>, <unk> the <unk>, <unk> disease, and that's happening.
We have now <unk> in this country now.
And that gets worse, and pretty soon, kids are going to die again because that's just a question of numbers.
And they're not just going to die of <unk>.
What about <unk>? <unk> this. Why not?
A friend of mine told me a couple of weeks ago, and I said I was a little bit <unk>.
No one has ever said this before.
She would not <unk> her child against <unk>. <unk> not.
<unk>.
Why? Because we don't have <unk>. And you know what?
We had no <unk> in this country.
Today, I don't know, maybe <unk> <unk> in <unk> in a plane, and he's just <unk> <unk>, right now, he's over <unk>.
And in a few hours, he <unk> and <unk> a car, and he comes to <unk> <unk>, and he's going to <unk> one of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And he doesn't know that he's <unk> with a <unk> disease, and we don't know, because that's the way the world works.
This is the <unk> that we live on. Don't <unk> like it's not.
We love to <unk> ourselves in <unk>. We love that.
Do you have all your <unk> today?
<unk>, a little <unk> that <unk> you to the <unk>.
I know you did it because half of the Americans are doing it every day.
They take this stuff, and they take <unk> <unk>, and it doesn't matter how often we find it <unk>.
The data <unk> it all the time.
You <unk> your <unk>. They almost never.
That's okay, you'd like to <unk> <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> you completely.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Now, I think I <unk> -- we <unk> the <unk>.
We <unk> a strong government. We have no trust in the system.
And we shouldn't. Our <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's absolutely amazing <unk> and <unk> to us who can afford it.
So we are walking away, and where do we walk?
We walk in the <unk> of the <unk>.
This is <unk>. I love the <unk>.
But you know, this is a <unk> <unk>, because this stuff is <unk>, and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all kinds of little <unk> here.
<unk> of it -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, I don't even know what that is, but we spend billions of dollars for it, it's <unk>.
And you know what? When I say that, people <unk> me and say, "What's it <unk>? <unk> people do what they want.
That's what they feel good. "
And you know what? They have <unk>.
Because it doesn't matter if it's the <unk> saying, "<unk>, I'm going to <unk> the <unk> of my <unk> to <unk>," or <unk> <unk>, who wants to treat his patients with <unk>.
If you go to this path where <unk> and <unk> <unk> and science <unk>, you get to a place where you don't want to be.
They go to <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> his people because he <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are much more <unk> than <unk> drugs that we know that they can <unk> the <unk> of AIDS.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a country that is worse than any other of this disease.
Don't tell me that these things have no <unk>.
They have them. They always have it.
Now, the <unk> <unk> that we are right now is this <unk> struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>. She has to stop.
It's a <unk> about words, over <unk>.
That's <unk>, not science.
Everything we eat, every <unk>, every <unk>, every <unk>, has changed by the people.
You know, there was no <unk> in <unk>.
There was no <unk>. There was no <unk>. We did all this.
We've done it in the last <unk> years.
And <unk> has worked and <unk> not.
We're <unk>, which doesn't work.
Now we can <unk> it. And of course, there's <unk>. But we can do something like <unk> A in <unk>, and that stuff can help millions of people to <unk> millions of people to <unk> their lives.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say that I don't.
We <unk> <unk> food.
Why do we do that?
Now, what I've been constantly <unk> is: <unk> many <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we don't want to be huge <unk> with one thing, which is wrong.
We don't want companies to <unk> lives.
We don't want companies to have <unk>.
And you know what my answer is all about this?
Yeah, you're right. <unk> this.
It's true, we have a <unk> <unk>, but that's not science.
That has nothing to do with science.
It's right, <unk>, <unk>.
You know that science is not a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
She's a process, and sometimes it works, and sometimes not, but the idea that we shouldn't allow science to do their work, because we're afraid of a <unk>, and it <unk> millions of people from the <unk>.
You know, in the next 50 years, we will have 70 percent more food than right now. 70 percent.
This <unk> in Africa in the last 30 years.
<unk>. <unk>.
They need that, and we don't give it to them.
And why? <unk> <unk> food.
We don't want to <unk> people to eat this <unk> stuff, like <unk>.
<unk> is something that a <unk> billion people eat.
It's sort of like a <unk>.
It's just a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's got no <unk>; it doesn't have any <unk>, and scientists are doing all this.
And then people could eat it and won't be <unk>.
You wouldn't be <unk>, and you know what?
That would be beautiful. It would not be <unk>, but it would be nice.
And all I can say is: Why are we doing this?
I mean, let's ask: Why are we doing this?
Because we don't want to <unk> genes?
It's not about <unk> genes. It's not about <unk>.
It's not about our <unk> passion for <unk>, our lack of <unk> food, <unk> food, <unk> food.
It's not about <unk> <unk>, it's about getting people alive, and it's getting time to understand what that means.
Because you know what?
If we don't do that, if we do that, as we do so far, we're going to be <unk> to something that I think we don't want to be <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There's no other <unk> for what's happening here.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's our <unk>, and we have to really <unk> that.
So after this incredibly <unk> <unk>, you might want to say, "Would you still go into these <unk> and go into the future?"
<unk>. That's what I want.
It's in the <unk>, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put these <unk> on everything we want.
We can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them, and we will move them where we want.
We have to have these <unk>, and we have to think, but when we go into the <unk> and go into the future, we're going to be able to have that.
I know that we can do it, and I think it's a little thing about what the world needs now.
Thank you. Thank you.
When <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, one day through the streets of <unk> <unk>, he heard a <unk> music.
She came from a man, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, who had <unk> on a <unk> that only had two <unk>.
A lot of you will be familiar with the story, because from <unk> 's <unk>, later on a book, which was <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, who was <unk> at the <unk>, and his <unk> 's <unk> career <unk> early early early early in the morning.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk>, and 30 years later, he lived as a <unk> on the streets of <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> you all to read <unk> 's book, or <unk> the film, so you don't just understand the wonderful <unk> that <unk> between these two men, but also how music <unk> this connection, and how she finally was the <unk>, when this <unk> is allowed to <unk> <unk> from the street.
I met <unk> <unk> in <unk>, two years ago, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He had just heard a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and came behind the stage to look at me.
He <unk> in a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and about how the <unk> would never create it in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and this was all because of the <unk> <unk> of the first <unk> in the last sentence by <unk> <unk>.
We came up with the <unk> <unk> of music, and a few days later, I got a <unk> <unk> who said that <unk> <unk> <unk> with me.
I have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> a medical treatment, because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> him his whole life.
So as a result, he's particularly <unk> to these <unk> <unk>, and they're sometimes so <unk> that they <unk> him to <unk>, and he <unk> <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk>, always <unk> in this <unk> and the <unk> of his own <unk>.
And in the same time that <unk> was <unk>, when we started with our first <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, he had lost this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and <unk>.
He was talking about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and about how someone <unk> him in the <unk>.
I was afraid, not <unk>, but I was afraid that I could lose him that he could <unk> into one of his <unk>, and that I could <unk> his relationship to <unk> if I <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> forms of <unk> <unk>.
So I just started playing.
I <unk> the first sentence by <unk> <unk>.
And while I was <unk>, I noticed that there was a <unk> change in <unk>.
It was as though he was under the impact of a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> that <unk> my game.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in understanding, in a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>.
And as a <unk>, he took his <unk> and started to play a few <unk> of <unk> and then <unk> me to go to the end: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
We started talking about music, starting by <unk> about <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and all the other <unk>, from <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And I realized that he doesn't just <unk> a <unk> knowledge of music, but it also <unk> it with a <unk> personal relationship.
He talked about it with a passion and an understanding that I could only know about my colleagues in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> he <unk> music and <unk> about music, was out of this <unk>, <unk> man who was <unk> by the streets of <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is medicine. <unk> changes us.
For <unk>, music is <unk> health.
Because the music allows him to <unk> his <unk> and <unk> with the help of his <unk> and creativity into something <unk>.
And so he <unk> his <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> that this is the nature of art.
And that's the reason why we make music, so that in all of us, <unk> in <unk>, our <unk>, through our <unk>, through our <unk>, through our creativity to reality.
And that reality <unk> <unk> <unk> all of us, moving, <unk> and <unk>.
What <unk> <unk> did, this music brought him back into a community of friends.
The <unk> power of music brought him back to a family of <unk> who <unk> him who saw his <unk> and <unk> it.
And I'm going to go back to <unk>, no matter in the <unk> <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk>, because he <unk> me why I've become <unk>.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: I want to play something that I <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
I hope you <unk> me.
I'm <unk> <unk>. I <unk> <unk>.
I've been <unk> for 10 years now, and my goal for the next <unk> is to make it as easy to save the world in reality, how to save it in <unk>.
I have a plan for this. I want to <unk> more people, <unk> to all of you, to spend more time with playing <unk> and <unk> games.
<unk>, we spend three billion hours a week of <unk>.
Some of you might be thinking, "That's a lot of time for games."
Maybe something too much time, when you look at how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
But in fact, my research on <unk> for the future is exactly the opposite.
<unk> billion hours a week are not <unk> enough to solve the <unk> problems in the world.
In fact, I am <unk> that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we have to <unk> <unk> this time.
I have <unk> that the <unk> time in <unk> billion hours of <unk> per week.
Now, the <unk> <unk> may be a little bit <unk>, so I'm going to <unk> it to be able to <unk> it, so if we want to solve problems like <unk>, poverty, climate change and <unk> <unk>, I think we have to try to do games online for at least <unk> billion hours a week.
No, it's really serious.
Why? This picture <unk> quite <unk>.
I think games are so <unk> to the <unk> of human species in the future. <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He wanted the <unk> to play in. So he <unk> a camera before the <unk>.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> in games.
If you're not a <unk>, maybe some of the <unk> in this picture.
You probably see this <unk> for <unk>, some <unk>, but also <unk> <unk>, <unk> into the <unk> of a real <unk> <unk>.
If you play, you can see some <unk> here, which <unk> up on the top side, and the <unk> are a sign of <unk>. The <unk> show <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Oh, you know. OK. <unk>.
So we have some <unk> here.
A <unk> <unk> is a result that's so <unk> that you didn't know it was possible.
It was <unk> 's <unk>. And if you do it, you're <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> just before a <unk> <unk>.
And this is what we have to see in a million <unk> of <unk> around the world, if we take the <unk> of the next century in <unk>, the face of <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk> on the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, unfortunately, we're more likely to see this face in real life when we're <unk> <unk> problems.
I <unk> it as the "Life I am bad."
And it's actually my face, you see? Yes? OK.
That's me, like I am, "in life, I am bad.
This is a <unk> in my <unk> <unk> in <unk>, California, where I <unk> in my <unk> why we are better in games than in real life.
This is a problem that many <unk> have.
We think we're not as good in the reality of play.
And I don't mean just less <unk>, even though that is.
We are <unk> more.
I mean, in the context of the <unk> to do something <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with each other.
When we're in a <unk> <unk>, I think many of us <unk> into our best version, <unk> and immediately <unk>, <unk> to solve the problem as long as <unk>, <unk> by the <unk> <unk>.
And in reality, when we <unk> when we <unk> on <unk>, we're often feeling different.
We feel <unk>. We feel <unk>. We feel <unk>, maybe <unk>, <unk> or <unk>.
These <unk> have never been, if we play games, they simply don't exist.
And that's what I wanted to look at as a <unk>.
Why is it impossible to think that you could not just reach everything?
How can we <unk> these <unk> out of play into reality?
So I looked at games like <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> the <unk> environment to <unk> <unk>.
And I've <unk> some things that <unk> <unk> in <unk> can do so possible.
So, first of all, if you go to one of these <unk> <unk>, especially at <unk> of <unk>, there's a lot of <unk> <unk> that are willing to give you a <unk> <unk>, and that's immediately immediately.
But not just <unk> <unk>, but a <unk> that <unk> perfectly to your <unk> <unk> in the game, right?
So you can do that.
You never get a task you can't solve.
But always the <unk> of your <unk>, so you have to <unk>.
But there's no <unk> in <unk> of <unk>. You don't sit around, and you're <unk>. There's always a little bit <unk> to do.
And there's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> you go, <unk> of people <unk> with you to <unk> your <unk> <unk>.
We don't have that so easy in real life, that feeling that there's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's this <unk> story, this <unk> story, why we are there and what we have, and then we <unk> this whole <unk>.
You have <unk> of "<unk> <unk>," and "<unk> <unk> <unk>" or "<unk> <unk>."
This <unk> <unk> is not in real life.
If I <unk> this stage, I didn't have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's idea, <unk> 20 <unk> idea.
I don't <unk> in the <unk> life of that <unk>.
So, the problem of <unk> as <unk> of <unk> is that it's so <unk> to <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>, that we <unk> to spend our time in these <unk>.
They're just better than reality.
<unk> today, all the <unk> of <unk> have spent <unk> million years trying to solve the <unk> problems of <unk>.
That's not necessarily a little <unk>.
It may sound <unk>.
But to see it in the context: <unk> million years ago, our first <unk> began to go.
So the first <unk> <unk>.
OK, so when we talk about it, how much time we spend <unk> play with play, it makes that sense when you look at the time in the <unk> of the <unk> of human development, what's <unk>.
But also <unk>, because it turns out that by <unk> all of this time, we're actually changing what we're doing.
We develop to <unk> <unk>, <unk> creatures.
That's the truth. I think that's the truth.
<unk> this interesting <unk> that recently was published by a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>: the <unk> young man of today in a country with <unk> <unk> 10,000 hours with <unk> to the <unk>.
So, 10,000 hours is a <unk> interesting number, for two reasons.
First, for children in the United States, <unk> hours are the <unk> <unk> that they spend in school, from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- if you never <unk>. So we have a <unk> here.
<unk>, on the young people in the same way, what it means to be a good <unk>, like everything they learn in school.
And maybe some of you may have read the new book by <unk>, "<unk>," you know his theory of <unk>, the theory of 10,000 hours.
It's based on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> <unk> of an <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, we become <unk> in it.
We're going to do so well in doing whatever the <unk> people in the world are.
So, what we have here is a <unk> generation of <unk> people who are <unk>.
So the big question is, "<unk> are <unk> <unk> good?"
Because if we could find out, we would never have <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So many people we have <unk> in the world who spend at least one hour per day with <unk>.
These are our <unk>, 500 million people, who are good in "<unk>."
And in the next decade, we have another billion <unk> that are <unk> well in whatever they are.
If you haven't heard it.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> energy and working on <unk>, rather than <unk>, so <unk> around the world, especially in India, China, can play online.
You expect a <unk> billion <unk> in the next decade.
So we have <unk> <unk> billion <unk>.
So I started <unk> what it is, let's make these games <unk>.
Here are the four things that I found. <unk>: <unk>.
OK, think about <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> to immediately <unk> a <unk>, <unk> with the belief that we have a <unk> hope for success.
<unk> always believe that a <unk> <unk> is possible, and it always <unk> to try and <unk> it.
<unk> are not around.
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's a lot of <unk> <unk> that show that we like people more after we <unk> with them, even though they have <unk> us.
And the reason is that there's a lot of trust to play a game with someone.
We <unk> that every time with us <unk> that the rules will <unk> that we have the same goal and to the <unk>.
So this <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, trust and <unk>.
As a result, we build <unk> social relationships.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>!
You know, there's one reason why the <unk> of <unk> is playing <unk> hours a week, like <unk>.
The reason is that, when we play, we're actually <unk> to work hard than if we <unk> or not.
We know that as human beings, we are <unk>, when we're <unk>, <unk> work.
And <unk> are always ready to work hard when they get the right job.
And ultimately, <unk> meaning.
<unk> love it to be part of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's a <unk> to <unk> that into the <unk> light, <unk> all the <unk>, the largest <unk> in the world.
The <unk> <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk>, is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> million people use it every month.
They have more information on the <unk> of <unk> on the Internet than about <unk> other <unk> in any other <unk> in the world.
They create a <unk> story.
They create a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> about the <unk> of <unk>.
OK, so these are four <unk> that lead to a single <unk>. <unk> are <unk>, <unk> individuals.
They are people who believe they can change the world.
And the only problem is they think they can change the <unk> <unk>, but not the <unk>.
That's the problem I'm trying to solve.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk>.
His work is <unk>.
People spend so much time, energy and money in <unk>.
And he says, "We're going to get <unk> of less than a <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk>."
And this is a <unk>. So he's <unk>.
And he says -- not like me -- I <unk> games, I'm a little <unk>.
So he says that the <unk> actually make sense, because <unk> can reach more than in real life.
They can <unk> social <unk> than in real life, they get more <unk> and more <unk> in games than in real life.
So he says it's <unk> completely <unk> that <unk> spend more time in the real world than in the real world.
I'm just going to <unk> that's <unk>.
But it's not <unk>.
We have to start to transform the real world into a game.
My <unk> comes from a <unk> that <unk> <unk> years.
There's this <unk> <unk>, from <unk>. You know?
<unk> these <unk> <unk>, there were <unk>.
And that was sort of the first people developed <unk>, and if you're with the <unk> of the old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, you may know this story. The story about how and why games were invented.
<unk> <unk> were <unk>, more <unk>, in the <unk> <unk> during a <unk>.
In <unk>, there was such a big <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to a <unk> idea.
<unk> people. People <unk>.
It was a <unk> situation. You needed a <unk> solution.
So they asked, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and a day would eat. The next day you would play.
And they would be so <unk> in the <unk>, because games are so <unk> and <unk> with <unk>, <unk> <unk> that they would forget that there was nothing to eat.
And then the next day you would play, and the next day you would eat.
And <unk> <unk>, she was doing this <unk> for 18 years, by going to <unk> and <unk> the next <unk>.
<unk>, I think we're <unk>.
We put games in order to <unk> the <unk> of the real world. We put games on, to <unk> everything that doesn't work in the real world, everything that's not <unk> in real life, and we take us what we need from games.
But it doesn't have to be the end.
That's the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> was not going to do the <unk> for 18 years, so the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> the <unk> in two <unk>.
It <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They were <unk> <unk>, and they went to search for a new <unk>, and they were just going back so many people as there were <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> with the rest of a <unk> that they could <unk> in.
That sounds crazy, right?
But <unk> <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> that later <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the same DNA as the old <unk> <unk>.
So scientists recently came to the <unk> that <unk> 's <unk> is actually true.
And <unk> found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years of what the <unk> might explain.
So this <unk> <unk> could <unk>.
In fact, they were actually <unk> their <unk> through play by <unk> for 18 years in games, and then they had these <unk>, and so much about the <unk> <unk> that they <unk> all the <unk>.
So we can.
We've been playing for <unk> <unk>.
This was the first <unk> in <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk>. This was 16 years ago.
It <unk> for 18 years, we have been playing <unk> for 16 years.
I <unk> we are ready for our own <unk> game.
So, they <unk> half of their <unk> to look for a new world, so I'm going to take my <unk> billion <unk> a week.
We should <unk> that half of us have an hour per day, until we have the problems of the real world.
I know you're going to ask, "How do we solve problems of the real world
And exactly this question, I've <unk> my work in the <unk> for the future.
We have this <unk> in our office in <unk>, it <unk> out how to understand the future.
We don't want to try to say the future before.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to <unk> the <unk> result, and then people <unk> to <unk> that idea into reality.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and give people the opportunities to achieve them.
I'm going to show you about three games that I've designed to try to try and <unk> people together in their own future.
This is "<unk> without oil."
The game is from <unk>.
It's a <unk> where you have to <unk> a <unk>.
The <unk> is invented, but we have <unk> <unk> so that it's <unk> for you, and you're actually going to live without oil without oil. So, if you go to play, tell us where you're going, and then you get <unk> in <unk> that show you how much oil is not, like <unk> <unk>,
As <unk> is <unk>, whether schools are <unk>, and you have to figure out how to make your <unk> life, if it would be true, and we're asking you to <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk>.
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk>, and we <unk> it over the last three years.
And I can tell you it was an <unk> experience.
<unk> wants to change his life because it's good for the environment or because we should.
But if you're in a <unk> and you say, "<unk> is the oil."
This is a <unk> <unk> that you are on.
<unk> out how to survive. Most of our <unk> have <unk> in the game.
So for the next <unk> game, we have <unk> a <unk>, <unk> goal than just <unk>.
We created the game "<unk>" at the <unk> for the future.
<unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> that people only have <unk> years on the planet.
This <unk> is called <unk> <unk> <unk>, of course.
<unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, we were almost like a "<unk>" <unk>.
They know <unk> <unk>, where they have the "<unk>," and they have the <unk>, the scientists, the <unk> and only together, they can save the world.
But in our play, instead of just five people, we say, everyone's in the <unk>, and it's our job, the future for energy, food, health, security and the future of social <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the game for eight weeks.
They found 500 incredibly <unk> solutions that you can <unk> if you <unk> <unk>.
And this is the last game we <unk> out on the <unk> <unk>. It's a game in <unk> with the <unk>.
If you <unk> the game, you get <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
We're working with <unk> in very <unk>, and we asked them to learn how to learn <unk>.
We have a <unk>. We have <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, vision and <unk>.
So I'd like to share all of you to share this game with young people all over the world, especially in <unk> who <unk> to <unk> their own social <unk> to save the world.
I'm going to go to the end.
I want to ask you a little bit.
What do you think happens as a <unk>?
We have all these <unk> <unk>, we have games that show us what we can do, but we don't have the real world yet.
<unk>, I hope you're <unk> to me that there are human resources that we can use to work in real life, and that games have a big meaning for change.
We have all these <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the ability to <unk> <unk> social <unk>, <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> meaning.
I really hope that we're playing <unk> games to play another century on this planet.
And I hope you'll design these play with me and play.
When I go to the next <unk>, I'm sure I'm <unk> with two things: that we can create every <unk> future, and that we can play all sorts of games. So I say, <unk>, the <unk> start.
<unk>.
I've been <unk> for the <unk> for a long time. It may seem like a <unk> to be interested in it, because, you look like me, as I say, as a <unk> <unk> to something, if someone's <unk> enough to believe enough.
In some studies, <unk> have shown a <unk> <unk> in some studies, the <unk>, and only <unk>, because the person think that what happens to you is a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk>, for example, there is, if the <unk> <unk> only to believe enough, a <unk> <unk> in the body called the <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> will <unk> into something, because somebody's so <unk>.
So for us to understand, I want to show you a <unk>, very simple <unk>.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> that <unk> at least since the <unk> in every <unk>.
I myself learned it from the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> him for you and explain him.
And then I'll explain why I <unk> it.
So, look what happens.
The <unk> you can study, my hand you can study.
I will just keep the <unk> in my <unk>.
I <unk> my <unk> back.
And to <unk> that there is nothing in my <unk> <unk> or from him, I'm just going to <unk> my <unk> right there.
In this way, you can see that there's no time to move anything. <unk> I <unk> here can't be in my <unk> or <unk>.
And the goal is very simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and hopefully if everything goes well, the <unk> will <unk> through my <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's actually <unk> in this room that I can <unk> it without <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in my <unk> or comes out, not <unk>. And you can <unk> everything.
<unk>!
Now, this is a <unk> that I often <unk> small kids who are interested in <unk>, because you can learn a lot about <unk> when you <unk> <unk>, even though it's a very simple <unk>.
<unk>, many of you know this in the <unk> of this <unk>.
He works <unk>.
I hold that <unk> in my hand.
I say I <unk> my <unk> to make sure that nothing in my <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and this is a <unk>.
The reason I <unk> my <unk> is that there's the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
In the moment, where I <unk> my hand from you, so you see it from <unk>, this <unk> here, my <unk>, just from where he was, in a position where he's so <unk>.
<unk> <unk>?
There is somebody who has no childhood.
So he's here. That's right.
And when I look at me, the <unk> changes its position.
And now you could talk about why it's a <unk>, why you don't realize there's just three <unk> on the bottom: because the mind and the way it <unk> information, it's not <unk> <unk>, one, two, three, but it's a group.
But that's really what it's really about now. And then I <unk> my hand.
Of course, it will be there, but not by the <unk> of my body, but through a <unk>, through my <unk>, who is now there.
And when I <unk> my hand, the same thing I'm going to do is <unk> through this <unk> that the <unk> <unk>.
I take that hand away. And here's the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> can <unk> your friends and <unk>. Thank you.
Now, what does this have to do with the <unk>?
A year ago or so, I <unk> a study that really <unk> me right.
I'm not a doctor or <unk>, and so that was an amazing thing for me.
So it turns out this: If you <unk> a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk>, in the form of a <unk>, it's just a <unk>, <unk> <unk> that has <unk> a certain <unk>.
But if you look at the shape in which you <unk> the <unk>, for example, in a <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> on it, it's actually <unk> <unk>.
And that, though, none of them -- they're just <unk>.
But a <unk> <unk> is not as good as a <unk> <unk>.
What? It really made me <unk>.
It turns out that it's not all.
When you take <unk>, it's more <unk> than any <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> at an end, and the other is better than a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> also <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> is not as good as three <unk> a day -- I can't remember the <unk> <unk>. <unk> me.
And the <unk> is,...
The <unk> also play a role.
And the shape is <unk>.
And if you want to have the <unk> <unk>, you have to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk>? A <unk> with a <unk> -- some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that you <unk> to a patient.
This creates a very <unk> picture in your head. It's much more <unk> than a <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> is really -- I'm going to show you a different time when we have a <unk>.
So the fact is that the <unk> <unk> did not <unk> as well as the <unk> <unk> that doesn't <unk> as well as a <unk> that doesn't <unk> as well as the <unk>.
And none of this has really <unk> <unk>. It's just our <unk> that <unk> in us a <unk> <unk>.
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a <unk>.
I'm going to take something that's obviously a <unk>, and <unk> it look real.
So we know from <unk> trial that you have to <unk> to the <unk> when it's supposed to go.
This is a 18 <unk> long <unk>. She's very, very <unk>, and I'm going to go through a little bit of a little bit.
This is really my <unk>. It's not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is my skin. This is not a <unk> from <unk>.
So I'm going to <unk> these <unk> into my skin, and then <unk> through it, <unk> it down on the other side.
If you're <unk> -- if you're slightly <unk> in <unk> -- I have <unk> this a couple of friends in <unk>, and some people that I don't <unk>, and this is a woman almost <unk>.
So, I <unk> if you get <unk> fast, then look for the next 30 seconds, or, you know what, I'm going to make the first <unk> part here.
You can see it directly, you can also <unk> if you want to.
So, it's like, right here, where my <unk> <unk>, at the <unk> part of my <unk>, I'm just going to make a little <unk>.
I'm really <unk>. <unk> you crazy?
And just a little bit through my skin and on the other side.
Now we're actually in the same situation that we had <unk>.
<unk>.
But now you can't <unk> my <unk>, right?
So I'm going to show you. That's one, two, three, four, five.
Well.
I know what people think when they see that.
They say, "Okay, it's not that <unk> and <unk> the skin just to <unk> for us a few minutes."
Well, then I'll show it to you.
What does this look like? <unk> well.
Yeah, I know. And people said, "Okay. I haven't seen that right."
The people in the <unk> are coming in.
Let me show you close.
This is really my skin. This is not a <unk> from <unk>.
This is my <unk>, and I can <unk> that.
<unk>. If you're <unk>, look away, don't look at it.
People would say, or the ones that later, at some point, they're going to say, "Well, this looks fairly <unk>, but if it was really, it would -- you know, here's a hole and there, if it was really real, it would <unk>."
Okay, let me <unk> a little blood for you.
Yes, there it is.
So now I would <unk> the <unk>.
I would <unk> my arm and show you that there are no <unk>.
But I think, in this <unk> here, and with the <unk> to make a <unk> out of a <unk>, I'm just going to let the <unk> go there and go like that.
We're going to <unk> a few times in the next few days.
I hope you guys <unk> on it. Thank you.
So I have a lot of fish in my life.
I only have two <unk>.
This first, this was more like a <unk> <unk>.
It was a <unk> fish, <unk>, good <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> on the <unk>.
What a fish.
Even better, he was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So you could feel comfortable with him.
I had a relationship with this beauty about several months.
One day, the <unk> of the company <unk> up and asked if I could <unk> in a <unk> about the <unk> of <unk>.
"Of course," I said.
Here was a company that was trying to solve what this <unk> problem has become, and how do we <unk> fish on our <unk>?
In the last 50 years, we've <unk> the <unk> <unk> of how we <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's hard to <unk> the <unk>.
90 percent of the big fish, the ones we love, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, they're <unk>.
It's almost nothing more <unk>.
So <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, is going to be part of our future.
A lot of <unk> against it. <unk> <unk> the environment, most of them <unk>, and they're <unk>, we take <unk>. A big <unk>.
It has a <unk> of 15 to one.
That means that 15 <unk> <unk> are <unk> so you get a <unk> <unk>.
Not very <unk>.
Not very good at all.
So finally, finally a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to <unk> them.
On the day of <unk>, I <unk> the <unk> of <unk> for the company.
Let's <unk> him.
"<unk>," I said, "just to have the facts right, their <unk> <unk> so far out in the ocean so that you don't <unk> the environment."
"That's true," he said. "We are so far out there, the <unk> of our fish is <unk>, not <unk>."
And then he <unk>, "We're essentially a <unk> world.
This <unk> of <unk> to <unk>, "he said.
"The best in the <unk>."
<unk> to one, great.
"<unk> to one thing? What are you doing?"
"<unk> <unk>," he said.
"<unk>," I said. <unk>.
And that night I was in the <unk>, and I thought, what the hell is a <unk> <unk>?
So I <unk> the next day, just before the <unk>, <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, what for example are <unk> <unk>?"
He said he doesn't like that. He's going to <unk>.
Now, I <unk> with a bunch of people in the company. No one could give me an <unk> answer, until I finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
Let's <unk> it as well.
"<unk>," I said, "What are <unk> <unk>?"
Well, he <unk> some <unk> and some <unk>, and then he said, <unk>.
I said, "<unk>?"
He said, "Yes, <unk>, skin, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>."
I said, "How much percent <unk> is <unk>?"
In the <unk> of maybe two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent," he said.
I said, "<unk>, what is <unk> about getting <unk> to fish?"
There was a long <unk> in the <unk>, and he said, "There's just too much <unk> in the world."
I'm <unk> by this fish.
No, not because I'm an <unk> and <unk>.
That's me.
No, I'm actually <unk> by this fish because, I'm <unk> by God, the fish after that <unk> after <unk>.
This second fish, that's a different kind of <unk>.
It's the most <unk> way, the way you learn to know your fish, you learn more <unk>.
I first <unk> it in a <unk> in <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> had <unk> since <unk> by this fish since <unk>.
She's <unk> us.
He came to the table with a <unk>, almost <unk> <unk> color.
The <unk> had <unk> him.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk>, he was still <unk>.
Who can <unk> a fish so well after he got <unk>?
I can't, but this guy can.
Let's <unk> it. In fact, he's <unk>.
And no, he doesn't <unk> the fish, and he's not a <unk>. <unk> the way you and I understand.
He's a <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> corner.
It's close to the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> was in the hands of <unk>.
They were <unk> <unk> on what was basically <unk>.
They did that by <unk> the country.
They <unk> this <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and they <unk> water out of the country and out of the river.
Well, they couldn't <unk> that the <unk>, not <unk>.
And <unk>, it was a <unk>.
It brought about 90 percent of the <unk> <unk>, which are many <unk> for this place.
And so <unk> <unk> a <unk> company with <unk>.
What did they do?
They <unk> the flow of <unk>.
They literally <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the water, it <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the water.
She <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- and then <unk> and his company <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is incredible.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
It <unk> out on the <unk>, which is a million miles away, and everything you see are <unk> <unk> and this <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I wasn't there at the time with <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>, three parts of <unk> <unk> and part of "A <unk> to <unk>."
Okay? So there we were, and <unk> us through the <unk>, and I <unk> and <unk>, <unk> up to my <unk>, and <unk> <unk> in <unk> a <unk>.
Here he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now he <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
And here, there's a pattern of <unk> <unk> him to the <unk> <unk>.
It turns out that <unk> has spent the most part of his career in <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how he's become such a <unk>.
He said, "<unk>? I don't know about fish.
I'm a <unk> for relationships. "
And then he goes and <unk> into more <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And don't get me wrong, which was really <unk>, you know, the <unk> community, like that in the <unk>.
It's great, but I was <unk>.
And my head was <unk> on this <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> that I had at <unk>.
So I <unk> him. I said, "<unk>, what is it that <unk> fish <unk> so good?"
He showed the <unk>.
"I know, boy, the <unk>, the <unk>, the relationships, the relationships, that's incredible.
But what do <unk> eat fish?
What's the <unk>? "
Well, he <unk> to tell me that it's such a <unk> system that the fish eat what they eat in the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, that's what the fish <unk>.
The system is so <unk>, it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, who don't <unk> their animals?
<unk> the day, I <unk> up on this <unk> with <unk>, and I asked him, I said, "For a place to be so, of course," different than any <unk> that I'd ever been, "How do you success?"
It was like a <unk> was <unk> a <unk>.
And we <unk> around the corner, and we <unk> the <unk> <unk>, thousands and <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the eye.
"That's success," he said.
"<unk> <unk> her <unk>, <unk>.
She <unk>. "
<unk>? I was completely <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, don't they <unk> fish?"
"Yes," he said.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the <unk>.
Now, last year on this <unk> <unk> <unk>, more than <unk> different species.
This is the largest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> in Europe today.
I said, "<unk>, is a good <unk> <unk> not the <unk> you want to have on a <unk>?"
He <unk> his head, no.
He said, "We build <unk>, not <unk>.
This is a <unk> network.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
So the more <unk> the <unk>, the better the <unk>. "
Okay, let's <unk> that. A <unk> that <unk> their animals and a <unk> that <unk> their success on the health of their <unk>.
A <unk>, but also a <unk>.
Oh, and <unk> should not even be there.
It <unk> in a city <unk> miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, they fly <unk> miles to <unk>.
And every night they fly <unk> miles back.
They do it because they can follow the <unk> <unk> line of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>.
I had a sort of <unk> of <unk> <unk>, so I looked at <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, fly <unk> miles to the <unk> and do they fly <unk> miles back?
Is they the kids? "
He looked at me like I was <unk> a song of <unk> <unk>.
He said, "No. You do it because the food is better."
I don't have the skin of my <unk> <unk> <unk>, who was <unk>, and I don't like <unk>. I don't like it. I don't like it.
It's this <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I almost never <unk> with it.
And yet, when I put them in this <unk> in <unk>, they didn't actually <unk> to <unk>.
It <unk> <unk> and <unk>, like you would take a <unk> from the ocean.
I <unk> this to <unk> and he <unk>.
He said, "The skin <unk> like a <unk>.
It's the last <unk> before something <unk> into the body.
It's been <unk> over time to <unk> <unk>. "
And then he <unk>, "But our water has no <unk>."
Okay. A <unk> that doesn't <unk> their fish, a <unk> that <unk> their success at success.
And then I realized when he says a <unk> that has no <unk>, he <unk> <unk>, because the water that comes through these <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk>.
It's a river that <unk> all the things that <unk> <unk> today to lead them, <unk> them, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk>.
And when it <unk> through the system, and that <unk> is <unk> the water as it's <unk>.
The system is so <unk>, it <unk> the water.
So not just a <unk> that <unk> their animals, not just a <unk> that <unk> their success on the health of their <unk>, but a <unk> that is literally a <unk>, not just for those fish, but for <unk> and me.
Because when the water <unk>, it <unk> in the <unk>.
A <unk> in the ocean, I know, but I <unk> it, and that should be done, because these <unk>, like <unk>, is also <unk>.
You might say that she's a <unk> for the future of good <unk> whether we're talking about <unk> or <unk>.
What we need now is a <unk> new concept of agriculture, from one, where <unk> actually <unk> well.
But for many people, that's a bit too <unk>.
We are not <unk>, we <unk>. We are <unk>.
We love <unk>. We love small <unk>. We talk about <unk> <unk>. We eat <unk>.
And if you <unk> that these are the things that the future of good <unk> <unk> <unk> up somewhere and says, "Hey people, I love <unk> <unk>, but how are you going to <unk> the world?
How are you going to <unk> the world? "
<unk> I be honest?
I don't like that question.
No, not because we already produce enough <unk> to <unk> the world more than just.
A billion people are <unk> today.
A billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of <unk> <unk> in <unk>, not the <unk>.
Now, I don't like that question because it has been the <unk> of our <unk> for the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, <unk> to the Earth, <unk> on fish, and all the time the <unk> was asking, "If we <unk> more people, how <unk> can that be?"
This was the <unk>. It was the <unk>. It was the <unk> of the American agriculture.
We should call them what it is, a <unk> in <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> fast <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> these <unk>.
This is not <unk>, and it's not agriculture.
Our <unk> is <unk> today, not because of <unk> <unk>, but because of <unk> resources.
Not by <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but by <unk> land, not by <unk>, but by <unk> water, not by <unk>, but by <unk>, and not by <unk> and not by <unk> and <unk>, but by the fish in the ocean.
You want to <unk> the world?
Let's start with the question: How are we going to <unk> ourselves?
Or better, how can we create conditions that have <unk> every community to <unk> themselves?
In order to do that, don't look at the future.
It's really old, and it's <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> and machines are <unk> in it, and it has never made a really good for food.
Let's look at the <unk> model.
That's what <unk> on two billion years.
Look at <unk>, <unk> like <unk>.
<unk> that are not <unk> for themselves, <unk> that are <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>, <unk> that are not just <unk>, <unk> who are not just <unk>, but <unk> for relationships.
They are the ones who are <unk> for <unk>.
And if I'm really honest, it's a <unk> <unk> than I ever be.
You know, it's pretty, because if that's the future of the future, it will be <unk>.
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In my <unk>, I <unk> with the <unk> to school, every day per hour per <unk>.
And my <unk> always <unk> in a book, a <unk> <unk> that <unk> my mind in other <unk>, and <unk> me in my <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> also <unk> that I was always when I wasn't in school, through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> everything, and <unk> under the <unk>.
I was <unk> <unk>, you know.
It was always about trying to understand the world and <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
And my love to <unk> <unk> seemed to be <unk> in my environment, because then, in the <unk> <unk>, we <unk> to the moon and <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> came into our <unk> with his <unk> <unk> that <unk> us animals and places and a world of <unk> that we had never <unk> before.
So, I think that's pretty good at <unk> <unk>.
And I was an artist.
I could <unk>. I could <unk>.
And because there were no <unk> of <unk> <unk> that were still <unk> the whole <unk> in the <unk>, I had to create the images in my head.
We all had to do that at the time. If we were children as a child, we took the <unk> of the <unk> and we <unk> it to the <unk> in our <unk>.
My response was the <unk> and <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and all that.
In <unk>, I was constantly <unk> by teachers, like I was <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> had to <unk> out.
And what happened was something fascinating, because what <unk> me about <unk> <unk> <unk> was the idea of an <unk> world here on our Earth itself.
<unk>, I would never <unk> a <unk> world with a <unk>. It seemed quite <unk>.
But here was a world that I could actually <unk>, here on Earth, and it was as <unk> and <unk> as all of what I used to do when I read these books.
So I <unk> when I was 15, when I was 15.
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in <unk>, <unk> miles away from the next ocean.
But I didn't get <unk>.
I <unk> my father, until he finally finally made a <unk> in <unk>, New York, <unk>, on the other side of the <unk>, where we <unk>.
I made my <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> in the middle of <unk> in <unk>, New York.
But the ocean, but a real ocean, I got to the face two years later, looking for California.
In <unk>, in the 40 years of <unk> <unk>, I spent about <unk> hours of water, 500 hours of them in <unk>.
And I've learned that the world of <unk>, even in the <unk> <unk>, is so <unk> to <unk> life, as we can really <unk> to.
<unk> of nature doesn't know <unk>, <unk> to our own, <unk> human <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, I <unk> <unk> <unk> for what I see on my <unk>.
And my love to the ocean <unk>, with <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>.
When I looked at a <unk>, it was the <unk>.
That seemed to be the best way to <unk> my <unk>, to tell stories, to create images with my <unk>.
As a child, I <unk> <unk> and stuff like that.
So <unk> were the path to <unk> images and stories. The <unk> together.
Of course, the stories I came from from the <unk> was "<unk>," "<unk>," and "<unk>."
In "<unk>" I could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk>.
So <unk> <unk> my two <unk>.
<unk> <unk> happened in "<unk>," in order to solve a <unk> problem in that movie -- and that is that we had to create a sort of <unk> <unk>, so we <unk> on <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
What <unk> was the first <unk> <unk> ever to see in a movie.
The film didn't take any money, exactly what he did, he <unk> his <unk>, but let me <unk> something: the audience in the world was like <unk> from the <unk> who was <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> 's law is <unk> <unk> technology and <unk> no longer <unk> to <unk>.
So they saw something <unk>.
And I found that <unk> <unk>.
And I was like, "<unk>, this must be <unk> in the <unk>."
So we went to "<unk> 2," my next movie, still a lot further.
<unk> with <unk>, we were <unk> the guy from <unk> <unk>, and the success was <unk> by what this <unk> would be <unk>.
And it <unk>. <unk>, we had created something new, and the <unk> in the audience was the same, and we had a little bit more money with the movie.
From these two experiences, a whole new world has been <unk>, a whole new world of creativity for <unk>.
So I <unk> a company, along with my good friend <unk> <unk>, who was the best <unk> and <unk> at the time of the best <unk>.
The <unk> of this company was to <unk> the <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, and start to start with <unk> <unk>.
And then we did that, and we <unk> a <unk> like this.
But in the middle of the <unk>, we were <unk> that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- let's <unk> the company, actually, to slow down.
I had written this piece "<unk>," which should be the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> into very new <unk>, with <unk> human, <unk> <unk>, who were <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> should all be <unk>. And the world should be <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> quite beautiful, and people in my company told me that we were not able to do that.
So I <unk> this, and I did this other movie about the big <unk>, the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, I <unk> this as "<unk> and <unk> on a <unk>," a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> movie.
But <unk>, I really wanted to go to the real <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, I did the movie.
That's the truth. The <unk> didn't know that.
But I really <unk> them by saying, "We were <unk> to the <unk>. We <unk> the real <unk>.
We're going to show it in the <unk> of the <unk>.
That's <unk> important. It's a good <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And I asked them to <unk> a <unk>.
<unk> crazy. But that goes back to the fact that your <unk> can make a reality.
In fact, what we did is we <unk> a reality that I <unk> in a <unk> <unk>, four miles under the surface of the <unk>, and I <unk> the real <unk> through a <unk>.
This was not a movie, no <unk>, it was real.
So that really <unk> me.
And the <unk> were <unk>. We had to <unk>, and we had to <unk> and build everything.
And I noticed how much this <unk>, a <unk> <unk>.
Well, they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> into these <unk>, then you <unk> into these <unk>, <unk> environment, where there's no hope for <unk> when you don't get it back.
And I thought, "<unk>, that's just like I was in a <unk>.
That's really cool. "
I was <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> that <unk> with <unk> and science. It was everything. It was <unk>, it was <unk>. It was <unk>.
And it was an experience that couldn't give me <unk>.
Because, you know, I was able to imagine a <unk> for which we could make a <unk> <unk>, but I couldn't imagine what I would see outside the <unk>.
In some of the most <unk> <unk>, I saw creatures in <unk>, and sometimes things I've never seen before, sometimes things that had never seen before and for the science at the time when we saw it, not even words.
So I got really excited about this, and I wanted more.
And so I made a slightly <unk> decision.
After the success of "<unk>," I said to myself, "Okay, I want to put my <unk> as a <unk> in <unk> on ice, and I will <unk> for a <unk>."
And then we started <unk> this <unk>.
We <unk> to the <unk>, and we <unk> them with <unk>.
We went back to the <unk> of <unk>.
We took little robot that we had built, which <unk> a <unk>.
Our <unk> was <unk>, <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, which had never been done before.
No one had ever <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and you didn't have any means for it, so we developed the <unk> technology.
And then I'm <unk>, on the <unk> of the <unk>, in a <unk>, and I see <unk> that are quite <unk> in this <unk>, and I know that <unk> has the <unk> there.
And I <unk> with a little <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk>.
I'm really <unk> it, but my consciousness is within the <unk>.
It felt like I was <unk> within the <unk> of <unk>.
That was the most <unk> form of a <unk> I've ever <unk>, because before I <unk> around a corner, I always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the <unk>, because I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when we <unk> the film.
And that was a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
So this was an <unk> <unk> experience.
And she made me realize this <unk> that you use such <unk> <unk>, and so you use your consciousness into the <unk>, into this other form of <unk>.
It was really <unk>.
And maybe a little <unk> on what might be done in some <unk>, if you have <unk> to <unk> something or do other things in all possible <unk> that I can think of as a <unk>.
After these <unk>, we started what we saw down there, really <unk>, like this <unk>, where we saw these incredibly <unk> animals, and these are <unk> <unk>, but here on <unk>.
They're living with <unk>.
They don't exist in a <unk> <unk> system like we do.
And so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees <unk>.
<unk> are living. And you can't imagine that they can survive there.
At the same time, I was very interested in <unk>, which was the <unk> from my childhood.
And so I <unk> to the people who care about the <unk>, and they have to do with the <unk> and they sit in the <unk>, and they go to the <unk>, and they go to the right <unk>, and they go to <unk>, and they go to <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and then they go to the <unk>, then fly to the <unk> <unk> and take our <unk>.
That was <unk>.
But at the end, it got out that I took <unk> with us.
I took them up, and I <unk> them to the world at the bottom: <unk>, <unk>, people <unk> for these kinds of <unk> <unk>, and I took them to the <unk> so they could <unk>, <unk> and test <unk> and so on.
Now, we <unk> <unk>, but actually science, actually said, <unk>.
So the <unk> between my <unk> as <unk>, then as a child, and the <unk> in reality.
I've learned a lot about it.
I learned a lot about science, but I also learned a lot about <unk>.
Now, you know, a <unk> also has to lead, a <unk> like a <unk> or something.
I don't use a lot of <unk> before I <unk> this <unk>.
Because at some point, I had to say to myself, "Well, what do I do here?
Why are I doing this? What's going on? "
These <unk> <unk> don't bring us any money.
We're just going to play the <unk>. It's not a <unk>.
Everybody think I was between "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and would have been the <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
I've got all these <unk>, these <unk>, for a very small audience.
No <unk>, no <unk>, no money. What are you doing?
You <unk> it around the task to <unk> the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that you have. You <unk> it for <unk>, and because of the <unk> connection that <unk> when a small group of people <unk> a team.
Because we've done all this with just 10 to 12 people who have <unk> <unk> <unk>, and sometimes we were two to three months of <unk> on <unk>.
And in this community, you <unk> that the most important thing you have is the most <unk> thing you have before each other, because you've got a problem that you can explain <unk> other things.
If you go to the country and you say, "We had to do it, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the whole technology, and the <unk>, the human <unk>, when you're working on <unk>," you can't really explain to the other things. It's like <unk> or <unk> who have done something in common and know that they can never explain to someone.
There's a connection, a <unk> <unk>.
So when I started to make my next film "<unk>," I was trying to make <unk> <unk>, that you would <unk> his team and <unk> yourself in the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> was really changed.
So I was <unk> with a small team on <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> "<unk>" with a new technology that we didn't have before.
<unk> <unk>.
A <unk> challenge.
And we became a real family for <unk> years.
<unk>, my way of making <unk> is completely <unk>.
There were people who were <unk>, and we really had these <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet.
For me, it was more a <unk> way to do my job, the <unk> process, which has changed in the <unk>.
So what can we <unk> out of all this?
What <unk> did we learn?
I think that's what <unk> is about.
It's the <unk> human <unk>.
Our <unk> is a force that can actually create a reality.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> is more important than any <unk> in the world.
To me, young <unk> who say, "<unk> me a <unk> of how I can do something like this."
And I say, "Don't take you.
It's <unk> to you. Don't <unk> it, don't <unk> to yourself. <unk> your <unk> on you. "
The <unk> has such a <unk>: "<unk> is not a <unk>."
But in art and <unk>, <unk> must be a <unk>, because there's a <unk> there.
No <unk> <unk> to <unk> the innovation, no one has been <unk>.
You have to be willing to take those <unk>.
So that's the idea I'd like to share with you. <unk> is a <unk>, <unk>, but it's not. Thank you.
Now, if I want to <unk> to you today, the <unk> of the data that we're <unk> is bigger than the <unk> of their <unk>, and instead of <unk> in <unk>, I'd like you to think about how we can use information, that <unk> <unk> and we see so <unk> that might not have been <unk>.
So, what we're seeing here is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The program that I'm <unk> here is a little experiment.
It's called <unk>, and what I can do with <unk> is that I can <unk> after a certain <unk>, we say <unk>.
And immediately, I see a different pattern that <unk>.
And that's because in the <unk>, people are <unk>, and they're <unk> here.
We can go one step further, and then <unk> the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the <unk> <unk>, but not for everyone.
Now, when we go back and <unk> by age, we say 40 years or <unk>, we see that <unk> is even the <unk> of people to worry about.
And who <unk> <unk>, it's particularly <unk> in men.
So you can see that the <unk> of information and data in this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And if we can do this for <unk>, why not for <unk>?
What we have here is the <unk> every single "<unk> <unk>," which have ever been <unk>.
It's all here. It's all online.
I want you to test it in your <unk>.
With <unk>, they can <unk> into a <unk>.
You can <unk> in a <unk> year.
You can <unk> directly to a certain <unk>.
Now, when I look here, I see the <unk> that <unk> in this <unk> and the <unk>.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>, so I <unk> <unk> <unk> to me all the <unk> in which <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
Now, if I just want to get a <unk> <unk>, I could think, "Okay, what if I <unk> everything about this <unk>?"
So I go back and I <unk> the <unk>.
Now I see <unk> <unk>.
And so you get an idea that when you look at this kind of information, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you don't just <unk> or <unk> just.
You do something that's actually a little bit different.
It's something <unk>, and we think it changes the way that information can be used.
So I want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy.
What we've done here is we've taken every single <unk> and put it on a little <unk>.
<unk> <unk> a quick <unk> and a <unk> for the <unk> that comes from.
I'm just going to show the <unk> 500 of the <unk> <unk>.
But even in this <unk> view, we can do a lot of things.
And then we get a <unk> of the <unk> that are on <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the <unk> government.
Well, after I <unk> 'government, I <unk> that the <unk> that <unk> most <unk> <unk> of <unk> people are <unk>.
This is really important because this is a <unk> that's not in a single <unk>.
That's just to recognize when you look at a step and look at it.
In <unk> to one particular <unk>, I can then go into the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's <unk> and see all together.
Now, when I look at all these <unk>, I <unk> that the <unk> are <unk> from this. Some of them come from science. Some, even less, come from the economy. Here's my <unk>. And one comes out of the <unk>.
And <unk> is also a TED <unk> <unk>.
So now we can go back and look at all of the TED <unk> <unk>.
So you can see, in the Web, the first time it's really a network, not just from the side, it's much more <unk>.
And so I want to show you what different <unk> might be.
I'm just going to show you the New York Times <unk> here.
<unk>, this <unk> -- I don't want to call it a <unk>; it's really not a <unk>, but you can look at it -- and we bring these <unk> to every single <unk> like this.
So I can <unk> one step, and I can go directly to a <unk> <unk>.
So this is important because you can only look at the <unk> of <unk> in this way, all the <unk> in the same way.
So I can go to my <unk> <unk> in a particular <unk>.
Here's the <unk> of the whole <unk> that I've <unk> to <unk>.
And I can sort of <unk> everything I've been <unk> for today.
And if I take a step back and <unk> to everything, I can <unk> my <unk>, perhaps after my <unk>. Here, I <unk> to <unk>, here after <unk>, or <unk> here to <unk> <unk>.
And from here I can go to the side and <unk> them again.
It's a <unk> that's been used again, and every time it does the <unk> bigger than the <unk> of the <unk>.
Right now, in this world, we think that data is a <unk>.
We're talking about the <unk> of the <unk>.
We're talking about the <unk> of information.
What if we could <unk> this situation, and put the Internet on the head, so that instead of being <unk> from one to the other, then we start to go from a lot of things to lots of things, and <unk> patterns that would be <unk> <unk>?
If we can do that, then this <unk> will <unk>, maybe a new <unk> of <unk> information.
And, rather than just moving into information, we can get knowledge of it.
And when we experience knowledge, then maybe we can even pull out of it.
So I <unk>, thank you very much.
Everybody's talking about happiness today.
I've got some people <unk> the number of books that have been published with "<unk>" in <unk> in the last five years, and they gave me about 40, and there's a lot more.
There's an <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of happiness under <unk>.
There's a lot of <unk>.
Everybody would like to make people <unk>.
But despite all these <unk> of work, there are several <unk> <unk> that make it almost impossible to think about happiness.
And my talk today is mostly <unk> by these <unk> <unk>.
That's true for <unk> who think about their own happiness, and it's true for scientists who think about happiness because it's <unk> that we are as <unk> as anybody.
The first of these <unk> is a <unk>, complexity <unk>.
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no <unk> word, because we <unk> it up to lots of different things.
I think there's a certain meaning that we could <unk> it, but in <unk> and <unk>, that's something that we need to be <unk>, and we will have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of what's <unk>.
The second <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>: basically, it's between happy in his life and happy to his life or happy with his life.
And these are two very different <unk>, and they're both <unk> in the notion of happiness.
And the third one is the <unk>, and that's the <unk> fact that we can't think about a <unk> that <unk> <unk> without <unk> his meaning.
I mean, this is a real <unk> <unk>.
There's simply no way to get it right.
Now, I'd like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my <unk> who <unk> a story. [<unk>...] He said he had a <unk> <unk>, and it was absolutely <unk> music, and at the end of the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then he <unk> <unk>, really quite <unk>, that <unk> the whole experience.
But it didn't.
What it <unk> was the <unk> of the experience.
He had the experience.
He had 20 minutes of <unk> music.
She didn't know because he was <unk> with a memory; the memory was <unk>, and the memory was everything he had to <unk>.
What really tells us is that we might think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self.
There's a <unk> self living in the <unk>, and the <unk> knows the <unk>, <unk> the past, but essentially just the <unk>.
It's the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know, when the doctor says, "Are you going to be <unk> now if I'm standing here?"
And then there's an <unk> self, and the <unk> self is that, the <unk> and the story of our life <unk> <unk>, and it's <unk> that the doctor <unk> by asking the question, "How have you <unk> in <unk> time?"
or "How was your journey to <unk>?" or something like that.
These are two very different <unk>, <unk> self and the <unk> self, and the two to <unk> is part of the <unk> of happiness.
Now, the <unk> self is a <unk>.
And that really starts with a <unk> response to our <unk> -- it starts immediately.
We don't just tell stories when we're trying to tell stories.
Our <unk> tells us stories, which is what we're allowed to <unk> from our <unk> is a story.
And let's start with one example.
There's an old study.
These are real patients, <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
I won't go into <unk>. She's not <unk> today, but she was <unk> when this study was done in the <unk>.
They were asked to <unk> every 60 seconds of their <unk>.
And here are two patients. These are their <unk>.
And you'll ask, "Who one has more <unk>?"
And that's a very simple question.
<unk> <unk> has more <unk>. His <unk> was longer, and every minute of pain that <unk> A had <unk> <unk>, and more.
But now there's a other question: "How much did these patients think they <unk>?"
And here's a <unk>.
And the <unk> is that <unk> A a lot of <unk> <unk> was <unk> than <unk> <unk>.
The stories of <unk> were <unk>, and because a very <unk> part of the story is how they <unk>.
And none of these stories is very <unk> or <unk> -- but one of them is <unk>, but one of them is much worse than the other.
And the rate that was worse was where the pain was very close to his <unk>. It's a <unk> story.
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people for their <unk>, and they said, "How <unk> was the whole thing <unk>?"
She was much worse for A than for <unk> in <unk>.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> between the future self and the future self.
From the <unk> self, <unk> had a great time.
Now, what you could do with <unk> A, and we actually did <unk> experiments, and it's done, and it works, you could actually <unk> the <unk> of <unk> A <unk> by simply <unk> the <unk> <unk> without <unk> it.
That will lead the <unk> <unk>, but only a bit, much less than before.
And if you do that for a few minutes, you have <unk> that the <unk> self <unk> from <unk> A <unk> is <unk>, and you have <unk> that the <unk> self of <unk> is a much better <unk>, because now you have <unk> A a better story about his experience.
What is a story about?
And that's true for the stories that <unk> us, and it's true to the stories that we <unk>.
<unk> a story is <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> are very, very important, and in this case, the end is <unk>.
Well, the <unk> self lives lives.
It has <unk> of <unk>, one after another.
And you ask, what happens to these <unk>?
And the answer is really simple. They're lost forever.
I mean, most of our lives -- and I've got the <unk> -- you know, the <unk> <unk> is true than about three seconds long, which means that in a life, there are about <unk> million of them. In a month, there's about <unk>. Most of them are not <unk>.
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk> self.
And yet, you sort of get the <unk> that they should be <unk> that what is our life during this <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> as we are in the world.
And as we <unk> it would be important, but it's not the story that <unk> the <unk> self for us.
So we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self, and they're really quite <unk>.
The biggest difference between them is the <unk> of time.
From the <unk> self, if you have a <unk>, and the second week is just as good as the first one, the <unk> <unk> <unk> is as good as the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't really work at all the future self.
For the <unk> self, a <unk> <unk> is <unk> better than the <unk> <unk>, because there's no new <unk>.
They didn't <unk> the story.
And in this way, time is actually the <unk> <unk> that an <unk> self <unk> from a <unk> self, very little influence on this story.
Now, the <unk> self is doing more than <unk> and telling stories.
It's actually a <unk> that makes decisions, because if you have a patient who has a patient, we've had two <unk> at two different <unk> and <unk> what to <unk>, then the <unk> of who has the memory, which is less <unk>, and that's the <unk> that's going to be <unk>.
The <unk> self has no voice in that <unk>.
In fact, we don't choose between <unk>. We choose between <unk> to <unk>.
And even when we think about the future, we don't normally think of our future as <unk>.
We think of our future as <unk> <unk>.
And essentially, you can look at this, you know, as a <unk> of the <unk> self, and you can think of the <unk> self as one, which sort of <unk> the <unk> self through experience that the <unk> self doesn't need.
I have the <unk> that when we make <unk>, it's very common, which means we make <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> self.
And that's a little bit hard to <unk>, I think.
I mean, how are we <unk> from our <unk>?
This is one of the <unk> that's given for the <unk> of the <unk> self.
And when I think about it, I think of a <unk> that we did in the <unk> a few years ago, the <unk> of the best <unk> I had ever had, and I often think often in the <unk> about how often I think about other <unk>.
And I probably <unk> my <unk> to this <unk> journey, I would say about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I've ever <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> images, I would have spent another hour.
Now, this is three weeks, and this is <unk> <unk> hours.
There seems to be a <unk>.
Now, I like to be a little <unk>, you know, how little <unk> I have on the <unk> of <unk>, but even if you do more of it, there's a real question: Why do we give <unk> so much weight in the <unk> to the weight we give <unk>?
So I want you to think about a <unk>.
Imagine your next <unk>, you know, at the end of the <unk>, you're all going to be <unk>, and you get a <unk> so that you're not going to remember anything.
Now would you choose the same <unk>? And if you would choose another <unk>, there's a <unk> between your two species of self, and you have to think about how you're going to decide this <unk>, and it's really not obvious, because if you think about time, you'll have an answer. And if you think of <unk>, you may have a different answer.
Why we <unk> the <unk> that we <unk> is a problem that <unk> us with a choice between the two species of self.
Well, the two species of self <unk> two <unk> of happiness.
There are actually two <unk> of happiness that we can <unk>, one per self.
So you can ask, how happy is the <unk> self?
And then you would ask, how happy are the <unk> in life's life?
And they're all -- happiness for <unk> is a pretty <unk> process.
What are the <unk> that can be <unk>?
And, <unk>, we're now <unk> a pretty good idea of happiness of the <unk> self over time.
If you ask the <unk> of the <unk> self, it's a very different thing.
This is not about how happy a person is.
It's how <unk> or <unk> the person is, when this person <unk> about her life.
Very <unk> term.
<unk> who's not going to <unk> this <unk> is going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> to a lot of <unk> on <unk> that have <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> long.
The <unk> between the <unk> self and the <unk> of the <unk> self has been <unk> in the last few years, and now you're <unk> to measure the two <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> has an <unk> <unk>, where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their <unk>, and there were other <unk> in the direction.
So in the last few years, we've started to learn about the happiness of both these kinds of self.
And the <unk> <unk> that I think we've learned is that they're really <unk>.
You can know how <unk> someone is with his life, and it doesn't really <unk> a lot of how happy he lives his life and <unk>.
Just to give you a sense of the <unk>, the <unk> is about <unk>.
What that means is that if you were meet someone, and you would tell you, oh, his father is a <unk>, how much would you know about your size?
Well, you would know about your size, but there's a lot of <unk>.
They have so much <unk>.
If I tell you that somebody's life as eight on a <unk> of 10, you've got a lot of <unk> about how happy he is to his <unk> self.
So the <unk> is <unk>.
We know something about what the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
We know that money is very important, <unk> are very important.
We know that happiness is <unk> to be <unk> with people we like to spend time with people we like.
There are other <unk>, but that's <unk>.
So if you want to <unk> the <unk> of the two types of self, you're going to do very different things at the end.
The <unk> of what I said here is that we really don't really should be <unk> as a <unk> for <unk>.
It's a completely different term.
Well, very short, another reason that we don't know clearly about happiness is that we don't look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live.
So if you ask the simple question, how happy people in California are not going to get the <unk> answer.
If you ask this question, you think that the people in California have to be <unk> if you, say, in <unk>.
And what happens is that when you think about life in California, think about the difference between California and other places, and that difference, we say, in <unk>.
Now, it turns out that <unk> is not very important for the <unk> self, and it's not even very important for the <unk> self that <unk> how happy people are.
Well, because the <unk> self is responsible, you can go to the end -- some people could go to California at the end.
And it's kind of interesting to track what happens to people that are <unk> to California to be <unk>.
Well, you're not going to be <unk>.
We know this.
But one thing is going to happen, you'll think they're <unk>, because if you think about it, you'll be <unk> by how <unk> the <unk> was in <unk>, and they're <unk> that they made the right decision.
It's very hard to think about <unk>, and I hope I have a sense of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris <unk>: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you.
Now, when we started <unk> a couple of weeks ago, <unk> me that there was a pretty <unk> <unk> that came out of this <unk>.
Is that something that you can <unk>, because you've <unk> a few minutes now?
<unk> <unk>: <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> that we've found in the <unk> <unk> is a number that we didn't really expect to find.
We found this in the <unk> of the <unk> self.
When we look at how <unk> <unk>.
And it turns out that under a <unk> of <unk> dollars a year, for Americans, and this is a very large <unk> of <unk>, about <unk> <unk>, but it's a big <unk> <unk>, under a <unk> income dollars a year.
CA: <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>.
<unk> dollars a year are <unk>, and they're going to be <unk>, they're going to be <unk>.
And then we get a perfectly <unk> line.
I mean, I <unk> saw so <unk> <unk>.
What happens is obvious is that money is not a <unk> <unk>, but that <unk> <unk> of money is probably <unk> <unk>, and we can measure this <unk> very, very clearly.
In the spirit of the other self, the <unk> self, you get a different story.
The more money you are <unk> the <unk>.
That's not true for <unk>.
CA: But <unk>, the whole American <unk> is about life, freedom, the <unk> of <unk>.
If people take this <unk> seriously, I mean, it seems to put it all on the head, everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on.
Is there a chance that there was a chance that the country was going to take a <unk> like <unk> and make it <unk> politics?
<unk>: You know, I think there are <unk> to the role of <unk> in politics.
The <unk> is going to be slow in the United States, no question, but in the United <unk>, they're happening in and in other countries.
People are <unk> to think about <unk> when they think about politics.
It's going to be a <unk> <unk>, and people will <unk> whether they want to study <unk>, or if they want to study <unk>, so we need to have this <unk> very soon.
How you can <unk> happiness is very <unk> on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self.
This is going to affect politics, I think, in the <unk>.
In the United States, you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population.
That will, I think, in the next one or two <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
CA: Well, it seems to me, this <unk>, or should be the <unk> political <unk> for <unk> over the next few years.
Thank you for the <unk> of <unk>.
Thank you, <unk> <unk>.
Today, I'm going to talk to you about energy and <unk>.
And maybe something that may be surprised because my <unk> in the <unk> is <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the things that we're <unk> and <unk> to make the <unk> two billion a better life.
But energy and <unk> are extremely important for these people, in fact, more important than for every other on the planet.
<unk> means that their <unk> will not grow over many years, and we're too much <unk>, and things will change to how it can't <unk> their <unk> environment.
That leads to <unk>. It leads to <unk>. It leads to <unk>.
So it's going to be a <unk> <unk> for them.
<unk>, it's very important for them.
In fact, if you could <unk> only one thing to the price, the <unk> would be energy at <unk>.
Well, the <unk> is over time.
In fact, <unk> is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and even in the <unk> century, there was a <unk> case in <unk>, and so we have <unk>, <unk>, we can make <unk> materials and do so many things.
So we are in a <unk> situation with electricity in the rich world.
But if we <unk> the price -- we let the price <unk> -- we make a new <unk>, and these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the planet, and the <unk> <unk> is really quite clear.
It <unk> the <unk> <unk> that goes to the <unk>, and this <unk> has some very <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk>, and maybe worse, the <unk> that the natural <unk> can't <unk> such <unk> change and <unk> all the systems.
Now, the <unk> relationship between a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where the more <unk> are <unk>, there's some <unk>, but not very many.
And there are certain <unk> of how <unk> are going to be, but they're going to be extremely <unk>.
I asked the <unk> <unk>, "Are we really going down to <unk>?
<unk> not half half or a <unk>? "
And the answer is, until we get close to <unk>, the <unk> will continue <unk>.
So it's a big challenge.
It's very different than to say, we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that has to <unk> under a <unk> <unk>, and then you can <unk> <unk>.
So this one has to go down, <unk>.
Well, we <unk> a <unk> <unk> every year, over <unk> billion <unk>.
<unk> Americans are about 20 <unk>, people from <unk> countries, less than one.
In the <unk>, it's about five <unk> for everyone on the planet.
And somehow we have to <unk> change that are <unk> to <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> different <unk> changes have <unk> at all, and we need to go from <unk> <unk> to <unk> and to a <unk> to <unk>.
This <unk> has four <unk>. A little bit <unk>. You have this thing on the left -- <unk> -- that you want to bring it to the <unk>, and it's <unk> by the number of people, from the <unk> that every human being in the <unk>, the <unk> energy for every <unk> and the <unk> that will <unk> per <unk>.
So, let's look at every <unk> <unk> and see how we get it to <unk>.
<unk>, one of these numbers has to come very close to <unk>.
Now that's <unk> <unk>, but let's go through it.
First of all, we have the population.
Today, <unk> billion people are living.
And it <unk> to <unk> billion <unk> that move on <unk> billion.
If we're very successful with new <unk> that might be <unk> and <unk>, we could probably <unk> that by 10 percent to 15 percent, but we're going to see a <unk> about <unk>.
The second <unk> is the <unk> we use.
That <unk> everything, the food we eat, <unk>, television, <unk>.
That's very good things, and <unk> means that these <unk> are almost to make it <unk> on the planet.
It's great that this number <unk>.
In the rich world, in the <unk> billion, we could be able to make <unk> and use less, but in the <unk>, this number every year will <unk> and <unk> more than <unk>, the number of <unk> <unk> per person.
Here we see a very <unk> <unk>. <unk> it home so you can read the <unk>?
And these students don't have it, so they go and read their <unk> under their <unk>.
Well, at <unk>, the <unk>, the energy per <unk>, has finally got good news.
We have something that's not <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk>, through other <unk>, through new <unk> in the <unk>, there are many <unk> <unk> that can <unk> you <unk>, <unk> <unk> can be <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>: <unk>: <unk> some <unk> <unk> by 90 percent.
Some individual <unk> <unk> by 90 percent.
In other <unk>, like the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>: <unk>: <unk> -- <unk> or <unk> or <unk>, the <unk> for <unk> is very much smaller.
<unk>, if we're <unk>, maybe we get a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> or maybe a <unk> <unk>.
But in the first three decades, we've gone from <unk> billion, maybe <unk> billion billion <unk>, and that's simply not enough.
So let's look at the <unk> <unk> -- and this will be a <unk> -- this is the amount of carbon <unk> per <unk>.
It <unk> the question of whether you can get that on <unk>.
<unk>: No.
<unk>: No.
<unk> every <unk> of electricity is <unk>, except the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
So, what we need to do on a global <unk> is to create a new system.
We need <unk>.
Now, when I say the term "<unk>," I don't mean the <unk>.
The <unk> is a <unk>. The <unk> is a <unk>.
The Internet and the <unk> is a <unk>.
People here have this <unk> of this wonder.
<unk>, there's no <unk> that you need to have a <unk> to a certain <unk>.
<unk>, you're just <unk> and some of them are coming, and some people don't.
But in this case, we have to give <unk> and get a <unk> in very <unk> time.
Now, I asked myself, how could I really <unk> this?
Is there a natural <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> the idea of people here?
I went to the last year when I got <unk>, and somehow people <unk> that.
So the idea became really <unk> for them, you know, there are people living with <unk>.
For energy, this is what <unk> me.
I decided the <unk> of <unk> would be my <unk> <unk> to the environment.
So here's some natural <unk>.
I told you they didn't <unk>, and in fact they don't even get the <unk>.
Well, there are all kinds of <unk> like this, but they don't get a lot.
We need to have the solutions, either one or a half who have an <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and while there are many <unk> where people are looking for, I'm really just five who can afford this great <unk>.
I have <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, these might be a <unk> <unk>, and if they give me <unk> than I <unk>, that would be great, but my <unk> here is that we have to work on all these <unk> five, and we can't <unk> them from them because they're <unk> to us, because everybody have <unk> problems.
Let's first look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> by either <unk> or <unk>.
What you have to do there is perhaps simple, but it's not. You have to <unk> all the <unk> that comes out of the <unk> after the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> under pressure, and then <unk> somewhere and hope that it <unk> there.
There are some <unk> that can <unk> that in a 60 percent -- 80 percent <unk>, but it's going to be <unk> to 100 percent, and it's going to be a big challenge, but the biggest problem here is <unk>.
Who will <unk> it?
Who can <unk> something, which literally many billion times greater than any kind of <unk> that you can imagine from <unk> and other things?
That's a lot of <unk>.
So this is a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>.
They also have three big problems: the cost, especially in <unk> countries are high, and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human <unk> that the <unk> is not used for weapons.
And then what do you do with the <unk>?
Because while it's not very big, there's a lot of <unk>.
People have to feel good. <unk> <unk>: 10, <unk>. <unk>: 10, <unk> three very <unk> problems that might be <unk>.
So three very <unk> problems that might be <unk>, and that's why you should be working on.
I <unk> the last three of five.
It's the <unk> <unk>, as they're called <unk>.
And also, although it's great, they don't need <unk> -- they have some <unk>.
One is the <unk> that these technologies create more <unk> than <unk>.
These are <unk>, you're talking about many <unk>, <unk> more <unk> than a <unk> <unk>.
And then these <unk> <unk>.
The sun doesn't seem like it all day, it doesn't seem to be <unk> every day, but it doesn't seem like the wind <unk> all the time.
That's why you have to, if you're <unk> out of these <unk>, you have to have a way to get the energy in times when you're not <unk>.
So there's big <unk> here. There are challenges in <unk>, and if we say <unk> that <unk> is outside the country, you don't need to only need the technology, you have to deal with the risk of the energy from where different <unk>.
And there's the <unk>.
And to show the <unk>, I <unk> all the kinds of <unk> that are made, <unk>: the <unk> of cars, computers, <unk>, <unk>, for everything. And that's me with the amount of dark energy that uses the world, <unk>, and I found that all the <unk> that we're <unk> are less than 10 minutes of <unk>.
So we need a big <unk> here, something that will be 100 better than the <unk> of the time.
That's not impossible, but it's not so easy.
That's what happens when you're trying to <unk> this <unk> <unk>, we're going to <unk> 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk>.
If you want to look at 100 percent, you need an incredible <unk>.
Now, where are we going to go: What is the right approach?
A "<unk> project"? How do we get to the goal?
What we need is many companies working on it. <unk>.
In each of these five <unk>, we need at least 100 people.
So many of you will say, they're crazy! That's good.
I think there are many people in the TED group who are already <unk>.
Bill <unk> has several companies, including one called the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies and interesting <unk> and I try to support that.
<unk> <unk> and I <unk> a company who might <unk>, <unk> the <unk> approach.
There are some <unk> in <unk>; <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> has <unk> in this <unk> recently <unk>, so it's not a big <unk> that some good <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> means that you <unk> <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>, one percent, the <unk>, we decided to <unk> the <unk> percent, the <unk>.
That's a pretty <unk> idea.
But in fact, you've had long <unk> about it long, but you couldn't <unk> <unk> if it would work, but if there's <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> and see that, yes! With the right <unk>, it looks like it's <unk>.
And because you <unk> that <unk> percent, it's much better.
In fact, you <unk> the <unk>, and you can even use the <unk> of today's <unk> as <unk>.
<unk> about your head, <unk> it. A great thing.
The <unk> is <unk> <unk>, a bit like a <unk>.
You can see it's kind of a <unk>, often called "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
<unk> really <unk> the <unk>.
Here's a picture of a <unk> in <unk>.
This is the <unk>, the <unk> percent. You have the part that's <unk> today, so it's called <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> the <unk> for hundreds of years.
And when you <unk> <unk> and simply <unk>, you get <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of the planet.
You know, there are many challenges there, but it's an example of many <unk> of <unk> that we need to get <unk>.
Let's talk about how we should measure our success.
What should our <unk> look like?
Now, let's go to the goal that we have to do, and then we talk about the <unk>.
A lot of people are talking about <unk> to <unk>.
It's really important to get there.
The <unk> 20 percent will be produced in <unk> countries, and still some agriculture, and the <unk> will be <unk> and <unk> until the <unk>.
So, in order to achieve this 80 percent, the <unk>, <unk> countries like China, their <unk> completely <unk>.
The other <unk> says whether we use the <unk> technology, whether it's <unk> in all developed countries, and we're on the path of getting them to the rest.
That's <unk> important.
That will be a <unk> of this <unk>.
If we were out there, what should the <unk> <unk> look like?
It should <unk> the two <unk>.
We should use the <unk> to get <unk> on the path, the less we <unk>, the more <unk> will be the <unk> and also the <unk>.
But in fact, this <unk> for the things that we're <unk>, which we're not completely <unk> to the big <unk>, just the same, or even a little bit less important as the other that <unk> the <unk> of innovation for these <unk>.
And we have to track this <unk> with <unk>, and we can measure that, in <unk>, in <unk> and <unk>.
There's a lot of great books about this <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> book, "We have a choice" and David <unk> "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
They're actually going through and create a <unk> where this can be <unk>, because we need to support support of all <unk>.
There is <unk> that needs to <unk>.
That's a wish.
A very powerful wish that we <unk> this technology.
If you give me a wish for the next 50 years, I could <unk> the <unk>, a <unk>, and I love that, or I could choose that wish, which is, <unk> <unk> without <unk>, I <unk> that wish.
This has the largest <unk>.
If we're not <unk> this wish, the <unk> is going to be <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk> people, between the United States and China, between <unk> and rich and almost every life of two billion are very much <unk>.
So what do we have to do?
And what <unk> I <unk>?
We have to use for more <unk>.
If countries are <unk> in places like <unk>, they shouldn't just talk about <unk>.
You should <unk> these <unk>, and you would be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> who are <unk> for these <unk> <unk>.
We need <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> something that makes a <unk>.
We have to spread the message.
We need to have <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also the things that are <unk> by government.
It's an important wish, but I think we can <unk> it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris <unk>: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Just to understand something better -- <unk>, can you give us an idea of <unk> of these <unk>?
Bill <unk>: In order to get the <unk> on a <unk>, to get all the big scientists, what we've done, we just need some 10 million. And even if we put our materials in a <unk> <unk> to make sure it works <unk>, it's just in the <unk> million.
The <unk> step is the <unk> of the first <unk> to find more billion, the <unk>, and the place that actually <unk> the first of it.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>, if it <unk> like <unk>, it's all clear, because the <unk>, the <unk>, is so different from <unk> as we know it.
CA: So to understand that really, this means deep in the ground almost like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, this <unk> <unk>, and then the process starts moving up, and they're going to <unk> down?
<unk>: Right. Now, you've got to <unk> the <unk> always, so there are many people and lots of <unk> who can go out and <unk> it, and things like that, and stuff <unk> or <unk>. It's not good!
But if you have very <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a <unk> -- which <unk> you without the whole <unk>.
And it's sitting there and it <unk> for 60 years, and it's done.
CA: A <unk> who <unk> a solution to the <unk>.
<unk>: Yeah. Now, what happens with the <unk>: You can let it sit -- there's a lot less <unk> with this <unk> -- then you take it and you put it in the next <unk> and <unk> it.
And we're starting by <unk> the <unk> that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in the <unk>. That's our <unk>.
So what was a problem for this <unk>, what we did in our <unk>, and that will be the <unk> <unk> <unk> during this <unk>.
CA: But while you've been talking about different people in the world about this <unk>.
Where is the most <unk> interest, what really <unk>?
<unk>: Well, we haven't yet to go to a place, and there's a lot of <unk> <unk> for everything that's called "<unk>" in the name. There's big interest, and the people of the <unk> were in <unk>, India, China -- I was here, and I talked to the <unk>, and I talked about how it <unk> to the <unk>.
I'm a <unk>. You know, the <unk> and <unk> have something in the direction.
This is a <unk> of a thing that was made.
This is a very important step, but it's like a <unk> <unk>, and some countries have built this, so anybody who <unk> a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> for our first.
CA: In your imagination, <unk> and <unk> are something like that in life?
<unk>: So we need one of these <unk>, <unk> things that are very <unk>, we spent 20 years to <unk> and then 20 years to <unk>.
This is <unk> the <unk> that <unk> us the <unk> that we have to <unk>.
And, you know, <unk>, if everything goes well, and it's a big wish, it might be easy.
And <unk>, there are <unk> of companies today, and we need <unk> who, as if their <unk> work, <unk> the <unk> for their <unk>.
And it would be <unk> if they do multiple, because then you could use a <unk>.
<unk>, we need a solution.
CA: <unk> of the great possible <unk>, is that the <unk> you know?
<unk>: A <unk> is the <unk>.
It would have been without the <unk>, but it does so much more important.
In the <unk> <unk>, there are other <unk> companies.
You know, we don't know their work as well as these, but there's the <unk> <unk>, that's a different approach.
There's a <unk> <unk> that seems to be a little bit difficult, but maybe it's telling us.
And so, there's different, but the beautiful thing is that a <unk> is going to have a million times as much energy as a, say, a <unk>, and so, if you can deal with the problems, and that's <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> and the cost, <unk> the <unk>, so the impact on the country and other things, almost in your <unk>.
CA: If that didn't work, what then?
<unk> we <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> <unk>?
<unk>: When you get into this situation, it's as if you have too much <unk>, and <unk> in front of a <unk>. So what do you do? You might need a <unk> or a <unk>.
There's a <unk> called <unk>, which <unk> with different <unk> to <unk> the <unk>, so we <unk> 20 or 30 years to <unk>.
This is just one <unk>.
You know we don't need it.
Some people say, well, you don't want to be working on the <unk>, because you might go out and get <unk>, because you know that you're going to save the <unk>.
I don't know if the <unk> is, if you look at the <unk> of this <unk>, but there's a <unk> in <unk> about whether you should have that, if things come faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect.
CA: <unk>: Do you have one or two <unk> for <unk> to <unk> you?
<unk>: Well, unfortunately, the <unk> live in very different <unk>.
<unk> that make science <unk> are very little.
Did they say there are <unk> effects that have to do with the <unk> that <unk> things?
There are very, very few things that they can even tell, that there is a chance in a million.
The <unk> here is similar to AIDS.
You do the <unk> now, and you <unk> a lot later.
And so, the idea is, now, if you have all sorts of <unk> problems to invest in something you've just got to do about what has happened -- and to do that, the <unk> is not so clear. In fact, the <unk> is not necessarily <unk> the <unk>, and there are people in the rich world that look at <unk> and say, okay, that's not a big <unk>.
The fact is that these <unk> should worry about us.
But my dream here is that, if you can make it <unk>, and at the same time, the <unk> <unk>, then the <unk> say, "Okay, I don't really care that it doesn't <unk> <unk>, I almost <unk> it, because it's <unk> than the <unk> <unk>."
CA: And that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that if you use all of that time and energy to solve the <unk> problem, all the other <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> and so forth that it's a <unk> <unk> of resources to invest money for better things we can do.
<unk>: Well, the <unk> <unk> for the research -- let's say that <unk> should be 10 billion a year than they do today -- that's not that <unk>.
<unk> should not <unk> other things.
You get to big <unk>, and here you can get <unk> people, if you have something that's not <unk>, and trying to <unk> it, and for me, here's the <unk> <unk>.
It's because, you know, there's a <unk> in front of a <unk>, and just <unk> the <unk>, I think we should try more things that have the potential to be much more <unk>.
If the <unk> you get is a very <unk> <unk>, you can only <unk> the <unk>.
I mean, every one of us here could <unk> five times so much for our energy without changing his <unk>.
For the <unk> two billion, it's a <unk>.
And even <unk> thinks about it.
The new <unk> is, "Why is it that <unk> <unk> is not going to <unk> more?"
It will still be, because of his <unk> stories, with the <unk> <unk>, but he has understood that that's a very <unk> group, and that's why he's <unk> the <unk> now.
And this is a <unk> that I consider for <unk>.
<unk>, it's just crazy, how little it will be <unk>.
CA: Bill, I think I'm speaking for almost every person here, when I say, I really hope your wish will be true. Thank you so much.
<unk>: Thank you.
I'd like to tell you something a few months ago on a <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
I always <unk> my <unk>, but I was done with the <unk> of the <unk>, and I noticed that I had never <unk> in my life, which means "<unk>."
I'll tell you the <unk>.
<unk> , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk>: <unk>, strong, <unk>. "
I <unk> this list of a friend of <unk> <unk>, and I had to <unk> <unk>, it was so <unk>, but I got only to <unk>, and I couldn't go back to it, and I had to stop reading, and then <unk> <unk> for this <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Of course, this was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and I just thought that the <unk> must be pretty old.
But in fact, it was a <unk> in the early '<unk>, when I was working on the <unk> <unk> and I started <unk> my <unk> outside my <unk> and <unk> in terms of other kids and the <unk> world around me.
And thank God, I didn't use a <unk> at that time.
<unk> I take this <unk> seriously, I was born into a world that would <unk> someone like me as a person who could <unk> life in a <unk> way, but today but I am going to <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> I have <unk>.
So I immediately <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and I expect me to find a <unk> here.
Here's the <unk> version of this <unk>.
<unk>, it's not much better.
<unk>, the last two words under "<unk> <unk>" and "<unk>."
But it's not just the words.
It's about what we think about the people we describe with these <unk>.
It's about the values that are in these words, and how we <unk> these values.
Our language <unk> our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us.
Many <unk> societies, including the <unk> and the <unk>, have really <unk> that the <unk> of a <unk> has a big force, because what you can <unk> <unk> is also <unk>.
So what do we actually want to <unk> -- a <unk> person or a <unk> person?
Instead of having a human being <unk> as a child, <unk> might <unk>, <unk> them and <unk> them.
<unk> 't it be <unk> to open you <unk>?
A person who's been <unk> for me <unk> was my <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk>.
He's called Dr. <unk>. A <unk>, whose name, as you can think, most Americans couldn't <unk> <unk>. So he was always called Dr. <unk>.
And Dr. <unk> <unk> was always very <unk> and was just <unk> for children like this.
I found the time I spent in this hospital, just great -- up to my <unk>.
I had to <unk> the single <unk> <unk> <unk> often with these <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that's what you know to build my <unk>, and I have these <unk> more <unk> than everything else. I <unk> them. I <unk> them.
And imagine, I've been <unk> as a young child with Dr. <unk>, and so trying to <unk> this <unk>, <unk> without success.
And one day, he was watching me at one of my <unk> -- these <unk> were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me, "<unk>, <unk>, you're such a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> girl, you'll be one day of this <unk> <unk>.
And if you get it, I'll give you about <unk> dollars. "
This was, of course, a simple <unk> of Dr. <unk>, so I make the <unk> that I didn't want to do, with the <unk> that <unk> <unk> girls are in the <unk> in the second <unk>, but he actually brought me to see my <unk> <unk> with new eyes, and that's how it became a new and <unk> <unk>.
And I wonder how much his vision of me as <unk> and <unk> <unk> girl has <unk> my <unk>, and I could imagine as one of nature from <unk>, <unk> and <unk> person.
This is just one example of many, like <unk> in <unk>, can <unk> the <unk> of a <unk>.
But like most <unk> examples from the <unk> <unk>, our language doesn't have a room to <unk> something that we would all <unk> to: it will be <unk> to each other, to see themselves as <unk> people.
Our language <unk> the <unk> changes that have been <unk> by a <unk> change in many cases.
Of course, <unk> <unk> 's <unk>, you can say that my legs, the <unk> for <unk>, <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> bodies that allow people to really use their <unk> and <unk> across the <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> <unk> to develop, not to speak of <unk> <unk> <unk>, people can give themselves to be their own identity, to <unk> in their own way, in their own way,
And it's moving to groups around the world that they <unk> themselves.
So, maybe <unk> this <unk> change, because the fact that there was a different truth, which is that every person in society can <unk> something quite <unk> and very <unk>, and that the human ability to <unk>, our <unk> <unk>.
The human ability to <unk> -- that's an interesting story, because people always always ask me to tell me about how I <unk> with <unk>, and I'll tell you something: this sentence has never been <unk> to me, and I've always been very <unk> to <unk> the questions of people, and I think <unk> <unk> me why.
This sentence from the <unk> with <unk> lives with the idea that success or <unk> of <unk> <unk> a challenge without being <unk> with <unk> <unk>, as if my life would be so successful, because I could <unk> the possible <unk> of a life with a <unk>, or whatever people are <unk> me with my <unk>.
But the truth is that we change. Of course, we are <unk> by the challenge, whether it's <unk>, <unk> or even <unk>.
And I <unk> that this is good.
<unk> are not <unk> that we have to <unk> to get better with our lives.
<unk> are simple to our lives.
And I <unk> to see <unk> as my <unk>.
Sometimes I realize it's very <unk>, sometimes it's not to see it, but it's constantly with me.
And I want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a human being.
There are <unk> in life and challenges, and they're just <unk> <unk>, and they're just <unk>, and each person is different about it, but the question is not whether we're getting <unk> with <unk> or not, but how we get it.
So we are not just responsible for the people we love to <unk> <unk>, but they also <unk> to get good.
And we don't teach our kids to <unk> if we give them the feeling that they can't <unk>.
You have to <unk> two things: to one of the medical fact, to be <unk>, and to the other, the <unk> <unk> of whether I am <unk> or not.
And to be honest, the only <unk> and <unk> <unk> that I had to <unk> with, is that the world is constantly <unk>, <unk> me with these <unk>.
In our desire to protect people who are on the heart, and to give them the <unk>, <unk> truth about their medical <unk>, or even <unk> a <unk> for <unk> that they're <unk> to do, we have to <unk> that we don't have the <unk> to be <unk>.
Maybe the <unk> concept is just <unk> to what's in a <unk>, and how we <unk> it, for each one of them as the <unk>.
When we don't treat a human <unk>, and not all of his forces and <unk> and <unk>, we create <unk> to the natural <unk> that they might have to lead, another disease.
We <unk> a person who has a value for our society.
So we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the <unk> of human <unk>.
But what's interesting about <unk> is that, between the <unk> of our <unk> and our <unk> <unk>, there is a connection.
We should not <unk> those <unk> times or <unk>, we should not try to <unk> them, we should be <unk> them under the <unk>, but it's about <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
I think it may be more likely to <unk> that we don't have to <unk> <unk>, but that we're open to <unk> them, <unk> them at the <unk> <unk>, to use a <unk> and maybe even <unk> with it.
And maybe we'll be able to see <unk> as something more <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and don't feel so through their <unk>.
In this year, we <unk> the 200. <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and when he wrote about evolution <unk> years ago, <unk>, in my view, <unk> on something very <unk> in the human <unk>.
I would <unk> it: not the <unk> of his kind of <unk>, and not the <unk> of its kind, but the one that can change change in the best <unk>.
<unk> <unk> creativity.
Not just from <unk> <unk>, we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk>, from the <unk> of human <unk>, <unk> by <unk>.
So, <unk>, change and <unk> are the <unk> <unk> of the people.
And maybe we just know that we're <unk> from <unk> when we really become <unk>.
<unk> is exactly the sense of <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>, a sense of our own <unk>.
We can do something like this.
We can make a new meaning that goes beyond <unk> times.
Maybe we can see <unk> as change.
<unk>, for a change that we haven't been involved in.
I think the biggest <unk> we've <unk> ourselves is to believe that we should be normal.
<unk>, who's normal?
There's no <unk>.
There's the <unk>. That's the <unk>. But not the <unk>. And would you really want to know this <unk>, <unk> person, if it really <unk>?
I don't think so much.
It would be great if we <unk> this <unk> of <unk> against a different <unk> or <unk>, to even <unk> it a little bit more <unk>, more <unk>, so we can <unk> the forces of very many children and <unk> them to <unk> their very <unk> and <unk> skills to society.
<unk> have found out that humans from the <unk> of our society always have an <unk>: <unk> and <unk> a <unk>.
There's evidence that the <unk> <unk>, <unk> years ago, people and people with <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and that might happen because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people were <unk> for society.
They didn't look at these people as <unk> and <unk>; they were treated as something <unk> and <unk>.
A few years ago, I went to the city where I was <unk> in a <unk> in <unk> 's "<unk> <unk>" in the <unk> of <unk>, and I was standing there in front of a <unk>.
It was summer, and I had <unk>.
And I <unk> the guy behind me, "Well, if that's not enough <unk>."
And I sat around and see this <unk> man. I had no idea who he is.
And I'm like, "<unk>, <unk>, do you know? I can't remember you."
And he said, "Well, you <unk> 't remember me.
When I saw you, I <unk> you from the <unk> of your mother. "
Oh, yeah.
And of course, then it did <unk>.
This was Dr. <unk>, a man I just <unk> out of my mother's <unk> on this day, because I, of course, <unk>, <unk> two weeks to <unk>.
The doctor for <unk> <unk> was in <unk>, and so my parents <unk> the man who brought me to the world at all.
And because I was born without <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> after them, and I just had some <unk> on this, and some <unk> at the other foot, he was the <unk>, this <unk> had to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
He said to me, "I've had to say <unk> parents that you never walk, and never <unk> as <unk> as other children, or you've never got a <unk> life, and you've just got me <unk> <unk>."
<unk> <unk>, I found that he <unk> <unk> of my entire childhood, no matter whether I was <unk> at a <unk> in the second <unk>, whether I was <unk> with the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk>, no matter whether I had <unk> my <unk> or one of my <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> these <unk> to <unk> his students from the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And he called that part of his <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the human <unk>.
It's simply not enough how <unk> this <unk> can be for people's <unk>.
And Dr. <unk> <unk>, he said, "I've learned that kids, if they don't say something else, and also when they get a little bit of support, when you <unk> kids, then kids can achieve much."
You see, Dr. <unk> has changed his thinking.
He had understood that the medical <unk> <unk> and how someone <unk> with it, two different things.
And also, I was <unk> my thinking at the <unk> of time, if they asked me at the age 15 years, whether I would have <unk> my <unk> against legs from <unk> and <unk>, I would have no second <unk>.
I didn't want to <unk> normal at the time.
If you ask me that today, I'm not so sure.
And that's what happened, I've seen something with my <unk>, and not <unk> of this <unk>.
And maybe that change could happen because I'm so many people who have <unk> me <unk>, rather than <unk> people who wanted me to <unk> me or give me an idea.
You see, it's really just a person to tell you how to <unk> your forces, and you are through.
If you allow someone to <unk> your own, <unk> forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that, and for someone in a <unk> moment, you're a very good teacher for those people.
They bring them to <unk> themselves.
The <unk> meaning of the word "<unk>" in the word "<unk>."
It means something that's in a <unk>, which is <unk>.
<unk>: So what are we going to do?
In the <unk> years, in <unk>, they did a <unk>, and they <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
They call this "<unk> <unk>" in the United States, we call this as "<unk>."
<unk> are <unk> to <unk>.
And the A student will <unk> <unk> <unk>, the better teachers and so on.
They then have a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a "<unk>" the <unk>, "<unk>," they said they were very <unk>, and after those three months, she really wrote <unk>.
And of course, it <unk> to hear the heart that <unk> said the <unk>, they were just <unk>.
And then it was like three months.
But only those who were still in school -- <unk> by the <unk> that the school had <unk>.
What was interesting about this study was that teachers weren't <unk>.
<unk> didn't know something was <unk>.
They were simply told that they were the <unk>, and they are the students with the <unk> <unk>, and they're the same as they were treated with them and they <unk> them.
The only <unk> <unk> is a <unk> mind that was <unk>, has no hope. He <unk> nothing more <unk> to <unk> our natural, <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to <unk>.
But if we create the human mind to <unk>, <unk> and other people around themselves to find beautiful, <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk> our forces to really <unk>.
If a spirit <unk> about these <unk>, we can create a new reality and new <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with a <unk> that was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> named <unk> in the <unk> century, and I was told by my friend <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> is called "The God who <unk> only four words." "<unk> <unk> knows God, not the <unk> of the name, not the God of <unk>, but the God who <unk> only four words, but the God who only <unk> up only four words, and he just says," <unk>, <unk> with me. "
<unk>, <unk> with me. Thank you.
