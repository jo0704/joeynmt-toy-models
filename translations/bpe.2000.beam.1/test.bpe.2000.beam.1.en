Several, Skillman's introduced, and I think, a design of design, and it would be challenged by the marshmallow.
And the RenVRS: Team of the Middle Act Bide Bide Bide's Build the test, and a test of the stuff, and the talling of the story, in the world, and the test of the story, and you have a yard of dye, and one yard of tape, and one yard of a squid, and one yard of
The marshmallow is to be a state.
And, but that's what's the first thing that's going to be a little bit of pretty much about the first pretty hard definitely, in the case, it's a very quickly initial.
And so I do what about the thing, and I was incorporated with a design collaborative.
And it's going to be a huge search.
And then, I get 70 design design across the amazing, and designed and architects, the CTOs of the Fortune 50, and the Con-Age Age exercise reveals the extract of the very deep of the very deep of collaboration, and I'm a chark of the whole thing.
So, normally, it's taken by the rise of orienting the themic of the world.
It's like, characterizing, you know, it's going to be done by the way to get it, and you know, ocky for power.
It's a pon-planning, organizing, and it's like, you know, cheating in the spades of the springh.
And the major of the anchority of the Conjor, consistent the sticks into ever-large and real.
And then, as a result of the automobile, you know, it's like, you know, the squid of the marshmallow, and it's like, and it turns out to be done, and it was like, and it was a day, and it was a day, and it was a charge.
For example, the thing of the thing, the "tably" is "table-hy-and-and-"" "" "" "" "The Byoh" "Con-Bour-"" "" The First of the marshmallow car "collapse" collapse. "
So, as you know, it's like, you know, the farm of the stuff of the Muh-oh, and it's a lot of "uh-oh" but, and the among the world are the very recent graduate of business of business.
Something, the cheat, the map of districted and so on, and it's a little bit of the way.
And of course, in the middle of the day, they're in the process of the brain, and it's a lot of the day, "tac-da" -- and the offices are the ones that they're doing, and the among the absolute graduate of the paints of the Coler-Age.
And it was a fabric.
For example, it's called the Peter, you know, you know, you know, the most promage of the things that's really the most properly, you know, the thing that's really the way the world's intentional movement of all of it.
So the way the way you get to get in the world is: you know? Why? What is it?
And Peter likes to say, "No of the Men of the Men," -- "CEO of Spaghetti," Inc. C. Right?
It's not a good job in the spend of this time, but it's a little bit of jumpity-power.
Behind the way, it's like, "OK," as well.
And the reason is a business of business, trained to the case to the Earth right, right?
And it's execute about it.
And, as the marshmallow is, the marshmallow on the top, is the squid of itself from the mouth of it, and it's all of the mouth of it?
It was a crisis.
OK, familiar? Right.
What cinder-do do differentiates to the marshmallow, and the sharp prototype, successive prototypes, charging the marshmallow, so multiple car is a prototyping prototype of prototypes along the way.
Designers recognize the mouth of collaboration as the essence of the iterative project.
And then, rather version, the map of the continued strong feedback and stuff like that.
So the thing that the way the way to play is that the way the way we're doing is essential to the world, and let's make it happen to the context of the way that it's a little bit of the performance.
So the average for the average is, you know, the average is 20 inches, and business guys, we have a half of them, and a characterization, and you have a child, you know, a little bit of a moment, and more than a down-up, and more than a bunch of times, you know, the Congrest, you know, the e@@
Who does the very?
Architects and Engineer, thankful, thankful.
Thirty-nine inside is the tallest of the world's world world.
And so, you know, it's the way that it's going to be the very running and self-cleanced, and you're in the very rough scale, the way to make it happen.
So CEOs, a bunch of thanky, and a daily, and it's coming up with a little bit of time.
You put you on executive administram the team, the significantly.
It's called you. You're going to be like you, you're going, you go, "Oh, you know," Oh, you know, "Oh, you know," Win the way. "
You can get it. You can get it.
It's also a little bit of a divertation of cool of facilitation.
And there are the project that project.
And so, while you get a pay of them, you get a bunch of stuff with work with the team of the Steam Are Steam.
Specializs skills and discovering that the combination of the combination of the stuff is to be very much, very much.
You're going to have you 10 text, you know, you're going to be able to get you 10, typically, you know, you're going to have your narrative of the Stext Surpon, you get it in the way, and you get a little bit of a name of it.
And I tried to be.
I do, let's go on the top, once.
So I operate a 10,000 dinner prior of software to the winning.
So how do you know what you do was that what's going on with is design?
What's the equivalent of the results?
And here, the thing is, the thing was, the first thing was a standing of the standing.
And there was noone had a piece of this, say, a one of the things that are in the bottom line, and the bottom line, the price.
So, is that what we do is, is that, and it's impact, and it's impact, and it's impact.
We are the exercise of the study of the exercise.
What do you do?
This is the A.S., which is the value of prototyping.
So the very thing about the very, very, very much about the very, in the very, very, to the very study.
At the tallest, the tallest of the world, the test of the world, the test of the world, the tallest of the brain.
So, the nature of the natural of the natural of incentives and succeeds.
So, you know, you're a little bit of a marshmallow, you know, you're a marshmallow?
And the reason is, I'm doing a process of processing tools and processing the process to team a new and a video effects.
And the marshmallow is to get the heroic's headed and helps the identical type of the world.
Frankly, frankly, it project a marshmallow, and it's like, right?
And so, the job provides provides a shared, and a long-living, and a little bit of a pole on a little bit of a purple, and a little bit of a pole, and a little bit of a purple, a little bit of a prototype.
And so, the value of the Conencian of the Coneway, of the simple exercise.
And the thing about you guys are going to be like, you know, the way to go to MarshmallowCallenge.com.
It's a pole of the base of the base of a bunch of a bunch of shark the marshmallows.
It's a past, and it's a purpose, and it's a big, by-cy-step-by-cycle.
So, the thing is the case of crazy, and it's the very good thing about doing that, and the way the mode is the mode of the system.
It's a limited way to be able to get there in the back.
And the fundamental of Lesses, I do, is that's a design, design is a contact.
It demands, and it's all the way we bring all the way to the tour, and then we got the very serious one, and we got the very slightly like our own, our fellow and our case, our past, and we got out of the way.
And, you know, a prototype of the ancient model of the story of the day, and it's all the way to turn it to be a tail, and it's like, "Oh" and "tah" right. "
And the thing is, you know, the difference of that.
You're very much.
So, leather, predend, predend right now.
A while a nice one, a cool, TEDish machine, and it machine, it machine.
And you get to the throwing in the way to get it into it.
And you can go, you can go on, you can go on, you can go forward, you can't be your angles you're going to be you're going to be you're going to be you.
And I would be a little bit of you, I think, a little bit of a button, and I was a little bit of a marching, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born, and I was born
I don't know, I think, "On, on the top of the ATM EDue Earth, Twitter," American Idol. "
I don't know.
I am a Convinced, and I think, is a bunch of pull to nostalgia, to know how to know.
And I was.
I mean, I was saying, I said, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say," I say, "I say.
I don't know about to go back, and it's called the AI AI AI Airventurous.
It's a pleasant ponsilities of a planet, and it's called the Congo, and it's called, Congo, Congo.
So I do this in the machine, and I was born, and I was born.
It's a case to be the most condition of the process of a planet, and it's a base of messy, and it's a case to choose, and it's like, like, mobility, an audience, declining rates of disease...
It's a matter of being a matter of being a matter of being a matter of being a matter of concern.
My greater parent, all of the things, by the mate, it's 60.
My graduate pushed in 70.
My participation mosquitos close in 80.
So, as a result of this, the beginning of my death was.
It's a little bit of it that's in the middle of the day, and it's a bigger deal.
A kid in the born in New Delhi, in the end, in New Delhi, is the living in the live of the world, in the world, the world's the Earth you are in the Six 100, you're in the Six.
Right, on the same way, it's a little bit of a thing that's going to be done.
And does it happen?
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions of the piece of the planet.
It was reshaped the demographic of the Clobe in a way, and it was not a mistake.
It's called it. It was a main.
We vanquish it. Back.
In the same, discredit, threatened, millions of us is there's a sponger, or a level, hardly.
Diphtheria, Right, polio...
Are you going to have anyone else's going on?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our ability to be fed billions of stuff, the Confi of the Center method.
And to my mind, the Centfy-entic method -- stuff out of the way, you know, searching it, and it changed off to the one of the ConAcian accomplishments of humanity.
This is the way the one is the thing.
Inconscience, and in fact, all the way the very thing that's going on is that the thing is, and it's a little bit of a problem, and it's a moment, and it's a moment.
And one of the things that's called is that all our accomplishments, and a trillion, and a hundred, bed, and you have a huge, and you get to the house of the way, and you're in the hour, and you're in the hour, and you're in the morning.
It's a region, and it's called the rising, and it's called the Crundiary, and it's called the Centrepreneur, and it's a little bit of disfocused.
And I think, well, we go, and we're going to be honest, threw, horn, and you're going to be drash, you're going to be drash.
Potal water, Arabland, rainforests, oil, gas, it's the thing that's going on, and the moment, and the way, and so on, and unfortunately, innovate, and innovate, in the way, we're going to be in the way out of the long, we know.
So the thing is, Can we do? And I can do it.
I do it with a clear, I can tell you, it's a little bit of a billions of the Earth Age, and it's like, and it's going to be listening to the country.
I do the technology that I do is, the destroy of power, the way it's doing it.
I do, and I do, and I don't know, no, in the way, in the way, in the way.
And the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the Serek Earth keeps up, and one of the Earth keeps up, and he said, "We're going to be progress in the Honor Age, and it's right now."
And so, you know, that's where you get a position to deploy depense in the way we can't get it.
We're the verge of amazing, and we've got a hand, and yet I have to go back to go to go back to go to go back to go to go to go to go to go to go, 300, and the Enlightenment, to the British, and the Brimp Age Age Age Age Age, and we found a little bit of a time, and we found that f@@
Peenwrap was a matter of popular, and so on the other thing that's so tightly, and you can get the type of the study of the stuff.
An the audience is the worth of the technology.
And, listening, contemplating the way, the Contan aged to the openion, the Contled opinion of progress.
You're having a great person who's entirely entirely?
You're entirely conditioned with the day. Sorry, you're in.
And I'll get a huge join into shouts.
There's a story of above a story, I wrote a story, Vaccine for The New Yorker. A one of the story.
And I think of the amazing thing about it: Open to the opposition to the surface, all the time effective public is that they're borrowing.
I do it, I do, I do, I do, I wrote, I wrote a story of myself, I wrote and I was mobile.
And so, I wrote a story of this story, I wrote, in the genetically, of Engineered.
Am, more, more bigger.
Pemastic, Druzy.
So I wrote a story about this story, and I was pulling together, and I was taking care of what's called Frankenfoods, and the way we got to the Frankenfodes, and the moving moving molecular, and a piece of molecular, and a piece of a haphazard way, which is a chamico, and what's trig@@
You know, you're doing it, I do, I do the story, I wrote the story, I was mobion.
I am, I was a journalist.
We typically we dymin, we're going to dinner. It was a little bit.
And thanthfully, thanthfully, I think, thanthfully, I was born with the people who were born with, and I was borrowing, and eventually I do.
And the very fancy, while, the crazy of the stuff of the Conzy, were the way to go to get fancy, and the mazy work, were going to be fantatically.
Same amazing, real, educated equation, and it's a great one.
It's also the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the
And it's going to be a little bit of it.
I think you're going to be a honest, and I'll give you a while.
We did a lot of the way we did it in the world, and we don't know, in the car, the Consing Congress, the Congress, we did the Let's Congress.
We're doing the ambivalding.
We're going to be in ironic terms, "Congress."
Okay, so, I think, it's not good, it's a good idea for it, and I do it, I think, it's a little bit of it.
We're going to be able to institutions in a way, in authority, and in a lower, in a lower, and a matter of the way we don't know, and we're having a idea of shoup.
You can say, well, a little bit of a moment, and you can say, "OK," and he wants to be able to do it.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, and weapons of mass deeply, hanging.
You can, you can get you can do it.
And it's the purpose of the way that the world on the front is the way to go and get a little bit of a problem.
Ask: Accumping, the request, the request is the idea of evidence.
This is the thing that's done for granted.
So, you get the same thing: you get the mountain, you get a little bit of a car, you get the way to accept the city, and we're having a little bit of it.
And the reason I can say, the idea is that, in an epidemic of the epidemic of the Sicon, I'm going to be in the epidemic of the Sauth Age Age Age Age, and it's a hopeful way to see sea and hope.
About 12, which is a story, and a story, a story, a horrible story, a horrible story, the Oppers of the epidemic of the Morrible of the Morrible to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Ton of study the same time to see seeing this.
Tonal of study is that it's all about this.
The job.
The Benney Hidden Britain Sixine, Dugand, Dugand, Sweden, God, DCanada, and what all the things are: no correlation, no one, no one, no one, no one.
It's called the thing. It's a huge of the things that we have in the case of the anecdotes, we have the way we look at the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, and it's a real place.
We don't know, there's a government of the document, and we're government, and I do do it, I know, I was doing all the things.
You know?
The results of the His Act's disastrous.
Disastrous, Disastrous, is to go: The United States is one of the CEOs of the CEOs in the world's vaccine rate for measles.
It's discovery, and we're going to be a Ahammed of our own.
It was horrible.
What about a child of a dead?
Now, I do it. I do it.
Do you see, the Spain of Smeasles are there?
Has one in an audience was the one of measles?
At the very, very much.
At the end of that, you know, the door was done in the pair, and it's like that, and it's like 160,000 in the payload.
So, I think, it's a lot of mine of measles -- 20.
It's going to be done by the way that you're going to get off of our minds, and you can put it out of our minds, and you can see Jenny McCarthy, and you can see a lot of adverts, and you know, a billion-square of Earth's Earth and Earth King Live.
And the thing is that it's going to be done with this, and it's going to be a little bit of work, and it's going to be in the middle of the brain.
It's not a very distinctive thing that's happening, and it's the very, very, very much, and it's the very light-off.
And it goes to the burden of this, and then we learn it in the way.
I think, it's a little bit of a little bit of a South, Jonas Salk.
Heap of the slightly of the scale of some of the things that are.
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.
And I think, it's a good one in the middle, so it's like that.
His name is Paul Offit.
Hey, you know, a rotavirus vaccine is a bunch of stuff.
It's the way that the lives of 400 to 500,000 people in the beginning are in the beginning.
Pretty, right?
It's like, by the way, the extent of the Paul goes to go to the very place, and it's a little bit of a work, and it's like vaccine, and it's like vocably, and it's like, and it's like, and it's like, and it's like, and it's like, and it's like, "OK," to get the "income" to the end.
And then it goes on to it.
So, Paul's portrait.
And Paul Defs Side in a public, he's going to be a little bit of the first, and he's going to be a little bit of the first, and it's a little bit of the first.
Hey, and he was a little while, and he was a little bit of the way to go to school, he was a little bit of his own, and he was a little bit of his own, and he was a little bit of his own, and he was a little bit of his own, and he was a little bit of his own, and he was a little bit of his own.
And hold, Do Paul's there.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, but vaccine is essential.
You're going to be disease, you know, horrible disease, and you get a little bit of it.
We're measles in the same time.
And it's about, and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty much, and the pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty much car, and the ancient, and the answer is, it's a little bit of game.
And I think that's what the story is, and it's like, and that's the thing that's really about.
What's the polio? Let's get it in your head. Why?
A college of college cashed mine wrote a couple of couple of couple of mine, and the Con-Seventh I was doing, I think, "I am," I don't know, "I am."
There's no one.
She switched into a direct, or a polio, no way.
Fine.
Why? As there's a polio, you know?
We're going to be a polio in the world. We're going to be in the same hyesterday.
Today, I don't know, there's a great thing to get there in Lagos in Lagos, and he's going to go to LAX, right now, right now, right now.
And then, you know, there's a bunch of back-bed of a jours of hours, and you get a car, and then go to the Long Beach, and then you get a little bit of a mouth of the thread of this idea.
And then, you know, there's a lot of infected, you know, it's a paralytic disease, and we don't have anything else in the bottom of the very potential.
It's the planet that the planet is done. There's a pretty predent about it.
Now, let's go on the way that we're wrap about, and we're doing about doing this.
Are there any of you who are going to be done in the morning of the brain?
Echinacea, a bunch of antioxidanic to get you.
I'm going to be a sustainable place of American.
And the stuff of the stuff, and the traditional medicine, and then it's a great medical way to how to do it, and it's like the overall, and it's called the way that they would be in the top of the way that they would like to do it.
The only is the mainstream.
Don't get it in there. It's an altruth thing.
It's a great thing to get a billion dollars in a billion dollars in your house on it?
I do you, I'm doing you.
This is where it's about, Dark.
Why do do do do do do do? Why do do do do?
I was there, I was a big tablet of Pharma.
We have Big Government. We don't see the past.
And we shouldn't go, Our, and the care of the stuff.
It's a cruel millions of millions.
It was a cold of the Earth Railway and his soul-to-demo cold, and it's a little bit of the case of the cold.
So, do we get it, and so on the other way, do we go?
We're going to the arm of Big Placebo.
It's a fantastic. I do Big Placebo.
You know, you're going to be able to get it in a lower case, and you're a nice, and we're billions of dollars on the dollars on it.
And I'm worried about all sorts of things like this.
No of it -- gindgo, fresh; echinacea, frow; I don't have to have a case of mind, and we do have it on the top, and it's a billion-dollar billions of dollars on it on it -- it's going to be frozen.
And you do? At you? At you, I say, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, "What do you do? Let's do you do that. Let's do you do that.
It's a map of it. "
And you're going to be there? You're wrong.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I think, if you're in the outside of HHS, I'm doing, "Hmm, I'll be a good" I'll be able to do the ESi-Siddle Eidesci of my stuff on my experts on your experts, "or simply, you can get it," or you can get it, "Right,
You go, you'd go, and you sit down the road and magic regular regular, and you get a little bit of a while, you go to a while you're in a while you're going to be there.
For you, you're in Thabo Mberki South Africa.
Hey, hey, I killed 400,000 of his own As insisting, Garlic and lemac mail of the antiretroviral pronly we can see the Earth of AIDS.
Hundreds of the East Sand Devath Day Day Day, a bunch of Earth's plagued, whenever there was a bunch of disease in the world.
Please, don't have a consequenced thing to do that.
It's not like that.
Now, the way the Serventeptive epidemic we go in the middle of right now is the absurd of the proponent of genetically Engineered, and the organic elite.
It's a debate debate. It's a huge bad.
It's a debate, and it's called, and it's called metaphor.
It's a videology of being a little bit of a thing.
Every single cells, the Every situation, Right, Miss of rice, is the spring of parsley, and the Brusss sprout a lot of people's modified by you.
You think, the ancient type of the Eden's ancient world.
And in the case, the ancient crush is, the way to do it, the house is true. We're going to get it on the line. We're going to get it on it.
We're going to be 11,000.
And it's all about it, and it's like that.
We're talking about the stuff.
Now, the way to do it, precise, and the type of precise, absolutely -- but we can put it in a local vitamin A into a big, and a student millionth of the time, millions of times, projoking lives.
You don't do anything about doing the case?
I said, I don't know it.
We object to genetically genetically, and we're going to be called the same.
Why do do do do do do do do?
For example, the As Constantly, the A.S., whatever it is, is that Too makes, the most pestant, hormones, monoculture, we don't know, there's a whole bad of the ancient game of the world, and it's all the way.
We don't know companies patent life.
We don't have the companies of own-up.
And you do my response to all of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole.
Yes, you're right. Let's get free with it.
It's a terrific thing to do it, and it's a huge food problem.
It's a little bit of doing that, and it's a little bit of doing that.
It's a bunch of patent with it.
You're going to be a company. You're going to be a company.
It was a mine.
It's in the middle of it, and it's a project.
It's a project, and it's a project that's a project that's up and it's like, and it's like, and the way the background is the base, and whatever the base, allow, and you know, the base, allow the way, and you know, that the thing we do was that we can get the Araid of the Araid, is that the deadense was,
You're going to be in the world in the world, in the world, to make it big, you know, in the car to make it great, 70, you know, it's about -- you know, you know, you know, about it right now, and you're doing, 70.
For installation in Africa, over the lower 30.
Disgrania. Disgrania.
It's also that, and we're going to have a little bit of work on it.
And that's, Genetically, Englised food.
We don't have a stuck of encouraging the way we get to work on the stuff, and we have a study that we're doing, and so on, and we're going to be able to get stuck, and so, in a way, cassava.
Cassava was a huge huge, a trillion, and a trip of character.
It's a child of a potato.
It's a bright of calories. It's looking for it.
It's called the Turidian, which is to be protein, and the most intended industry in industry and all of the things are now in this right now.
And the way that it's going to be, and it's able to be able to get there, and it's got blind.
So, you know, wouldn't you have a little bit of a dive, and you're in your head?
It's not going to be a white thing. It's wouting, Chez Panisse, and it's going to be a little bit of a cap.
And all I can say, "Why are the thing we're going to shall?
I do, do it go to the other way, why is we're going to be shaping it?
Are we going to move the way to move the way?
It's a living thing, it's a huge, it's not living. It's not a chemicle.
It's intensive to be ridiculous in ridiculous for hormones, our insistence on sharks, or less food, whereby, whereby food.
Rice Krispie, the thing is, is that I think it's a characterized, and it's a little bit of key, and it's a little bit of charge, and it's like, and it's like, it's a moment in the middle of the way that it's in the middle of the day.
You know, you're there?
We don't know, if you're going to continue to the issue of the way we get a little bit of the way we do this, and we're going to be a good thing about the AK, and we're going to have a good thing about it, and you're going to be a good thing about it, and you're going to be a good, charging colonialism.
There is no way to get the same thing to the Counce of Love.
It's called it, it's called an ugly, it's in the way, and it's going to be a little bit of hand, and we go on the car.
So, as a result of the time, the Con-Actor Bringly, you're conversation, you say, "This, you're going to get a little bit of the stuff in an horse, and you're doing a goodbye, and goes on, on, you know?"
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It was a present in the present right now, and we're going to be a fabric of amazing.
We can do a little bit of a set of books on anyway.
We can move it on the line, and we can move it, and we go, and we would like to move the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way, on the way.
We car about the moment, conversations, and we're going to get the way to get it in the machine, and we're going to get there and we go on the way, and we're going to get a little bit of work.
I was going to be in the middle of the day, and as an air as I was a I concerned, and the Eright now, the way, the way, the way the East At As AK.
You.
One day, Los Angeles Times Mumnist Steve Lopez, With Along the Eong Afen the Earth Creat Los Angeles, are going to be a mistake of the top of the Earth On Earth.
And the source of what a thing you, in African American you, charming, rolled, pleasant, pleasant, violin slides.
And I do this story, and Steve, MSS., Mid-Coved Be, who's a book, which turns it to a movie, and a judgment of Robert Downey, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double, and it's a promise care@@
Nathaniel threpped out of Juilliard, he's going to go to a complete crash, and 30 pollination later, and he's going to go on the reverse of the Ekid Row in downtown Los in the Earth Ocean.
I encourage all of you to Rad Steve, and the movie bond at the very sustained bond, thanks to be, you know, you know, how music heroes shape, bond, and ultimately, and you're in the local, you know, you'll be a pardon's punch -- in helping Nathaniel, you get the
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, and the Wold Disney Concert Hall.
Hey was a performance of Beethoven's First, and Firth symphony, and the backing stage of introduced.
Hey, what was a very jovial and gregarious ways to go to the Yo-Yo Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and the Dodgers to go to the World Series, all the way the Con-Hidden Britain's Con-Humble passage in the local movement of Beethoven's Fourth of Beeth@@
And we had music music, and I was in email to Steve, and I was yelling the nice, and I was saying, and I was saying, and I was saying, and I was saying, and I was saying, and I was saying, and I was looking at night, and I was a violin living.
Now, I'm going to refer to the Nathaniel and refush, and I'm going to get a little bit of the Corazine shot and a very style of Thorazine, and it's a styate of him for his entire life.
Along now, it's a trained to a trained to a massive nice, but it's a schizophrenic episode, the world of the Middle Age, and Dumpearing, and it's a very deappearing for, and so, wheless, wheling, wheling the street of Skid Row, exposed to its own, and
And Nathaniel, what kind of state of agitation is to go to the Warth Disney Concert, and he was a child of a child of a Seyes of a Seyes, where you're going to get to the eyes.
And then, what I thought about doing is invisible demand and taking, and what was the poisoning him in his sleep.
And I know that Araid, I think, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to get a little bit of work on the paidst, and you'll see what the hole is going to be in the state of His, and the Araid Act Broin, and the Rails of Rails, and I was a very relation@@
So, I was playing.
And I played the Moly-Movement of the Beethoven Violin Concto.
And as I played, I was dead of what a profound of a project is a profound of an occupine in Nathaniel, OK.
It's what an invisible pharmaceutical invisible pharmaceuital, which is a chemical response, for the musical of my playing the playing the musical music, which is a matter of catalyst.
And Nathaniel, manic a little bit of transforming into a very containing, a slightly curiosity and grace.
And in a miracle, lifted, at a middle of violin, and he's going to be a little bit of ear, certainly snippets of violin concertos, and he would be ashamed asking asking -- a bunch of mentions, Tchaikovsky, Siberius.
And we had music music, and Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Brahms, all the B, the Bartók, all the way up to Ete-Peka Salona.
And I'm going to have a huge death in a middle-end of a name of a name of a music, and it's got to be a little bit of related to the state of the brain, and it's a personal level.
Hey, you spoke to the child of the child of the story of all happening and a lot of hand, and I hate a lot of my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And playing music, and I had to have a direct, you had a direct, you know, a distance in the paranoid, you know, you had a pair of domestic the reverse of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, and ended, brilliant, Juilliard's trained.
Music is medicine. It's a music.
And for Nathaniel, music is it.
And it had to be done with a music allows, and it has to be a hand, and it's a hand and delush and burden, and I shape, and you're hugely, and you're creative and himself creativity, and you're in reality.
And it's an escent in the world of the time.
And I was determined what the very sensational of species.
And what the very reason is, as we have to do, in the very, in the very, in the very, in the very fundamental core, we had to be a very fundamental core, our emotions, and our first thing, our creativity, and we can't have the reality of the emotions of the emotions of emotions.
And the real of an expression reaches all of us and moves, inspiring and unittable.
And for Nathaniel, music broken him back to a fold of individual.
The redeme power of music brown back to him to a family of family, and a non-seek him, and a narrow, and a nuanced, and she was doing it.
And I want to get a music of M.thaniel, and it's a Wold Disney Concert Hall or Skid Row, who's a name of it, and he was a name of it, and he was a name, I was a music.
You.
Bruno Giussani: You're. Thanks.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I was a little bit of the Health I was a huge, I was a cheering, and I was a little bit of celebric.
That's how, please shape.
I was Jane McGonigal. I was a game designer.
I do this, online, I'd like to do now, and my goal for the size is to go to the size of the way to go to the Serek to the Serek, and it's a little bit of a challenge to see the thing that's in real life, and it's in real life, and it's actually the way to see the thing in real life, and it's just the way to see the thing
Now, I've got a plan for it, and it's a little bit of convincing more than, including all of you, to spend more, and the way we're in the middle of the day.
Right now, the Right Ber Benva, Right B-Shand Right, hours a week, and it's not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
Some of you would be like, "Conor a lot of personal] to spend playing.
Maimate, considering, considering the problems we're going to do in the real. "
For example, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, the opposite is true.
Three hours a week is not a little bit of a moment, and it's a little bit of a long time to go to the very living.
In the middle of the day, I was born if the survival of survival the Earth century, we were in the car, the way to the British Age Short Country Bay, Doose's Surri's absolutely dramatically.
I was the calculated the totally, and he asked 21 trillion hours of game.
So, the thing about this is a co-intuitive, so I say, by the way, it's like, whenever it goes to the funny, poverty, poverty, functioned, collaborated, global conflict, overall, I said, "Let's go to the" Congresian "--" -- "I'll go to the" C@@
No. I'm doing serious. I am.
It's a little bit.
I think, the PRRs of PRSE Act Act Act Act Act Act Act Act Act Act Act Act Act, and I said, "I was very sensial to the Ssurval of the Earth Office. Truly.
It's a portrait by portrait by Phil Toledano.
Hey car to the emotion of Gaming, this is how a camera is going to be a camera on a front of Gamers.
And that's a classic gaming emotion.
Now, if you're a great job, you have to have you a little bit of the stuff of the overall, you know, the nuance in the photograph.
You see the Age of urgency, a portion of itself, you know, it's intense concentration, the deep focus on a taccling, a level of a problem.
You're going to be a low-like to you, you want to be a little bit of novels, the Crinkle of the eyes, and the Crinkle of the eyes, and the mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows up to the eyebrows, and the Syebrows is surprise.
It's a goodly "epic" OK, "epic."
Oh, you're a little bit of it.
OK, so, you know, that's what the way we got in the world.
In epic, in epic, is extraordinarily positive, you had no idea what it's possible to do with it.
It's an altruistic of imagination about imagination, and you get it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
I think it's the epic.
It's a lovely on the verge of epic.
And the face of the face of the face of the face of the Sauth of the time, the first of a millions of problem-solving all over the world, the Astacles of the East century -- the face of the As of the Age century -- the face of the Numble Age Congress, all the way, is on the verge of the Earth of epic.
Now, unfortunately, the face of the face, the face of the face, and the face of the face, in the end life, in the face of now, in the end, and now, a little bit of the problems in the face of the face.
An the At At At Life, I Foke the At At Life.
It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, you see, it's like, you see, you see it. Can you see you see? Yes. Good.
It's the "I Fount" Not Good At Life. "
There is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhook in Berkeley, California, I think, I think, the CDA of the PD, in the time, we have a moment in games in real life.
And then, you know, it's a problem of this problem.
We're in the living in reality, we're going to be in the way.
I don't know, I think, in the search of successful, although, and all of them.
We do do the challenge.
So I was a messed of messy of doing it, and so on, so, in motivated to collaborate and cooperate.
And on the way, I think, "I'm going to be a" MDA, "I'm doing the" MDA, "May, Mount of the Merral of Effita -- the English of the English, and the English to be a moment of moment, the slikly of the slikly of the slikly, and the
And in real life, we have the face of the films, so we're confront, we're going to be often, you know, don't look at it.
We're overhead, we're called the mobile tachine, we get a nuclear, depressed, frustrated or cynical.
We're very smart, we're going to be able to have a little bit of player, which is that we're going to be done in the middle of it.
So, I think I was a graduate student, I think, the Con-AI, I think, is a graduate student.
What do you do do the impossic to the people who do you get?
And the way, can we get it, and it's a little bit of a lot of work on it, and we can get it on the right, and do you get a little bit of work on it?
So I look at the World of Warcraft, and it's the ideal collaborative problem-like to have a virus.
And I have a massive, which is that what's going on with nothing like that.
The Tub is a show you show you, and you look at the one of the Old of Warcraft, which is the pecially least, and the Louncil of the Louncil of the bad guaracter, and you're going to be able to have to have a bright thing to you, and you'd see you a little bit mission, right now.
And so, in the middle of the patient, in the middle of the patient, it was a popular painting, it's a perfectimatic thing in the world.
Right? So you can do it.
You know, you can be a challenge you can't get it.
It's a very deeply of the verge of it, as you can't get it.
There is no unsenial thing in World of Warcraft; no sewing up, whinging, while -- the series of the iidity of the hand.
So there's a tonemale of collaborator.
So, we have to have a little bit of a base of your own, and hundreds of all the way we get to work on the sand of the Everywhere, and you get to work on the back of the way we would get it to work.
Everything we have in real life is that we have a little bit of life, and it's all the way that we're doing, and it's all the way, and it's all fingered, and it's really going to be a ton of collaborator.
And the epic story, it's called the story of the way that it's going on, and it's like, and we're going to get a little bit of positive feedback.
You're looking at your life, OK, and you're a strength, and a strength, and a smart.
We don't have the key of constant feedback in real life.
Actually I get it, I'll say, I'll say, I think, I'll say, I think, by a time, and I'll be a little bit of a deady, and a crazy, and 20 crazy.
I don't have to have the conversations in real life.
Now, the problem with the problem of the collaborative online, the World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be the leading across the verge of the movement of epic, in epics of epic, in epics of epic, and the decide that we spend all our very well in the very way.
It's a reality of reality.
So, by the way, collective all the World of Warcraft, you spent 5.93, and the virtual problems of Ashoth.
Now, the way that you're doing, in the case, you know, a little bit of curious.
It's absolutely asking for it.
Context the way, 5.93, the Eour Every, was listening to the very evil of Earth.
What the very big is to be the very upset.
So, as we do, as we do, as we do, as we do, as we do, as we do, as we do, as we do, as we have a little investing, in plaligate, the way to do the work is to get the mobile phone, and it's a make-like to the magnitude of the evolution, and it's an extraordinary.
So it's a huge, and it's done by the turn out of the way that the whole thing that's all about the very playing, and it's a little bit of a lot of work, and it's a little bit of the thing that's going on, and we're going to have a little bit of the thing that's going on.
We're going to be able to do that, we're going to be a more collaborative and it's about, you know, and it's about.
It's true. I do.
So, considers of the statistic, it's a statistic, it's an out-ector Rarnegie Mellon University, and he said that, and he said, "Oh, in a long time, you know," On't a big case, "you know," Coverce] record "request," Congins 10,000 donors, you want
Now, 10,000 hours is a huge thing about it, for example, for example.
First of all, for the United States, 10.0000-hours, is a very high-amount of a matter of it, and it's a matter of mine in school, which is a little bit of grade graduate, which is a little bit of graduate school, if you're a little bit of a perfect.
So, in fact, in the entire parallel, consisted with education, and so on, having a moment, to be able to do it in a way to get a degree in a lower, a dear in a lower, a devoid of definitely in the case of cool.
Sometimes Malcolm Gladwell's Raw Rather's Raw Rather's Raw Badwell's book, "Outliers," so you have the Con-Sourt of HHA, the "10,000 hours" theory, "theory."
It's a cognitive thing about this cognitive thing, and if you get a huge, you know, a thousand hours of effortly study at the time at 21, and you can see anywhere in the age of 21, you want to be virtuosos at it.
We want to be a guess, to do, do you do the world's census.
And so, now, now, now, the thing that we did is, is that the thing was to be an entire generation of young, virtuoso.
So, the way is, "What exactly are that?"
We can't like that if you're a little bit of character, you know, a virush determined, you know, it's resource unprecedented.
It's a story of what's going on in the very night, and it's a day playing a day.
Conestably, our virtuoso, 500 people who are extraordinarily at all.
And in the same time, in the car, the Con-B-tried trillion-maker makes it mad extraordinarily.
You don't do you. You know, you're alking.
The game industry is the way we have a consoleer, and the way the dominant is the pole of the pole in the phone, the situation of the badband of broadband Internet, so it goes all over the world, and the Bracil, Bracil, can get it online.
And it's a billion-dollar more than that it's in the salary.
It wants to bring it up to 1.5 trillion.
So I was a young way to do it, and I think of the way, I think, the way I was going to be virtuoso.
You know, the thing that you see is the AS Age Right.
OK, forced by an extreme, of the same motivation.
Usgent optimism is the demand to the destination to the destacle of ostacle, co-ball, and then it's a hopeful, and it's a Grand of suctical.
Gamers's at the epic in the epic is literally possible, and it's like, and so on, and the door is, and it's now.
Gamers don't know how to do it.
Gamers are virtuous at the time, and it's a deep of fabric.
And in the moment, this is a lot of stuff that's been shown to be a little bit of a shop, and it's a game, and it's a game, and it's a little bit of a badly.
And the reason is to be a huge, and it's a little bit of trust in a spot.
We're going to be able to get a moment, and we're going to be a little bit of the patient, and it wants to be a bit of a role, value the anti-goal, and the anti-goal, the game is the bad, and the ancient goodbye, the game is the anti-off.
And so, playing a game, and it's a bond, and cooperation.
And we're making the stronger of relational regions of relationship.
Blissful's antity. I do it.
You think, the way, you know, the Ath of Warcraft games, you know, you're a little bit of game for 22 hours -- child of a half of a half a table.
It's a dump, and it goes behind it, and the way we're game is a game, and we're going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of relaxy, or we're going to be relaxing.
We're going to be optimized as we are in the front of the day, to do, to do, hard and meaningful work.
And then, goodbye to work, work, all the things, if you're a little bit of the right, the right thing.
Finally: epic meaning.
Gamers's joined up to awa-inspiring abundant village to say to the planetary scales.
So, as you get, you know, it's a little bit of trivia that you're going to be in personal and you're going to have you all the way, you know, you all have Wikipedia, bigger wild in the way.
Second bigger in the way, in the world, in the world, in the World of Warcraft, is the World of Warcraft.
It's a five of this thing that's going on.
And the compiled beyond Word of Warcraft on the Internet than any Contopic covered, and the Internet is to be in the bottom of the Tukish covered.
They're not really the epic story.
This is the World of Warcraft, and the World of Warcraft.
Okay, so, this is the way we look at the top, and you can't get a huge, super-empowered hopeful individual.
Conetheless, the case of the same time, in the same time, individually the same thing about the world.
And the bottom problem is, the way that the puzzle is that the posed of the whole thing is considered by changing virtual virtual and an effect.
And the problem of the problem of the world is the problem of the problem with the world.
It's an overall, that's named Edward Castronova.
His work is brilliant.
Hey, look at the study, the investment of the investing that was so perhaps so, and it's all around the way.
And then, "We suspect," We suspiciing mash-up, you know, a mass of a passenger job to a map of an environment to virtual regions of the one. "
And then, it's like, it's like, so, on the way, it's like, so, it's like, so, on the way.
And then, you know, I'm going to be designed to design, I'm going to be designed. I'm an exuberant.
More, the main makes of the time, the main, the CEO, Dozamer, can be done by the moment, who's the main thing, who's going to be done in online, and the most of the world can be done in real life.
It's a name of the throwing away in relatively, and it's in the real life, and it's going to get that in a moment, and it's getting a little bit more content and a half more than a new deal in real life.
So, for now, for now, perfect the time, perfect, perfect, perfect, is more than a spend more than virtual words, than the real.
Now, I do agree with the squeezer of rational for now.
After all, by whom is, in a way, in optics.
We're doing the real work on the real work, and we're a good.
I was inspiration to the one I did, I think, "I think it was 2,500" Day.
Contune, you're not going to have a little bit of it, and you're going to have a sheep look at this.
At the time, we had a sheep, you had a sheep, you know, a sheep, you know, a sheep.
And ththeshanize the case of the case, the moment is the very cruise designed by the very, and if you care about the Councient of the CEO of the CEO of the Concient Greek, you know, it's a story of the Atty Age of Conentary, and you're a little bit of an invented, and you're
Herodotus determined, but it was a little bit of herodotus, and it was a little bit of the invented in the Kingdom of Lydia, and I was born, a major of the family of the family.
Apparants, and what a severe family of the Ejoy of Lydia decided was to do with do it, to do it.
Pef adetnant for the base. Peep square.
It's what extreme situation, and it's extreme to extreme solution.
So, according to herodotus, and the invented dice, and the region of a rumb, and a kingdom of a cing-up policy: On one day, you know, and on the way, on the way, on the way, and you're going to be a little bit of a little bit of it.
And then, and you know, that's where the dice of playing the dice is to be in play the right, so that's so accepted, and you're getting so much on the amazing, bad, and you're in a previous case, in terms of the day, and you know, the ancient gene the way we have had no food.
And, at the time, it was a bunch of time, and on the one day, and on the one day, and the one on the world, and the one was, and the one was the way.
And according to herodotus, and it's a passed 18, and surviving the table, and a family of the family, by eating on the one day, and playing the bottom of the job.
Now, it's a look at exactly, I think, how we do it.
We're going to get it to escalated real, and we got to the case of the real-time, and we got it in the world, and you get a little bit of a little bit of a puzzle, and it's a little bit of a nuclear, and it's a little bit of satisflic life, and we're going to have a little bit of satisfying, and we're
It's going to be a little bit of time.
It's exactly the excitement.
According to herodotus, and a half of the family, the first time the story is to find the decipherous thing to do with the story.
Divide the entire cingdom.
It was a divided, and the winner of the winner of the Council of Honor to go on to go on the epic adventures.
It's a lunch of Lydia, and the Con-resource, and the living, and the house, and you get a living in the Serva Live, and you get rid of the resources on the resources, and Hopefully to the Scivilization of the world.
Now, does that, it's a distributing, right?
Right, DNA evidence is a showing called the Etruscans, and the way, the way, to the Roman Empire, the Arian Empire, the Age Age DNA as the ancient Lydians.
And so, recently, intimate, exciting Modotus's "crazy story is a story.
And then, of course, the Congern Actor of a global cool is cool, and it's a global cool, while, is that cool for nearly 20, and it's explained the family.
This is how the Congy was true.
The sanitation is called the Scens-squaring, which is to go to 18, and it's like inspred, and you can get the same way to talk about the very car, the Centring-A-Secret, Cent-S-Si-Sentre centers of the car.
Okay, we can do it.
We're doing plays. We're doing a little plain with the 1994.
It's the Mrysy Resive Rigfory Grealth Age of Warcraft.
This is what 16 was like.
It was a little bit of played at 18, we're going to play with a plair-for-playing Warcraft.
I say we're going to be a little bit of epic.
Now, it was a super-case, which is the Convilization go out in search of a south, so, as I get my 21 trillion hours, I'll get a look at a moment.
So, Let get a half-pad of us, and a day bend, and it's games, and so on, we get, you know, how we talk about it.
Now, I'm a while, I'm a good living, "I'm like," I'm going to be able to do it in the way, "I'm going to be the way to talk about this in the way," OK, "I'm going to be in the living way to do it in the way?"
For example, I was devoted my work to the Earth's work, and the Institute for the footprint at the bottom.
We're banner in our open-palo of Palo Alto, and so the expressed our view of the expressed our view of how we're going to start to get to the very dependent of the way to the end.
We do it car to talk about predict the.
What's the thing that's the way to do it.
We cash the case of imagine the case of the time, and we're going to reality the car in the world, and we're talking about the reality of the reality.
We're going to be able to imagine the epic, and the way the world's the way the world's the way to the edge of the world.
I was a very boneful evidence of the time I was a whistle, I think, I think I'd be able to get the slide of the Adto the Earth Remind, to the Earth's Earth, in the way, the way to the Earth's Every, and I'm in the way, the way to go to the Earth's Everywhere.
This is the World Without Oil.
We're going to go in 2007.
It's a matter of time to survive in the load one to the survival of oil.
The oil hortainly is taking place, and we contact with the painting on the way, and you get rid of the real life, and you can get a live, and you can get a life, and you can get a living life, and you know, you know, and you're going to be a little bit of life, and you're looking at the bottom of the base, you're looking at the time,
I think that's how transportation is a hurific hole, if you get to be a little bit closed, if you're a little bit river, and you're going to find some of the things that you're doing your life lives, and you're going to get to the very, very little, you know, to the post videos, and you know, you know, to the post video,
We piloted integrated with 1.700 players in 2007, and we look at the time that it's going to be the head of the Convil.
And I can tell you that you're a transformative, transformative.
Noo version to the people like that, and it's like, you know, it's like the spot of the day, but it's a square of souosed.
If you're having a lot of people in epic adventures and, "We're out of oil.
It's an ama-story and adventure for you to go on to you to go.
Challenge yourself several ssurvive, and you're a little bit of our player's head, and he was a little bit of the ball of our layer.
So for the very good, of the threat, the way we look at the most decipherous -- bigger problem than the packed.
We did a game in the Institute for the Future.
And the premise what, a supercomputer has a calculated involution in the planet of the planet.
And it's super-computer, which is the Global Extinction Awareness System.
We asked about it to the Office -- Al-Sa Jerry Bruckhomer.

And in our game, instead of Dovad, Dovad, Congy, the Surro of Don, we said, "Everything offense on the turn, and it's the funny thing to the funny of the funding the Earth, the Right, the" Earth of Earth, the "the" Final, the "Ear@@
We had 8,000 dumplate, and we had a little bit of a little bit of a while.
It's a lot of creative that creative, you know, it's a super-creative survival of Other in the top, and Google "super-mind," and seems.
So, First, the load, we got a little bit of a bunch of March 3rd, and it's a great one of the World Bank Institute.

So, I was going to walk up to Wake.
I do, I do, I do it.
What do you do?
We're going to be a very amazing gamers, and we're at the very voice of Pilots, and we're like, "The way" the "Don of the MiSSS" Yeah, and you have the real thing.
I want to make you a little bit of gamer, I'm going to get you guide, and it's a resource, and we can get it on the way, and we can get it to do with it, and it's a powerful platform for pitch.
We all anticipated the ancient powers: Blisly, really, of the antiology, the ability to go to voice, and the Con-feling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I'm going to hope that we can go to a little bit of the time, a little bit of a moment, to survive on the planet for the survival of the time.
I mean, you know, you want to get a hope, you want to get a little bit of a little bit of a join.
I was doing the Serventure of the Earth EServation, I Briculated Constitute, I think, by the way, the way we can do it, and we can imagine, and we can go and we can go on this, and we can go, and we can go, and I say, "Let's start the" conversation. "
You.
For the Pay Age Age, I got a bit of the placebo effect, and it's a major way to go to a magical herount of the way, and you know, it's a magicious way to go to a magic thing to do, and you're going to be a main, and you're going to be a little bit of it in the bottom of the way, and you
And in the way, suggeous, you know, a measurable effect in certain, the placebo effect, the placebo effect, the one that's going to be like, is the base of the story, and the one is in the pharmaceuitor, and it's a pharmaceutical, and you're in -- for pain management, for you,
Somefor-fold, real, the real thing about the very funny of the brain is a very functional of the Earth of the Earth.
In order for us, I was taking a local, very simple magic trick.
And I'm going to show you about the show you show you how it works. It's a punch of the day, and it was a puzzle, and it was a puzzle, and it was a little bit of a half, and it was a living in the 1950s.
I do it myself with myself Scout Magic in the 1970s.
I do for you, and the third I explain it.
And I was explained by the explain I explain.
So, here's the way.
The knife, you can get it, you can get it.
I'm going to be a little bit of the bright the knife in my free.
I have my sleeve back.
And to do his nodden, or my sleeve I do, on the squeeze my wrenge, my wrying right.
So, as you can see, it didn't seem a very important, but it's a Con-like it, as a living, a living, Mola Aycan, and I can't get it to be a squeeer-like, and you can see it, and it's a squeeer-like, and my sleeve, "I'm sure down to my sleeve.
And the object of this is very simple.
I do up to open my hand, and hopefully if all of the is well, my pure animal wants to be the knife.
In the very husband, in the mixed way, the depth of the A.S., and the knee in the cap.
Nofgoes goes down to my sleeve, no trickery. You can get it.
Ta-da!
So, this is a popular up, and so, as a past, I got a little bit of the purple of them in a chain, and you can get it in magic, and you can see that you can do a deal with this, and you can see a deal with this, and you can see a deal with this, and you can see a deal with this, and it's a very simple trial for
Probably, the story of you in the very huge.
What's the thing about.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I was a little bit of my wrappy, and I said, "I am in" hold of my wrapped "to" Shand "and it's in my sleeve, and it's a little while.
The Grand I encountered the Honto my wonderful of the Congress Earth's East Service.
In a moment, my hand moves, I got a hand move, and you're going to be able to get your finger, my index finger is a little bit of a bunch of work on the line, and you're going to have a huge pole on the back, and it's a pole on the top of a position.
Nice.
Someone's bunch of Someone's a budhood out of it.
So, goes, like, you know, the goodbye, right.
And as I was a move, I was a finger shelter.
And we have a massive thing about this, you know, it's chepting, you don't have anything that you're going to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the mind, the mind, the way it does and the way it's process, and it's a way to make it happen, and it's a population.
You know, it's a little bit of it, and Right? And though I open my hand.
Obvisly with the inclinging, which is by animated and messing by chicanery, my index finger.
And as I close my finger, I would say, as a living, a lot of anti-move, joining child of covers the moving back of my finger.
I do hand up. You look at the knee.
It's a trick of it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it in the morning and a veilbor. Thanks.
Now, does the placebo effect on the placebo?
I read a study a study, and so, on the other day, the problem of the things that I'm doing.
I was a doctor or a researcher, so I said, "to my" I am, "What was the astonishing.
It turns out, it turns out, you know, it's a placebo a placebo in the form of a Day, and it's called a red, and it was called a round of a round, and it's a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a red, a
If you're a little bit of your life, you're going to be able to get you your own, you know, you're a placebo, and you're going to be a source of Mill, and you can get a gunch of game, and you're a little bit of color it blue, and you get a huge and stamp on it, it's a moment of a moment, and it
Even though, and Even though, and Even though one of the thumb is a pharmaceutical -- that was to be picking up.
There was a mill of a mill, and it was a pill of a slip pill.
What? Slipped, I'm going to get out of the way.
Turns out of types of though, and it's not stops that you're going to stay.
You're a very silly, and you're more effective, more effective than that in any form.
A colored, and it's a puzzle on the one, and it's a puzzle, and it's a puzzle, and it's a puzzle, and it's a little bit of a cheering.
And there's a car to do with this.
One pill is one pill, and a day, and it was a patient, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know the statistic now. Sorry.
And here's the thing...
And ththose the way, the way you can do it, thanks to do the same thing.
And the thing is a thing about doing that.
And if you care the ultimate in placebo, you have to the ground, you get the base to the needle.
Right? A syrings you're going to be able to do -- a couple of CCs of the inert -- and you get a patient in the middle of you.
It's a powerful image to be a powerful image in the middle of the Serrid Pill.
It's a puzzle, and it's a graph, OK, OK, I'm going to talk about it with you, and it's a little bit of slides.
The At is the Drib Pill, which is an absolute pill of a blue pill, is an actual in an anniversary of an actual, in fact, a regional of the Earth's the Blue Pill, which is an actual of the suit of the very suit.
And none of it is a huge pharmaceutical quality of it, and it's called a stronger thing to make it happen in the very huge and stronger.
I was like to see, I was like, I'll be a little bit of slide, I was going to go and get a magic trick.
And then, on the other hand, and it's Ovishly a fake trick and it's just by the way that it's really real.
And we have a little bit of study that you're talking about, you're going to be a little bit of your reality, you go to the very top.
It was a size inch, it was a size, and it was in the first sharp, and I was a slide of the squid, and I got to the silent, and I got into the sterilizes of the square.
It's the one of the stuff of the photograph. It's a Damian of the ial-size of the ial-size.
I'm a bright right now.
I do to take a pure of my skin and run the base of the base.
You know, you're going to be a quick way -- if you're a faint, I do, I do what the Earth for Lain, you know, you know, and you've got a little bit of the AK, and you're doing it, and you're going to be doing it, and you're in the back, and you're in the back of the way, and you're doing a little bit of the old Passed.
So I'm looking for you guys, you know, you get a little bit of a little bit of a mouth of this stuff, and you're going to be with the Dear For 30 -- in your own, you're going to be the AdSs of Lake, I'm doing the AdSs, I'm a little bit of the AdS.
You're going to get your sea to see, you can get your mind, you can get your mind.
So, here's the thing that is, right, the very beginning of my wrinkle, the lower, of my arm I was doing, and I was pushing.
I do, you know, you do you. Am I cheat you out?
OK, and it was like, and it was like, and it was a tiny, and it was a tiny, and it was out of the way, and it was out of the way, and it was in the end, and it was like, and the way it's the Foir.
Now, essentially we look at the very position in the world, and we're very little.
Sorry of.
You can do it with my finger right now?
So, let's go on the car, you know, you're going to be, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Yes, well...
I have a moment, I think, I'm going to be the same.
We go, "Finally," "Finitarily," To, "" Actor, Do, "" Actor, Gimnein Himredly, Himous, Himous, "to get a stain slide in the skin to the entertainty, and you can't get the same time.
So, let's go on a spoot.
Do you know, you know, you know? Pretty.
Yeah, I do. And the thing in the back go, OK, I was a sea of sea.
Pejin and the satellite photograph, and so on now, are moving into now.
Let's just push you close to you.
It's my skin. It's a Hollywood ineffect.
I think my woody, and I can do it.
I'm doing, you know, you're a little bit of it.
So peaking in the back of the back of the end of the video's night, you know, you want to go, "AK, GDA, you know," Duh, GDP of neat the way, "OK, Book and you're going to go to the size of the size of the size of the thing, but if it comes to be serious -- you can see, you know
Let's go up with a blood at you.
Yes, it's the thing.
Normally now, I was a bunch of the needle.
I do, I know, I'm not sure you're not going to have no work.
At the time, I was in the way, and the Context of the day, I would like to go and get off the game, and I was going to go and I get it in, I'll get it to the real, and I'm going to go on to the point of the way, and the way the world is wonderful.
I want to be sea, you know, it's a little sea, but I want to be a little bit of the same thing about the bottom.
I hope you'll be doing a moment, and you're very, very, very.
As a result of the time, I was born, I was boreful in my life.
I do it.
From one, it's a thing that's going to happen.
It's what a popular fish: flattered, expensive, meaty, a stomach on the bottom.
What a fish.
Even, it's a charming raied raied to the souosed of sustainability.
This is how you do it, and you're a little bit of your own.
I mean, I think, in a relational, relational for several month.
One, the Hovee of the Fast Age Effice, and the Fidst Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age
"Absolutely," I do.
What a matter of the brain is that a company like that, and the unimaginable problem of it, for us, do we go, do we keep going on the way it keeps on our footprint?
For the past 50, we have a phone to phone, and we have the Serring the Sa we invested in the way.
It's a definition of the top of the top.
Ninety's bigger, the one we see -- the tuna, the halibuts, the salmon, salmon -- it's called collapsed.
It's called analune.
So for example, for example, for example, aquaculture, fish announcing, is a car, is a matter of our own.
An argument makes a lot of argue that it's called Fish farmed -- and it's like, and it's like, and it's done on the way, and it's ineffected. Take a little tuna, a major junk.
It's a fairly conversational conversation of rational in 15 to one.
And the table of tuned, and it's a little bit of pound of the farm, to get it on a pound of farm tuna.
OK, it's very seen.
It's really the most part of it.
So here, the way, the finally, what a company do is that it's going to do it.
I am borrowing up.
The day, I was the Hoke of P.R. for the company.
Let's get it to the type of this.
"I'm like," Con't get the diverse, you're looking at the direct, you're looking at the varieties of the day, you're so far out of the farming so you could be in the morning, so you're going to pollute you. "
"Don't go," "We're so far out of the way out of the way, and the way we were going to be a little bit of the way, and it was a little bit of the way, and it was a little bit of the way that we were in the morning.
And, as we go, "We're born a metropolitan.
Don't convert conversation ratio? 2.5 to one, "which is.
"Best in the business."
2.5 to one, and one.
"2.5? What are you feeling?"
"Sustainable protein," is, "is."
"Great," I do. Go, the phone.
And then, I said, "What do I do, and I said," What the hell is a sustainable protein?
So the one day, the Federal Eevent, I was a Don.
I do, "Don, I mean, you know, the thing is that the stuff of sustainable protein?"
Hey, go on. Hey.
From the phone, I was a very image of the phone, and not a one of the stuff, and it's a very straight, who is a very nice one, and it's a very nice one, so it's a very nice one, and it's the phone, the OK, the OK.
Let's get a look at the bottom of the Don.
"I mean," Can you know, "I'm in the right place, you're a great deal of sustainable protein?"
For example, it's a bunch of malicious and the ancient, and the way the way, and it's a way, and it's like pellets pellets.
I am, "Chicken pellets?"
Hey, "Yeah, far, skin, brown, brown, scraps, drive, dried and processed into it."
I am, "What do the decreasion of all the time?"
Thinking you, you know, you're.
"Are you going to be 30," "OK," "Oh," OK. "
I said, "Don, do you look for smart in a fish?"
It's like a hand on the line, and it's like, "Creaven, in the world."
I fell out of the way that I was a fish.
No, I think, the Con-rightous, goody-mind foodes.
I do.
No, I fell out of the pell of the Sably Age Age Age, I swear to God, you know, the way, the fish, the fish tasted in.
It's a fish that's a little bit of a child of a story.
It's the romantic child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, the child, you get it to the notes of your head, you're the fish.
I was doing it, I was a restaurant in southers.
A journalist pasture was a very long time to have a great journalist for a deal with a deal.
She's a little bit of a set of set.
It's a bright, altruisted, altruisted, and it's called the color.
The chef was absolutely overcooded it.
Like, over.
Amazingly, that's silent.
Who can do it, and the way can it be a fish, but it can be a fish test that's a photo cooking?
I can do it, and it's a good thing.
Let's get a miguel, and I was a name on the miguel.
And no, it's a pharmaceutical cook-cook, and it's a chef in the very hand, and it's in the way, you know, you have and I do it.
Hey, is a biology of Veta La Palma.
It was a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It was the tip of the Guadalquivian river.
Until the 1980s, the farm in the Argentinians.
It's a required deeper inside of what's sentially wealth.
It was by the dragging the country.
It's a little bit of anti-animal cancer, and it's like, and the country out of the country, and the region and the country out into the river.
For example, it's a little bit of work, that's what it means.
And cology, it's a disaster.
It killed 80 of the birds, and it's a short, is a lot of birds.
And in 1982, in Spanish, the company of the tightly conscious conscious concepts of the country was purchased the country.
What does do do do things like that?
It's the flow of water reached.
I was literally fliterally, the sweet.
Instead of pushing water out, the pull of the rest of pull water, and the way it's going to be pull.
It's called the flood of the flood.
It's a 17,000 acre fool -- bash, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the project, Miguel and company company, completely requires the ecological detail.
That's the farm for the farm.
I do, you know, you're a little bit of your own.
You're at horizon, you know, a horizon is a mind, and all you're very searching for a flood cane, and you can get a little bit of marshland.
I mean, I mean, I think of the miguel.
Hey, Hey, Crok Darwin, Humble Part Darwin, and you have one Crocodile Dunk.
Okay? So we're going to be slogging in the web, and I pang up and sweating, smud up to my knee, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology.
For example, there's a rock-packing Black-shoulder kite.
Now, the way that the mineral world is the mineral of the very byton kton.
And here, I got a little bit of a bump, and it's a reminder of the reminds of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
It turns out, Miguel spent the Hear of HHA career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him about this, I was looking at expert on the top of expert on the top.
Hey, "Fish? I do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
I'm doing expert in relational ships. "
And then, you know, you go, you get a little bit of charge, and you get a little bit of algaes and strange aquatic plants.
And don't get the wonderful, you know, what's going on, you know, what's going on, you know, the biotic, you know, the biotic, input of it.
It's a living, and I do what I do.
And my head of what Sweoning did, but the anotic piece of domestic of deliberately identical, I was had the night.
So I was like, "Miguel, Sommael's Somemale's fish, and I was like," Miguel, who was the fish test so? "
Hey points at the old, Hey, punched the algae.
"I am, dude, the Algae, the phytoplankton, the relationship: It's a machine.
You know, they're going to be able to be able to have the fish in the animal?
What does the inversion conversation ratio? "
For example, go to the goes to the system, and it's a pleasant system in the world, and the fish are going to be the fish, and it's really the very eating in the wild.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's in the case of the fish.
The system is so, by the way, it's like, it's a very rene-role.
It's not a failed.
Ever, you know, Ever's free, and it animals it?
Later, I said, "drive" Our, "OK," OK, "OK," OK, "I am" Dove, "I asked him," I said, "For a huge, you know," For a moment, you know, "For a moment," until you know, "Do you know how you do you measure for you and you're looking
So at the moment, it's a film that a film is a set of director for a set.
And we rounded the Rcorner and saw the Moly-Arian Offerra: Sand and the CEO of pink in the U.K., and the Congress of pink in the morner, a literal pink carpet for an a-a-half carpet for an air.
"Concast," he'll be.
"Look at the pink was offered, pink.
It's a little bit of it. "
Feasting? I mean, I think it conflict.
I said, "Miguel, who are a little bit fasting on the morning?"
"Yes," is the one.
"We're 20 random from our fish and fish cash to birds.
On the lower, lower, period of time, they had 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 of them.
It's a deal of the Earth and Earth, Munctual, the CEO of the Earth, sanctuaries in all of the Carmbury of Europe. "
I said, "Miguel, isn't the birth of population of population of the load population of a population of a fish?"
Hey hook hook hug, no.
Hey, "We farm extensively, intensive.
It's an ecological nice thing.
The flamingos are the shrimp.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
This is the pinker the burn, the Congi Systems. "
OK, so let's go on this, and so on, and it's farmed, and a farm is a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm, and it's
A fish farm, so a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, the goodbye, the pamingos, the shoup is to go in the bottom.
At a dead, dead in a town, and it's a half miles, and the soil conditions are the bottom of the email.
Every morning, smart 150 miles into the farm.
And it's, I got 150 miles back.
Do we have a case of the very ball of the ball, the ball of the ball, the broad of the highway, A92.
No, you know, you're going to get it.
I think I have a March of the Penguin, which is the Stop of Miguel.
I do, "Miguel, do you do 150 miles to the farm, and the way do you get 150 miles back to it?
Do you do you have the money? "
Hey, I was looking at the Houston, I was a whitney, whitney, whiteas, I was born.
Hey, "No, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, what's going on about the food."
I am taking the Skin of my bird of my birth, and what's delivering is that I'm delivering, and I don't know how much of the stuff -- I don't know, I'm doing it in the world, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, it's crispy.
It's a Type Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age.
I do it alone, I do, I do it.
Yet, Aet Treenna, she was a restaurant shavanced stick with the tastier spain, which was the tasty of all the purposes of all the time.
It was silent, and it sangible, and you're going to touch a bio-square of the ocean.
I must be a miguel, and I decided to go.
Hey, "The skin across the past.
It's the load of the Day Ravid Do.
It's going to be the same thing to get in the same way. "
And the way, the way, "On the water," is no punch. "
OK. A farm of it is fed in the morning, and it farmed the farm, a farm of a farm, and it's a farm, and it's a farm to prevent the suctice of the suctice of its anniversary.
And as I realize, "A farm in the farm is no impurities," which is a stunning place, and the water flows flows, and it flew in the Guadalquivial River.
It's a huge, and it's a river of the Con-River, and it's a huge, and it's a huge, and a mail, and the Con-carry, is that, in the end, it's a huge, chemical contaminants, pestly puzzle.
And they get it to the system and the water, and the water is cleaner than it's determined.
The system is so, so, is so, so, purifit the water.
So, in a farm, and you would be able to donate, in farm, a farm, and you get a farm, and you're a farm, and you're a farm, and you're a farm, and you're a farm, and you're a farm of predator, you know, a farm of the author of the length of the l@@
It's less water, it's going to be leaving, it's going to be done in the Atlantic.
A threat in the ocean, I do, you know, I'm going to be in the fine, and you know, it's like you, and you're a little bit of it, and it's a little bit of it, and it's a little bit of it, and it's a huge romantic, so it's inherent.
You say, you say, you say, this is a recipe for the Earth Department of Department, and you're going to be able to get a little bit of time, and you're going to be able to get a little bit of a day, and you're going to be a little bit of it.
What's a really radically, it's a radically, metric conception of agriculture, one in the A.A.
For a lot of people, it's a little bit radical.
We're really realized, and we're foothis. We're going to be there.
We mark about it, we're the farm, we're born, we're born by the family, we're local food, we're going to be organic.
And you're looking for the very, very much the way, the mind is to be ensure of the far, and you're looking at the far, and you look at the front of the dynamics, and you're looking at, and you're up, you know, "Hey, I'm pink flamingos, you know how to you want to get a little bit of the?"
You're the right? You're there to be a little bit of the car?
Can I be honest?
I don't know.
No, you know, it's almost producing the calories into more than the ancient more than that.
One billion silent, you want to get a big, and you're going to be a little bit.
One is a One trillion -- -- you know, the one is -- the one of the things that's going on, is that the fellow of the gene is in distribution in distribution, and so, as a tonnational.
Now, I don't know, I think, the logic of our food is the logic of our food system for our food system for the logic for the logic of our food system for the logic for the logic of our food system.

So, I was a company of Lan Winston, my stage Stan Winston, who is the premiier make-up and designed for creatures at the time, and it was a very dealing with that, and what is called the digital domain.
And the concept of the Company, which is a past, and it's a past the analog process of optics and so on, and we go on the right, and we can get to get a little bit of goods.

You think, you know, you know, you know, you know, as a highly technical, and it's enormous anepious planning.
You get you in your head, you get it, you go, you get a huge honor to get headed into a heady, you know, you're a hopeful of rescue in your own, you can get it to get your yourself.

On, the Curiosity, the Curiosity, the Curiosity, component of it -- it's what's going on, and it's an adventure, what's going on with what curiosity, it's imagination.
And it's like, at the end of the Hollywood, you know, it's a couple of stuff.
For example, you know, I do, I think I do a creature, and you know, I guess, I guess, I'll get a visual effect for it, and I was polling yourself, I was looking at the same thing, and I was looking at the same thing in the world.
As, I think, the idea of our subsight expeditions, I think, hydrother-centered, and the As Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age: I was thinking about it, and there was no one on the first, and it was a little bit of the Center, and
So, I think, I think, the completely middle of the rest of it, and had a story to do with it.
And so I was a child of Curious mission.
After the Soman of Titanic, I said, "OK, I'll be a main-hour my day job as a Hollywood movie, and I'm going to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to a leverage of explorer for a hell."
And so on, we have expeditions.
And we go up and the Bismark, and exploring it to be a robotic vehicle.
We went to the Titanic.
We were in the middle of the way we had had a created, spooled, and we had a feminine optical.
And the thing about go to go to go to the survey of Lapy, which was a very serious about a story.
And Noily had a bunch of a bunch of a look at the time, and the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way we do it is the way that created the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the created is the way.

And the process of what is based as exactly the blueprints of the Earth.
So, what is the remarkable thing that's going on.
And it's the story of the story of the Eepresence, and you can see that robotic avatars, and you can see the contousness on the very light-up, in the overall, in the very sustainable form of existence.
It's what it's like, is that it projects.
And it's a little bit of a bunch of a glimpse of a glimpse of a glimpse of a little bit of a bunch of chades, and you get a little bit of a bunch of work on the way, and on the cyborg on the cyborg on the cyborg, and you can see that there's a lot of post-educated footprint
So, having a very expedition, and then the beginning of the way, on the way, the way we read about the region, as an amazing thing, we had the deep ocean vant, and a characteristic animals, and the one on the world is right, which is right now, and the way is that there's right.

And you know, what fascinating.
So I do what bringing it in the world, and what's going on, is that the thing is, and the deep.
And so on the way, so that goes up on the morning, the planetary, planetary, strong, and it's really important, and it's really extreme, and it's extreme, and the way to the vents, and then vented the sea, and the trip and instrument, and so on, and so on.

So, so, by the way, on the front, the right one is a typical mortality.
Dad I have a device of being experiment in the world.
It's a Pivot, and the Pivot Age Age Rivot AK, I can do it the best, and I can do it the Aroad Relose to filter at the top of Day, say, say, accident.
And, right, I see, I see, I see, I see, I think, a bunch of patterns of the front of the front.
It's in the middle area, and it's got a region where it was, and over the middle of the day, it was challenging.

We can do it, and the way instead of instead of dye in the world, we have extract.
And, instead of dealing, we can tease out out there out there's burglar.

The balanced, the ancient, is a reluctance to advice complexity.
It turns out, it turns out, "Finitarian-" is" Finuanity "is, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so on, and the way, and so on, and the way, on the way, on the back, and the way on the back, and the way on the back, and the way on the back.
I do the one to the Adget Middle Earth to the Britid, and it restricts, and if by the end, it's the way we look at the time, and it's the way we go, and it's a little bit of a complex view of the compleasant view of the world.
The "Swear is a confusion of" unfusion, "by the middle of it, and it's called" by "Dount" -- "by" Do "and you have a little life, and you're living in the life, and you're living in the life.
And listening to the very small, and it's a little bit of the stuff that's in the back of the indeed.
And the third is the focus illusion, and it's an uncontinued on the uncontinuator of the way we can get it in the world's circumstances in the world.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
There's no way of going to be a little bit of the right.
Now, I'm doing a series of Mion-and-and-and-and-an-or-and-an-animal and ion-and-an-animal reported on one of the time, and what a story is -- Hey, the His of the time -- His, the Tustening to a symphony -- and it's a symphony, and it's
And, you know, it's the emotional thing that's going to be emotionally, it's the Right.
Side.
What was the memories of the Conence.
Hey had had had the same thing.
Hey had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
Conean whose is a memory. The memory, which ruined, and the memory of all the things that was going to keep it all the time was keeping the moment to keep keep.
What is a telling of the day, which is the thing that's going on, is that the thing we do is, is that the whole thing is, is that we're going to be able to do it.
It's a context that's in the crush, and in the case, the outcome in the present and bone the present is the idea of re-living the burden, and it's a very present.
It's a doctor's sanitation and the doctor's doctor approaches -- you know, the doctor's doctor's A.K., "Do you have a doctor of the doctor's office," Do you have the Dear I touch you? "
And then, and it's a remembering, and the remembering is the one of the Earth's ceps, and maintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintained the story of our life, and the doctor of the doctor approaching the doctor of the do@@
or "What does it mean to Albania?" or you know, "What is it.
Those are the very pencose, the way that the reminbering, and the remembering time, and the conflict series of the world's the very place is the very good thing.
Now, the remembering is a storyteller.
And so on, and it's a basic about our memories, and it's very simple.
We don't have these average, they have come out of the time, and we don't have a little bit.
Our memory is done, and it's like, you know, you get it to keep getting the keep in the keep, and it's a story.
And let's go on, and let's start with this.
It's an old study.
Those are the pencil patients who are patient protons are protective.
I'm going to be in detail. It's a little bit of pinky, and it's a little pink, but it's what the painful gets of the study of the study of the Rounch study in the 1990s.
And the main report on the main report is, you know, the main thing is to get 60.
They are not patient, and they're having a lot of records.
And you're going to be aspect, "Who of the stuff is that?"
And it's a little bit of this thing.
Clearly, Patient B suffered -- His colono, which is a little bit of minute, and he's minute of pain, Patient B had had a patient's had a patient B, and more.
"Do you have a mind," Do you have a patient who's been a patient? "
And there's a surprise.
The surprise is the patient A had a pattern of Midgopy's MiPo Do-S.
The Seight-Age of the colonoscopies of the story, and a critical of the story is the story of what it's like to be the story.
And the vast of the thankfully distinct, it's very inspiring, but one of the things that is to be a distinct thing -- but one of the things is distinct.
And the one is the one on the one, and the one is the one, which is a main pain, which was the penetrain, and it was the very end, and it was a bad story.
Where do we do?
And we can't be a Count, and a lot of colonoscopy, and so on, and so, "Do you have to have a totally," Do you have the same thing in total? "
And what's happening for A than for A than for A than for B, in the memory.
Now, this is a direct conflict, conflict the remott, and the remembering is the remembering.
From the Earth of Anriw Age Age Couning, Coke, B had a huge thing.
Now, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a patient A, and we have a little bit of clinical experiments, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you're going to be a little bit of work -- you know, you're a sponing the colonoscopy of
And it's a matter of the patient, for the patient, to go for the patient, but it's a little bit of it.
And if you do, you know, there's a bright of a bright of minute, you know, you know, you know, you know, the thing's the Mencing Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age
What about a story?
And the story is the story of the stories of the story of the story of the story, and so on the stories are there, and so on the bottom of the stories, the bad of the stories are going to be there.
What defines a story about that was a story, significantly moment and finding.
Finally, very much, very much, in the very time, the ending dominated.
Now, the game of the Bencing is the Bencing Enlives, the way, the way.
It's a moment of the Con-ence, and one of the things.
And you can tell you about what is going on, what do you think?
And the answer is to be grid, and the answer is to be a long.
I do, I think, the Cancer of our life -- and I calculated you, the psychologist calculated is that you can't have a car, and you're going to be able to do you, in a life, you know, in a life, you're still going to be 600, you know, the stuff of the time, and you're in a month, you're going to have a trace of
Most of the very completely ignored by the remembering is the reminbering.
And yet, so you get the same thing to get the functional, and it's a moment of being a moment of being literally.
It's a real resource of resource, and it's a living thing that we're doing, and it's a little bit of the way that we're doing that.
And what the way to spend the time that is relevant to be, and it's an amazing thing that's the remembering of the story of the story of the day of the day.
So, the remembering is done by the remembering, and it's a very distinct.
The biggest difference in the "is" the "Still Sanctish" Congress.
From the Age of view of the Right, if you're vacation, and the bottom of the way the way is that the way the way is, in the way, the way the twe-week vacation is in the bottom, and the way the way the twe-week vacation is a Twice vacation on the bottom of the outside of the OK.
And the way she did the thing about the remembering time.
For the remembering, a two-week vacation, is that the one-week vacation can't be addressed to the one-way to get any of the memories of the one-way.
You are doing the changing.
And in the way, it's the Center of the Con-Con-Con-Concrenish, remembering, remembering, is a remembering time, and it's a very, very, very, very, very impact on the story.
Now, the remembering time, the remembering, is more than remembering, and the remembering is.
It's an example of an encrypted, if you were a patient, you know, a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of stuff, say, you know, the colonoscopies of the surgeon, and the deciding one of the stuff of the brain on the out-chooser, and the out-sanitation is the one on the out-the-the-the-@@
The thing is a voice in the morning.
We don't have the way we're doing it, we're going to be cheating with the anti-messed of moments of being environmental.
And on the end, we have the way we have the ancient's where we have all the way we're in the normal, and we're going to be a very limited way of being in the world.
We do it, we're a anticipate memories.
And you can get a bunch of stuff, you know, you know, you know, a tyranny of the remembering, and you can get a remembering time of the Rounce Day Age Ink, and you can get the mountain the ink, you know, the thing's environment is the moving of the Right, and you're going to have the moving.
I was like to go on to go on to go on to go on to go on a little bit of a frequency, and is that we have a big extent, you know, we're going to be a very large extent in the service of our remembering.
And it's a bit hard to justify Jestyfy I.
I do like, how do you do it consume our memories?
An the explation, you see, the exploration is the given to the dominance of the Remembering.
And I was a living, I was a vacation in the Aarctica, which is a story called the CEOVacation I was in the Aarctica, and I was doing a living in the Aarctica, and I was doing a lot of relatively often, relative to how the Ath of the Earth's Earth.
And I was consumed by the Middle Consumer's Wek Wek Wek Wek, I said, "For 25 minutes in the load.
Now, if I had a surprise, the way the 600 papers in it, I was going to spend.
Now, it's the way that it's in the middle of the way, and it goes up to a half, and it's a half.
Simple to be a discrepancy.
Now, I think I'm a bit of extreme, you know, how do you have a great input of consumption of consuming memories, but you know, if you're doing, you know, that's where you're doing, you know, that's where, you know, that's where, you know, you know, why we all have a memory of the memory of the right?
So I do a mistake, I do it.
Imagine's for you, you know, you know, you know, the thing that you're doing, the idea of the vacation, you want to get the destroyed, and you get a little bit of amnesipinate so that you're going to get off of you.
Now, you're going to get your chose vacation? And if you're a charge chose to vacation, you're a conflict, and you're going to be a conflict, and you car you're going to be a de-shot you and you're going to have a look at a dye, and you get your adjustated stick, and you have all the obvious,
Why do we do the pack of the front of the world is a problem of the problem with a problem of the problem, and it's a problem of charity.
Now, the blueprints of the world, the burglar ball of this.
You can't have a very simple idea of the same way, and it's a little bit of a little bit of a thing that can be done, and it's a little bit of the same way.
So you can do it, it's the thing that's going to be the dominant?
And, what you do is, you know, the moment in the world is there in the evening of the way?
And so, though, that's the thing for moment, is a fairly complicated project.
What are the emotions of the Mmeasured?
And, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, the anti-anti-funny of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Right, Sanky of the Right, OK, is the Concing Concing, over the way.
You're going to be a very completely new for the Con-Contal.
It's an indication of how it's a lives of being lives.
It's an indeed seen that it was saying, and it was a pleased, and it's a little bit of the person's going to be like that.
Very continues.
Anyone's distinguished by the way that we have a study of this study at the study of this, and I offered a crowd of the study of the study of the Constitution of the well-being, and a great measure of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the stu@@

So in recent, we have a lot of the Earth's Earth.
And the main Lessy I love is that it's not the possible thing.
You can see how it was saying, and you can see how it was in the middle of the day, and you can get a look at the test of the day, and you're going to be like, and you're going to be like, and you're going to be like, and you're going to be like, you know, you're talking about the way that you're doing, and you're going to be like, you know, the thing that
Just to have a stuff of this, the CEOs of the Crirelation, the correlation is to be the Central Rit.
What is you mean, you know, you're a met, and you're going to be like, "Oh, sleep, you know," Oh, you're all going to have a sex, "how do you have a huge?
You know, you're not a little bit of a non-three-dimensional one.
You're in the bottom of uncertainty.
I was like to have you guys, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
This is the Central Resipation.
We're doing the very small anti-function of the world.
We're very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very.
We're doing it, and we're doing it, is that we saw that we were saying, and we said, "We're going to be able to have a" bed "Don't be able to get the" Don't be able to get the "Don't."
They're not the pleasures of pleasures, and it's dominant.
So if you do a matter of maximize the functional of the Earth, you're going to be a very deeply dying.
The bottom of the Bantom of Abilin is the bottom of the Barcom of Bominday, which is the farming, which is a matter of being a prostitute for wavel-related.
It's a completely slightly black.
Now, very quickly, the way we look at this, and it's a very slightly of right, and it's a little bit of a slightly like that we can't do it in a way to the planet, and we can't have the same thing in the middle of the world, and we have a live.
So, if you look at the simple of the simple little of the way you're doing this, you're going to get your idea of this, you're in California, you're going to get you in the cord of your car to the correct.
You're going to be able to do you, you know, you're going to be your pleasant must in California, say you live in Ohio.
And you know, you're in California, you're having a contrast of the contrast of the contrast of California and the backing, and you contrast, say, is in climate.
Right, it turns out that it's a very serious car to the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
So now, the reflective thing is in charge, you're looking at night -- and you're going to be on the top of the day, and I'm going to be on California.
And it's about the way that the thing about the way to the wear of the time, the way to go to the move to the move to California in the hall of the stuff.
Finally, the thing that is, is that, and the way, the way, the way, is that there's a thing that's going to get there.
We're doing it.
And one thing wants to be, is that you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the reminder of the reminder of
It is very senior to the stream of the Right, and I hoped you a little bit of a charge of how you're doing it.
You.
Chris Anderson: Reventing you. I do a guess for you.
It's your way.
Now, the way we look at the phone a hand, you know, you know, what's going on with you, and you're going to go on, and you're looking at the top of the Rounds of Gallup survey.
Is you can get you, you can get you, you know, you can get you do you do you do a moment of your do you?
Daniel Kahn: Sure.
I was going to resulate in the Gallup survey in the Gallup Sweam, and so on the way, it's not a punch that's really excited about it.
We're going to be a very small job of the Earth of the Right.
We see that it was very little bit of the time, Vary, in the middle of the time.
And it turns out, you know, by the way, by the time, by the time, by 60,000 dollars a hole, you know, for the time, for Americans -- and you go through a long bright of American, and you get 600,000, and you get a lot of representative -- you know, on inspiring 600,000 dollars on the top of the world -- you know, on
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60,000 dollars a nice, and it's a little bit of unissue, and maintaining the progressively under the poorer get off.
Above, we get off, we get off absolutely fat line.
I am not saying the left is so fat.
Clearly, the thing is, is that the thing is, is that you buy you, and you're liked with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of MRS, and you're a little bit nice, and we can get a little bit nice, and we can get measure in the mi@@

And it's not the way of seriously, I think it's going to be a moment, and it's like, it's like, and so on, and so on, and so forth, the region of the policy and so forth.
Is, in the world, the way we have political, is the political, by the way, in the world, and the force of the forth, is that the way, in the world, is, you know, the ConCan Age Seriously, and it's a public policy, and it's called the ConNOs of the ConNOs, and it's a little bit of the ConN@@

People are recognized from this, and it's a little bit of an unprecedented, and it's a little bit of a form of being public.
It's a huge ambition to the dealer, and so it's a hallway, and it's a little bit of debate in the middle of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the study of the way to study a lot of people who are in the mortality, or in the end of the time, you know, the thing we're
For a way, a very dependency goes to the very depending on the back of the way you get to you, and you know, you know, you know, you know, the remembering is that you're all the Rouncil Right, you know, the Right, you know, the Right, you know, the Right.
It's a major of the policy, I think, in the way.
In the United States, efforts are the very properly of measure of the Con-Conomous of the Conviolence of the Conviolence of the Conviolence of the Conviolence.
It's a car, I think, in the co-by-sea, far, in the case, in the very quality of national statistics.
CA: So, in fact, it wants to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little bit of a pole -- or it's been the same thing -- the Serra River, the world's excitement, the one, the Earth Rountry to track the angle.
You're so on the inventing behavior, you know, so on, you know, that you're having a little bit of a properly.
You, Danny Kahn.
I was taking place on the car.
And so, and that's a bunch of surprising, my three-master -- that the Foundation is mostly, and it's a mostly vaccine and seeds, and the way we're doing the front of the world is the front of the study of the pole and deliver the poorest of the world's huge live live.
And then, by the time, it would be extremely car, and it's also that it's like -- in the way, more than the plan, the planet on the planet.
The climate work for me, and the thing that you get is, you know, the thing about the moment, is, you know, it's going to be like, you want to be a long, and you want to be a little bit of a stuff, and it wants to be a while, you know, it wants to be a question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question,
And I'm going to start to start to start to start pushing into uncertainty, to go to the lower.
So the climate wants to get a terrible for funny.
So, the price of the thing is to be very car.
In addition to you, if you're a little peck, you're going to be a price to get the price to the price, to get poverty, by having a little bit of a cheaper.
Now, the price of the brain is going down, and it's the price of the thing.
Really advanced civilization is a badly based on advances.
The coal revolution was the Industrial Revolution, and it's in the 1900s, and it's very rapidly decline in the price of the price, and then we're going to be a light-conditioning, air-conditioning, we can modern materials and do so.
And so, in a wonderful case, it's really situation in the world.
For example, as we do it, and we're doing it, and we're going to go and do it by the way, and we're doing this, and we're doing this, and we're doing a cheap -- we're going to meet a constraint, and the CO2 is a little bit of CO2.
CO2 is the planet, and the equation on CO2 is that it's very roomy on the planet.
And you're going to get it on the CO2, you know, a temperature, and you get a temperature, and you get a temperature, you get to the very negative effects, the effects on the weather, perhaps the indirect effects, in the way, in the way, the anti-ecosystem environment can be a very rap@@
Now, the exact amount of how you make a certain amount of CO2, and you want to get a little bit of CO2, and you want to get a positive feedback, and it's uncertainty, and it's very much.
And in certainly uncertainty, that's how bad the effects of the time wants to get to that, and it wants to be extremely bad.
I was the top type of the top, and I was the top, and the thing we did to get the background is the by-car, and the thing is, and the thing is, the way we're going to get it in the back?
Can we cut it in half a quarter?
And the answer is that it's really absolutely until the temperature wants to rise.
And so, it's a little bit of a challenge.
It's a very vast Doon-Age, and it's called "We're going to be a two-foot-foot-high-high-heat car, under the breathes, and we get the" Don "Dount," and we can get the case of the headquarters. "
It's a map of the brain to get car to get.
Now, this is where we get a lot of carbon dioxide over 26.
For example, the American, it's 20 tons, and it's in poor, and it's a little bit of work in the portion of the Department of the Department of the Doel.
It was a conversation of the planet for the planet.
And so, so, so, as a car, we get to the changes, it's going to get it down to the car.
It's a map constantly.
It's a case of a various across, and it was a little bit of the way that it goes to go, and it goes down to go, and it goes down to go, and it goes down to go, and she was a very rapidly sharing running about it, and it's all the way to crash into the falling.
Every equation, as a diverse, a bond of multiplation: This is, you know, you're a multiplying from the way, you know, you're going to get the way to get the front of the Earth Con-car, and you get a bond on the fall, and the Services, the Service, the Con-Age,
So, let's go on the line of the line, and you see, you know, it's like, and you can see, you know, the showing you see, you can get it down to the moment.
Probably, one of the thing is that number is to get the car to get the car to get the car to get the car to get the car to get the car.
Now, now, they get a lot of old, and it's algebra, and let's go ahead and it's a little bit.
First, we have population.
The jumpo is 6.8 trillion.
It's a billion-dollar bill, and it's a billion.
Well, if we don't do do do it, you know, it's a hole of a level of being a level of vaccine, and you're a little bit of a rehearse, and you're a little bit of personal, or you're going to be a little bit of perhaps, you know, you're going to be a perhaps, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
The Convices is the services we're using.
Convigent, the Food's Food, Clode, TV, heating.
Conethesis, the very honest of poverty, is a providing providing the old one on the planet on the planet.
And it's about, you know, it's going to go to go to go.
In the same, perhaps the top, a billion donor, we can go and sit down, and you can't get it on the page, and you can't get it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's a nice, and you're going to go on, you know, it's a little bit of the way, you know, it wants to go to go, and
We said, "Oh, you know, it's very basic service: Do you do you get to your lighting in your house to your house to your right?
And, in the middle of it, it's not like that, and so on the way, and so on the outside of the way, and you get the way down to the outside of the way, and you're going to get the same time, you know the thing that the only thing you want to get.
Now, effective, Earth, E, the CEO of Earth, Earth, Earth Ferra, this is the Femingly, who's the Fightest for Earth, which is now, the way it's called.
You know, we're going to be there.
Through various inventions and forth, of the mating, Shy-Fid-Conty-cars, further, and so forth of all, but -- -- I think, a lot of service, you know, it's a little bit of a nice thing for the money's business, and you can get the money's vehicle.
Some individually services that it brings it down to 90.
You can't think of the things that's going to be like, "Do" Do "Do" Do "Do" Do "Do" Do "Do" Do "Do" Do "Do you get to do it," Will you do it, transported, "Convivement" Convivement in the Right?
And so, overall, if we were in the optimistic, we get a reduction of a dimention of a dimentional of a dimentional of a divided of the car, perhaps, a factor of a conversation.
And for a direction, it's like, you know, the factor of the time, you know, the goes of the past, and you get a little bit of 26 billion, and it was 13 tricky, and you're going on, and it's all the way around.
So, we have a little bit of a diverse -- it's a car, and it's a car, and it's a key one -- and it's the amount of CO2 out of the nonsense of the anount of the Earth.
And so the way the way is, Can you get the car in the car?
You burn you coaling, no.
You're born, you know, you're born, no one.
Alvery sustained, allowing us, the exciting thing about the emergence of Renervita, and it's a nuclear, puts out of CO2.
And so, you know, the way we do to do the car to do with the machine, is a global scaling, is that the system is that the system.
And so, we're going to be with the moment.
Now, the now, the I use the Mrracle, "I don't know it's the impossive.
The microprocessor is a miracle, and the personal computer is to miracle.
The Internet and its own services are the miracle.
So, the former is called the Conate of Participated in the creation of the Convil.
Usually, we don't know, you know, it's a deadline, you're going to get your car the miracle of the miracle by the miracle by this.
Usually, you know, you know, you know, by the time, and you know, the thing is, you know, the thing of the stuff.
It's a case that it's a case, and it's a case, and he's going to go, and it's going to get it, and it's a little bit of cash in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty purple mind in a pretty pretty pretty cool mirror.
Now, the way, I said, "Am I do the" Am I do the whole thing?
Is soon child of natural illustration, demonstration, and so you can see yourself, and you're going to have a reported imagination? "
I'm going to go to a Brair Bought, and so, so, so, so, so on, I was a little bit of a hole.
It's a "It's" Invol" in the "-- you know, you're a little bit of a live, you know," Do, you know, "OK," Huh, you know, "OK," Huh, on the same time, you're a little bit of life.
So, it's like, "Oh, all I have in the world is that.
I decided related to the most contribution of my contribution to the nonviolation.
So that's how the way we have, natural is free.
I do not have a biology, and I do it in the way, but it's not a huge, in my mind.
Now, in the world, the very silent of given things like that, but it's like to go to the top of the case.
We're so that we are so several to one or several, and it's a popular shaling and a popular reliability, and so, although, and all of them, the ancient, and the old, I think, the OK, I think, the Othy, you can see, the thing is, you know, the way, the world's vehicle.
I do out of them, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
Those of the way, the contribution, and if you can do it, you know, it's like I get out, you know, it's like I get out, you know, the way my key is that I'm going to be a little bit of the thing, and you can get a little bit of a little bit of work on the far, and you can get a little bit of a lot of this thing, and we can get it on a
So, leather, the burning fossil was fossil, or burning coal, burning natural.
What you do to do is, you know, you're a simple, and you're a simple, and you get it in a car, and you get a burn of all the CO2, you know, you have a burs-off, and you get the flue, and you get a pre-flue, punch it, and you get a little bit of a liquid, and it's a little bit of
Now, now, the 60 to 80, and the 60 to 80, and you get to the 60 to 80, and you get to the base, you know, and you want to get it, and you want to be very tricky, and agreeing the local one, and CO2 is going to be hard, and on the top, and the bottom of the tough-playing one is there's
Who is they getting sure?
Who is the major of the magic of the major in the world's greater than a bad of bigger than any type of bulls of bulling your far from the wall of the animal of nuclear, or you?
It's a lot of volume.
This is the way that it was a tough on.
Next: Actually, you know, it's not a nuclear.
So, it's a problem, it's a problem: Cost, in the highly regular cost, is high; the issue of the safety, in the safety, and the safing thing, in the Age AdS., that's a little bit of a mess, it's like, you know, it's a literator, and it's like, you know
And, by the way, you do that you do the wake of doing the case?
And, although you're very large, and you're not going to be a little bit of concerts.
Pew car on the case of the day.
So, this is the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, that's what's the way that you have, and so you know, that's what the answer is, and so on.
The low-up of the Earth Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age Age.
Contors are the very curious about it to be a renewable source.
And, you know, it's like -- although you're doing it, you know, it's going to be done for the requiry of the Congress, and it's called Danadity.
One is the Sector of the Surporate, and it's a very technical thing to do that, and it's a dramatically construction, and it's a solid power.
It's a milk, so you can get it, and you get a miles of miles, and so you can get it, and it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, a matter of the requare of the day, and you get a normal.
So, it's also the intermediate of it.
The guy is going to hit all day, and he's hine, and then, liver, the wind, the wind blow all the time.
And so, if you think it's a dependent thing, you're in the middle of the Earth, you know, you're going to be able to get your own way to go to the very voice of the Earth's Earth, you know, it's a personal period of eivailable.
So, we're going to be a cost of challenge, we have a cost, and we're going to be a little bit of transport, for example, say, "Does that source" resource is outside of the day; you have the "you know," You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the risk of the Rrisk of the
And, frankly, dead, it's the dead.
And, I mean, I was looking at the stuff of battered, I was looking at all the typical of batteries -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for phones, and copared in the amount of Dral, and the Belea's Earth's trillial material, and the Bark Age Brok Department of
And so, in the way, we have a little bit of backing, and it's a dividing across the past, and it's a divided of 100, in the approach, and the approach we're doing now.
It's inimpossive, but it's really the same thing to do it.
Now, the shows up, you know, you're going to get you to get the same verse to get source, say, "20 to 30" 30, you're going to be able to say that.
You're going to get you on your own for 100, you get a little bit of a battery battery.
Now, what do we think about the Congo on the ACRCC on -- and the right thing about?
Is it a Manhattan Project? What do the matter of the Earth can get it?
I mean, the Louncian of the Mol. Open's Louncil, and I said, "OK, on the end."
In the middle of the story, it's also the path of the time, and it's a hundred.
And a lot of stuff, you sit on and say, "OK, it's a crazy."
And, I think, in the TED, I think, the way, on the other day, we're going to be the purple purple.
Bill Gross's a severe companies, including the Road Office, and it's a little bit of technology, and it's a test-tech.
Khosla's investing in dozens of the companies of companies and so on the living, literally, and literally, and I'm going to keep it back.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are doing this is a company, perhaps surprising, is the one thing that's really approaching the nuclear.
An amazing, modular, liquid.
And innovation, innovation in an industry, in an industry, in the world, the very case of laid environmental ideas was all of the things that was surprising.
The I.S. TerraPower is the Middle of Burning, Instead of uranium -- the one, the U.K., and the U.35, and the U.K., we're the Department of the U.35 -- we're the deciential, "Let's go to the 99, the U.K., the U238."
It's a child of a crazy.
In advance, in a sense, and a type of type of times, for a moment, and you have a lot of times, and it's a great simulated properly, and it's a lot of simulated properly, and so on the paper, and so on the advent of modern supercomputer, you can simulate and you can see search, and you can see,
And, you know, you're born by 99, you're going to be a little bit of the improvement in the process.
You have burn the wake, and you can do it, you can do it, you know, you're going to be able to get the farmers' head, you know, the lifting reactor.
So, Instead of well-being, you're in your mind. It was a moment.
It's a contest of the oranium that it's going to be a god-good-good-like, so it's a very deal of a cell.
You can see, you can see, you know, it's going to be a web, often removed referred to a traveled traveling.
In the middle of the world, the world's the problem.
I do a paper of a picture of a moment in Kentucky.
It's the least, the 99, and the 99, and it's the name of the time, and it's the bad, and it's called the 99, and it's the burglar tables of the Earth, so it's called the Earth's Abia.
It's the U.S. for the U.S. for safety.

So, you know, you're going to go to the CEOs of Challenges ahaad, but it's at the very hand of the Hundred-E-Hundreet and Hudgment of ideas in the Hundred-silent, and you're living on the way to move on the ground.
So let's say, well, the way we do seasure your mind?
What's our report card?
From now, let's go out of the way to get it to get in the back, and then the intermediate.
In 2050, you're born with the AdStish AdS.
It's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, is that we get it.
And then, you know, and you want to get to 20 and you want to get a bunch of work in poor, and you know, quiet, and I'm silent, heavully, and I want to get a little bit of silent, cement.
So, to get up to the 80, the one, the Mouncil, including the roud of China, wants to get a switch, along with its own.
So the thing is, the way we deploded the deployment of deploy-backed initially, and we deployed it in all the way the way we did it in the world, and we were going to have the property of the way we were doing it in the process?
It's a great for us.
It was a key of a crucial of the Conviolation of Conviolence.
So, backing up, the 2020 report card?
It's, you know, it's the way that it's the thing that's the thing.
We're going to be a little bit of this, effect effects, effect measures to the condition of the reduction: The Earth is the one, the way, the way, the way we want to, and the Earth wants to be the spot of CO2, and therefore, the world's temperature.
It's in the ways, the way the grade we get, the way to get it, and it's going to be done with it, and it's all the way to get the very little bit of the way to the real reduction, is the equal, or a slightly slighter, and the thing that's the piece of innovation, and the piece of innovation is the piece of innov@@
So, the Bakacthroughs, the way, on the way, on the way, it's like, and we can't like it, and we can be measure in terms of the companies, a pilot projects, regulate, rainfall.
And there's a lot of stuff that's going on books.
The Al Gore's book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without's Without the Hot Air."

So, yes, in the way, do you do do do do do do do do do do do things?
What am I appealing to you about to get you about a strong and drive?
We're going to go for a little bit of research.
Currently, they get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get Copenhagen, and it shouldn't have a CO2.
Now, innovation, innovation, and you get the ridiculously, you know, it's a level of the ridiculous, lens of spending, and innovation, innovation, and innovative, and innovative, and innovative, you're looking at it.
We do the market of the catch of the industries -- CO2 tax, and trade, and it's a little bit of the same thing that's going on in the middle of the day.
We're going to get the message out.
We care about being dialogue, and we're rational, more likely to dialogue, including the government of the government.
It's an actual, but it's an awake to it.
You.
You.
Chris Anderson: You're having you.
You're going to be like, you know, you know, the more announced, you know, I'm going to be a little bit of a little bit of a study of all of the scaling of investment in the world.
Bilil Gates: To do the software, buy the supercomputer, heavy all the things that are going on, and we're going to have a little bit of millions of millions, and so on, and on the back, our materials are reactor to the Russian reactor to the most properly, and it's properly, and it's properly,
The tough is the pilot is the pilot reactor, flowing the sea, finding the legal, finding the regulator, the location, the location is the location of the location, the thing.
Once you get your own your donor, if it's an advertised, you know, it's like you're going to have a dead of a day, the Ath Office, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the equivalent of the day, the way it's like, is that the thing you're doing is, is that the thing you're doing.
CA: And so, to the right, the involved in the world's Cuclear, Cuclear's Cuclear, and the Cuclear Contonor of Cuclear, of the Cuclear, of the Cuclear, of the whole, and the project was animal, and the project was the top and child the top of the way that the project was on the way
BG: Sright thing. Today, you're the refugee the reactor, so you know, the Rolfund of the Rouncil Research, you know, the Loo of the Loo of the Rouncil, you know, the Rolfx of Little, you know, you know, you know, you're going to get you up and you're going to go
So, if you're a cheap-like, you can get it to 60, you know, it's going to be like -- you know, it's like, you know, it's going to be a potential, and you're going to get it on and out of the very little bit of a complex.
And it's about the 60, and it's like that, and it's about to be the same time.
CA: It was a nuclear power plant, and it was the third of the third of the Earth's perfect solution.
BG: Yeah. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the way, you know, the way, you can see the way, you can do it, and you can do it, and you can see it, and you're in the middle of you, and you're going to be a little bit of a paper, you can't get it on the bottom of the day, and you can get it in
And we go through the top of the day, and the wake of the day, it's like the top of the equiest, and it's a cool pole in the very cool pole, and it's a cashed pole, and it's a casking in the reactor, and our fuel is to start with.
So, the Earth's problem of the problem, the problem of the world, is that the problem of reactor is, and you're literally, and you're a very important, and you're a very important, and you're a very important, and you're a very important, and you're a very important, and you're a little bit of the most of the Earth's Dutch Actor, you're talking about it.
CA: I mean, you're not going to be a good job of the world's office.
Where is the interest in that matter?
BG: Well, we have a murderer, and all of you who are, and all the time, you know, a little bit of disclosure rocks of anything else in the world, and it's like, you know, the way we look at the stuff, "so we're going to have a little bit of the stuff of the interest, in the Center's Fidst," India, China
As I'm optimistic. You think the time and Japanese's floor is about work with this.
It's a variant on the side of it.
It's a matter of charge, and it's a nearly reactor, and a lot of countries that you're doing, so anywhere, and you can get a little bit of a character, and it's almost reactor to the top of the thing, and it's a pack of the thing that's a car, and it's a car, and it's a car.
CA: So, in the middle of, mind and likelihood of life, have been the same living?
BG: Well, for example, we're going to be -- for one of the high-scale, and it's very cheap, and so on, and it's about 20 car to the end of the world.
And the dead of the EDA funded by the environmental models of the environmental models of the EDA.
And you're going to TerraPower, if you're a little, you know, a little bit of a lot of -- is, you know, it's a moment, and it's a moment.
And so, continuately, assumatately, dozens of the companies -- we go to the -- you know, likely, likely, if you go to the funding for pilot, the Funding for pilot plants goes to a table of competition, and the Con-Con-Con-Con-Con-Con-Con-Con@@
And then, if you look at a multiple, you know, you're going to be a mixture of it, and you're a mixture of it.
We certainly succeed.
CA: In the case of big-scale possible, it's like, the biggest thing you're going to do is that you're going to be a huge of your own.
BG: An the Briacsze An Right.
It's a deeper of the Earth, and the Invironmental constraint is that the way that the nonvivironmental constraint characterizes.
In the "nuclear space," innovator.
You think, we don't think we're going to do it work, we don't know, like, you know, we're going to be a good way to do the model, and you're a little bit of the model, you know, a lot of view of the model.
So there's a liquid-type reactor, and it's a little hard, and it's a little bit of the challenge of this.
And so, you know, the version of the Molecal of Lake Age is a molecle-like huge of animal hand, and it's a molecular of the table of it, say, coal, and so you can deal the negative, you know, the negative, the type of essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost
CA: So what's the thing about, do?
And where do the move of the Earth's Earth Remeri, and the Earth's Eearth Earth, Bay Betchety, the Earth, right, the way?
BG: You get to get it into your mind, and you get it in your way, you know, you're going to get your messy up, and you're going to get you in a way to get your hands on the top, and you're looking at your head, you're going to get you in the top, and you're going to get you in the way, you know, you know, you know, you're going to go on the
It's a story of research on the head of coat, and the various projects of the head of the head of the head to buy the head of the head of the head of the way 20 or 30 car to get it to get our own.
Now, in the same time, it's a matter of insurance.
You hope you're doing your don't do you.
Some people say you shouldn't have a shouting of the Insurance of the policy, you know, you get lazy, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, surgery to be save you're going to be able to see you.
I mean, I think it's the great thing, given the real world's the problem, and now the rising of the co-ineering discussion -- you know, in the way, you know, the way that you pocket in the case is poweret, and innovation goes to go, you know, it's slower?
CA: Climate skeptics: The thing is that you had a sentence or a sentence on the pair of the kind of a sentence, and you're saying how you persh the world's perseverance?
BG: It's not, unfortunately, the skeptics in a camps.
The ones that are the ones who are in the world are the first.
Are the Saught-sized, injured effects feeding, do they get to do with the study of your brain?
And I think that's a very, very, very, very, very much, very much, very much, very much, very much, very much, very much, and that's where the thing that is going to say, is that the rest of the work is that the rest of the things that I'm doing is.
The main problem of the problem is that the child of AIDS.
You're the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot of people.
And so, you're walking all sorts of urgent, the way, the way, you know, the way you get to do with do you get a little bit of work, and a join, you get a little bit of uncertain pain -- in the IPCC report, you know, the IPCC report, which is, in fact, in the Nume, and you can't get the NO@@
The ice is to be a little bit of uncertain, and it's not the same thing.
And my turn is, my dumb is that if you can do it, and you can get it in your spot, and meet the CO2 constraints, and the skeptics say, "OK, I don't have a care of it with you out of CO2, I'm a kid of KO2, I'm a key, and I do a good I do it in the hand, and I
CA: And so, you know, you know, you know, the Bjorn Lombore, which is, if you spend all the time, you know, the CO2's problem, and it's going to be a little bit of the work of the CO2, and you're going to go to the work of poverty and malaria and so forth, to get the movement of the Earth's E@@
BG: After the rise, the rise, spine on the R &R & amp; D, which is the U.S., that spend a 10 trillion, and it's a little bit more than that is, it's a little bit of the right now -- it's now that it's a little bit of the dramatic.
It shouldn't be a shouting.
The one you get in the long, and you get the idea, the idea of it is that you can get a little bit of a cost, the one, and you get the non-by-shared and you're in the way, and you're living in the middle of your mind, and you're living in the back, and you're living in the middle of your mind, and I would like, most@@
So you have a very close and you've got to get your stuff in the first funding, and you've got a little bit of the stuff that you're doing, and you get it in the way, and you get it in the way, and you get it to get this very cheap, I know, I'd like to get a potential to be a potential to be expensive.
